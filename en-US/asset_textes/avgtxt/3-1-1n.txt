PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Zdravstvuyte, Commander. Griffin unit Makarov salutes you.+Though this mission is a disgrace in itself, it is my honor to serve under your command.
M1895(1)<通讯框><Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Hey, what do you mean, 'a disgrace'?! You're to rescue a veteran with very venerable history!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:As you can see, this is our rescue target this time - a T-Doll designated 'Nagant M1895'.+You probably already know her... Or should I say, you can't possible NOT know her...
PM(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Haha, why would the commander not know me? Remember how our friendship burgeoned on the very first battlefield?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You probably find it hard to understand the point in rescuing such an old, weak, noisy and commonplace T-Doll.
PM(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Hey, watch it! Or I'll appeal to Gospozha Helian to demote you! A demotion, you hear?!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:However, during our last operation, she inadvertently discovered an important object that needs to be brought to HQ post-haste.
M1895(1)<通讯框><Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Hurry up already, Makarov! I'm still holed up in a Sangvis warehouse!
M1895(1)<通讯框>;PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Nagant M1895, do you remember the number of the warehouse? Or at least give me some description to work with.
M1895(1)<通讯框><Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;PM(0)||:I told you. I rushed right in so I didn't pay attention. It's crawling with Sangvis mechanical units outside. I'm dead meat if I go out!
M1895(1)<通讯框>;PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) Then please stand by. We'll come as quickly as we can.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:In any case, let's make our first move.+As Griffin's main forces are aiding in a military operation, we are severely understaffed here.+We'll have to join up with the T-Dolls stationed in the area and rely on their assistance.+Commander, please guide us on our way.
