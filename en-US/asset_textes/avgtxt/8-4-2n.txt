AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:What a funny question. A T-Doll hooking up to this console, overwriting the communications protocol, connecting to the Commander's channel... +... and not being turned into a Sangvis unit via the Parapluie virus. What are the odds?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:There's about... +...a 93% chance of failure?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:If you care to hear my opinion, I'd say it'd be better to simply post a warning on the dissing forum.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:We'd become a laughing stock if the only thing we do at a Sangvis communications outpost is posting on social media.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:You adamantly refuse to harm an ally, yet shove dirty work onto me to clean up. +These double standards of yours are hard to comprehend.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Most T-Dolls wake up in a repair bay even after suffering total annihilation. +I don't know about others...but I think...I can get used to that.

AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:For the sake of this mission... and for everyone's sake... I am not letting go of what I believe in. +Not to mention... you're here with me.

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Wrong. I'll remind you again and again just so I can enjoy the sorrow and confusion on your face. +"It was all because of my indecisiveness," the newly awakened IWS would say.

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Then please remember what you're supposed to. +I'm tired of having to remember stupid things for you.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Can't be helped, I'm afraid... I'll have to trouble you one last time. +If you're the team leader, I'm sure you'll do a much better job than me.

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>54</BIN>:It isn't. You're just using the wrong port. That's a deactivated server you've plugged into.

IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:AUG... Why...?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Pick your questions wisely. I'm already getting interference here.

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:To be honest, I'm tired of this. I've already heard most of what you just said once.

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Of course you don't remember... +You forgot all about it when you woke up in your repair bay.
AUG(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:...AUG fishes out a device.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:That's... +...a combat record storage bank...?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:SSG retrieved it from your remains. I promised I would get it back... +So that you won't end up poisoning the Commander, bumbling oaf that you are.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:You still remember...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:You were actually quite endearing when you asked me to escape with the intel last time. +You knew that once you get out of the repair bay, you wouldn't be able to let go of your failure no matter what others say...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Well, I was right...

AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:You seem enamored with Dreamer's words. Is there something wrong with your head?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:Nein... it has nothing to do with Dreamer... I honestly believe that. +This thought pervades me... whenever you're by my side... every time I look at you...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:How unfortunate... +But leadership doesn't really suit me.

IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>54</BIN>:After losing your memory... you'll probably mock me first thing when you wake up.
