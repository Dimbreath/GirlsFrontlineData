NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Isn't there any way to contact any of the commanders? +What about the Military? Any response from them yet?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Comms Officer A</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ma'am, we still haven't been able to establish communications with General Carter. +The engineers have already eliminated the possibility of Parapluie interference. Right now they're checking the pathway to see if it was damaged by Sangvis Ferri.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Understood. Keep trying until you get through.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Comms Officer B</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ma'am, a Griffin T-Doll beyond Parapluie's coverage radius is trying to open comms with us. +We've authenticated her identity and she's not infected. Shall we allow the connection?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Could she be a messenger from one of the commanders?) +Permission granted.

MP7(0);NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:"Caretaker of Caretakers"...Could that be me?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(1)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm a messenger sent by my "Caretaker". I ran all the way out of the jamming radius by myself to make contact with HQ...Hello? Hello?
MP7(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Go on, Gr MP7. What is the current situation out there?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:It's terrible, but not terminal. Our Caretaker is reorganizing our echelons. +It's been a struggle, but we managed to gather all the Griffin T-Dolls in sight and we're preparing to continue our retreat to Area S11.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:We've been attacked by both Sangvis forces and Parapluie-infected military units. There hasn't been any response to our attempts at communicating with the Military, so I'm guessing they've left us for dead.
MP7(0);NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Mind your language, Gr MP7. Do not make any statements that cast aspersions on the Military.
MP7(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Return to your Caretaker with these orders from HQ: the top priority now is to retreat to a safe area, and if conditions permit, you may rescue other Griffin allies, both humans and T-Dolls. +Your Caretaker has discretion over the exact orders to be issued, but they are to stand by for further instructions once the withdrawal to Area S11 is complete.
MP7(0)<Speaker>MP7</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Sure, I can do that... +But things being what they are now, is everything okay over there with you and the "Caretaker's Boss"? +The Commander is worried that HQ would suddenly...you won't let me say it, but you know what I mean, right?
MP7(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:HQ is safe, you don't need to worry. Ensure your own survival first. +At the very least we know that you're alive. That's good news. Thank you, Gr MP7. +This conversation is over. Thank you for your hard work. Go back and make your report.

MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><Night>:... +After this, all I need to do is send the info back via drone... +Caretaker said that I didn't have to return to the battlefield once I managed to escape, so...
