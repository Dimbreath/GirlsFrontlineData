M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Persica!+...+Calling Persica!
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Oh, yeah. I'm here.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏2>：Sorry. I was checking on M4.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Persica(0)||：How...is she?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Everything is...going according to plan.+But that aside, RO didn't see you do anything back in the database, did she...?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：No, I already had it sorted by the time she came out.
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：I see... How are you doing?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Humph. You'd better not tell me...it's not too late to regret my decision.+But I do have a question. Let's just say it's some wild suspicion caused by instability in my neural cloud. Can you answer it?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Now that we're here...ask ahead.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Regarding Lyco's death, I ran a search in Griffin's database, and 378 reports stated that he died in an accident.+So I don't understand why you're so hung up on it...+Whatever he's done, he's already dead. Why do you still care?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Because his death was extremely suspicious.+Even if he did die, it couldn't have been an accident...+Which is why I'm not buying it.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||：Ha, who knew you can be so astute.+Are you really just a scientist, Persica?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Like you, M16, I've had some narrow escapes from death. Survival is a skill.+In any case, that thing is your target.+The commander will hold off S.F.'s attack so that you can investigate safely.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Investigate...that strange signal source...?+When on earth did you notice that?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：When RO infiltrated the Sangvis mainframe and started searching for File No. 7...+I secretly conducted a multi-channel search on the network using RO's neural cloud and downloaded an interesting file.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：I want to remind you that all files in the Sangvis mainframe are potentially virus sources...+Humph, but it hardly matters now, does it...
M16(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Even RO herself can neutralize that kind of feeble Sangvis virus, but that's not the point.+The reason I downloaded this particular file is because it's encrypted in a way that's completely different from standard Sangvis encryption method.+Therefore, this is a message. An invitation that promises anything but a fool's errand... You got the coordinates, right?
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||：Invitation...you say?+In all my days on the field, I've never received such an ominous invitation.
M16(2);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：What? You're feeling skittish now that you've come this far?
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||：Even MY neural cloud can suffer a breakdown... Especially now.+...Too bad...it can't be backed up.+All this experience...can't be of use for M4.
M16(2);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：You seem to...think about her in everything you do.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||：Yeah...+This is all for the sake of protecting M4...+This is the only order you've given me, and it's absolute.
M16(3);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：I'm glad that you still remember.+She'll wake up very soon, M16.+If you move quickly, you might still make it in time to tell her goodbye.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Nah, it's fine. I don't have time to think about what to say...+Better get on with it. That's...the only thing I can do now.
