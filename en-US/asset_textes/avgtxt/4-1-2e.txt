M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Commander, Miss Kalin. This is what we discovered at the coordinates.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:That's...an audio file?
NPC-Kalin(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes. I will play it now.

NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2>:'They...are in your...house?'
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What does that mean? Who's in my house?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:It makes no sense. Could it be some kind of code?
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmm... It does seem to be encrypted at first glance.+Hold on a sec. I'll go take a look...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><BIN>8</BIN>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2>:Done! Looks like we've got ourselves a new set of coordinates!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:I did not expect...Miss Kalin to be so capable.
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What? You're practically calling me an idiot!+But of course you wouldn't know such an archaic encryption method!+Still... we can hardly learn anything from just a set of coordinates and some nonsense like 'your house'.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:...'Neural cloud'.+The so-called 'neural cloud' is the host of our memories for us T-Dolls...+Even though the original body can create a large number of dummies to protect itself through dummy links.
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But even so, the original body is still at risk of being destroyed under extreme circumstances.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Indeed. Once the original body is annihilated, the T-Doll loses all its memories and is reverted back to its factory settings.+Which is why when network connection and logistics allow, T-Dolls always backup their own neural clouds before deployment.+Or in our language, upload our memories to the server.
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Backing up neural clouds takes a really long time, but it's definitely worth it for the sake of preserving your battle experience.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:During infiltrations, though, T-Dolls cannot upload any data to the server back at base in order to remain undetected.+In this case, we backup our memories to video logs to constitute easy recovery in the future and to provide information for others.
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Right... So you suspect this to be a backup copy of someone's neural cloud?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:It is just a wild guess. We need more information.
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:In any case, we seem to have stumbled across something intriguing. Don't you agree, Commander?
M4A1(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Exactly! Then let's hurry towards our next coordinates! I wonder what we'll find there.
