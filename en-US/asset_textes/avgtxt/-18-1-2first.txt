NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Your place is messy as ever. +Any other investor would be lamenting the waste of his capital if he saw the state of your lab.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:But you're my investor, and you'll thank me for spending all the money on the cutting edge. +What took you so long?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I still can't see how you didn't waste my money. +And as you know, shaking off all the eyes on me took a lot of doing. +I take it the people on the other end are too busy fighting to talk, right?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange needs more leads and evidence, and I want to know...the truth about Lyco.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:What do you already know?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I saw how Lyco died... He was dead by the time Elisa was activated... +Shot by one of our Dolls. He was going to destroy a document titled "OGAS System Reactivation Report", or something like... +Mr. Havier, what exactly is the aim of reactivating the OGAS System? What did you and Carter do in 2032?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Humph, Griffin and the Sixth Directorate were both played for fools. Carter's a very smart man. It was no coincidence he rose from a lowly officer to a general. +...Regarding what happened over 30 years ago, all I can tell you is that we worked together back then to foil the rebels' plan to detonate a secret installation near Minsk.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:A secret installation?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:OKB-413. That's the damnned codename for the Relic site.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:The Relic...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Carter was in charge of seizing the target, and I led the engineers in disarming it. +That facility was specially built on top of the Relic site in order to test and calibrate "Pike". +It used a unit node of OGAS for its processing.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I remember OGAS... +It was a cutting-edge network framework that was used by the former Soviet Union in the 80s for their nation-wide automated system...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Correct, but the prototype was probably even older than that. The equipment and system plans were both excavated from the Relic site. +While this is just a conjecture on my part, given how advanced that thing was, I'm thinking that it must have been some sort of automated control system for life support within the Relic site.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:While carrying out the mission, the rebel troops even tried to overload the "Pike" system in order to cause greater damage. +Although the entire system only activated for a moment...it was more like an ignition... +However...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:However...?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:The Relic site emitted a high energy signal in response to the ignition, and if I hadn't been there, I would have thought that the entire Relic site had exploded just by looking at the instruments.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:So the Relic...was activated?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:For just a moment. Carter led his assault team in seizing the control room. +Right after shutting down "Pike", we cut all the cables, and that was the end of the OGAS system in that sector. +It was just a moment, but I'm sure Carter will never forget it.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:So the Military's aim is to...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I'm sure you've already guessed it by now, Ange.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker></Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:How did you know I was here?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:The moment I came through the door, Persica opened a secret channel to you. Petty tricks like these are useless against me.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Tsk...you old fox. But going by what you said, things are worse than I expected.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Yes, that's why I came here. +To the Military, World War III was forcibly terminated, and the government now wants to form a coalition government, fraternizing with their former enemies. This is nothing short of betrayal to those military men who lived through the war. +Therefore, their political aim is to activate the Relic and drag the world back into another Cold War. +Remember the phrase "mutually assured destruction"? Humph, absolutely disgusting.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:But what does this have to do with Lyco? Why did they have to kill him?!
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:The Pike System was completely abandoned after the 1983 Geneva Convention, while the OGAS Support System was sealed away as top secret. +Why do you think Sangvis Ferri would use OGAS' base protocol as a control basis? +How on earth did Lyco get his hands on such heavily classified technology? +Think about it. The group that was related to the Relics, that you were both involved in.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Yes...90WISH...I've already figured that out.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So you're not stupid, after all. +They didn't go after you and Lyco not only because they didn't dare throw their weight around in front of me, but also because they were probably exploiting the fact that Lyco had a disagreement with you and started taking his research in a different direction. +If my guess is correct, they secretly delivered the OGAS System into Lyco's hands, and Lyco figured out how to activate it... +But after learning the truth, he locked it down somehow so nobody else could activate it. +Then...someone got the idea that if Lyco managed to find a way, then he could do it too. +At that point, Lyco no longer had any value to them.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:At the same time, the Military needed a plausible reason to force Sangvis Ferri into disarray, which would give them a chance to recover the OGAS System... +That resulted in Operation Butterfly... +But then why didn't they recover the OGAS Support System back then?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:What if they couldn't bring it back, or it would've been pointless to seize it at the time?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:The culmination of Lyco's research... Elisa...had only just been activated at that time...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Both the Military and 90WISH were waiting for the Key to mature. +They didn't just want to activate OGAS. They needed OGAS to activate itself. And who better than a self-learning AI? +With that, your superiors would have no excuse to step in, Ange.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Tsk... I'll contact the chief right away.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Don't underestimate your leadership, dear Ange. +If I could think of it, they can think of it too. The old Mishas in your KGB didn't give Zelinsky his position just because he was good at randomly arresting demonstrators and thieves. +It's just that politics is sometimes more dangerous than bullets. They need an excuse and a catalyst.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:You mean...
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:The best way to put out a large oil fire is to create an even bigger explosion beside it.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:"Extinguishing a fire by depriving it of oxygen..." +I know that, but how should I do it? The Chief already denied me permission to carry out the bombing plan I put forward...
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:There are some things they can't do in their position. +However, brainless people such as myself are perfectly suited for use as triggermen.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Given your connections, surely the Chief wouldn't use you as a tool, right?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I really couldn't say. +They just threw the boss of a PMC in jail. Locking an arms manufacturer up with him isn't too much extra work.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:If you keep beating around the bush, I won't deflate tires for you anymore.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Yes yes yes, my dear, I'll get to the point. +What I want to say is that I can provide you support, because I am a patriot.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:What can you give me?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I can give you an explosion bigger than anything you can imagine, but the price is an increased likelihood of your death.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I've already died once.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:And if you don't die, you'll be damned as a traitor for the rest of your days. That's much harder to bear than simply dying, my dear.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:...
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I accept. +I will pay any price to stop them.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Very good. Then I'll think of a way to airdrop it to you.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:What is it? +Something more powerful than an airstrike...that can be deployed via airdrop... +Don't tell me...
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Yes, that's it. +Once you get it, you can let your imagination run wild.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...If I use that, I'm pretty sure that being branded as a traitor will be the happiest ending I can hope for. +Is that what you meant by a catalyst and an excuse?
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:A perfect one, don't you think? Carter will have a hell of a time trying to explain that away.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:You...are way more devious than I imagined.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:My head swells when a young lady praises me. +Oh yes, I have another request. I'm very interested in learning how OGAS was reactivated, so do your best to bring Lyco's work back. +It would be a shame to destroy her with the Military.
NPC-Ange(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I would also like for you to bring her back. That was Lyco's final work.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏1>:I can guarantee that they will not get her. +As for bringing her back... you'd better pray for me.
