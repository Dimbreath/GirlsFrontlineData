UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:UMP45... +You've grown up at last...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:You made the right choice... +And now, you have the right to live on.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:40... Why... +Don't tell me...you've been planning all this from the start...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Haha... I don't know what you mean... +Take my dog tags. They contain what I want to say... +And take my gear too. You'll need it.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:40... +Is there...really no other way?
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:As far as I know...this is the best possible ending... +I've opened the other gates for you... There's still some time before they're locked down again... +So while we still have time...do me a favor...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What... +Hey, 40! You...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BIN>67</BIN><黑屏2>:I'm a Tactical Doll. If I must die, I want to die in battle. +Dying to a fried neural cloud...is too much of an insult... +So please...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you're asking me to kill you in your final moments...?
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:This is only the beginning, 45. +After this, you will face countless trials, and the right choices are always the ones that hurt you the most... +But if you want to live, you have to make them...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The right choices...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:That's right, just like now... +If you don't kill me, your neural cloud will be incinerated too, and all our efforts will have been for nothing.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BIN>66</BIN>:There's no time to hesitate! +What are you waiting for?!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...! +Why...why does it have to be like this?!
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:What other way is there, 45?! +Do you want to die with me so badly?!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:40, I...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Go on. The time has come to rewrite our fate.

BossDestroyerPlus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Hahaha, is that all? Is that all you've got? That volley barely gave us a scratch.
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Dammit, why do I have the feeling that she's telling the truth...
HK416(3);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hey hey, the enemy's heading my way! 416, come reinforce me!
HK416(3);UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Why...why is she so strong...? +No, if this keeps up...we have to fall back!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(4)||:If we retreat now, we'll be trapped in here!
HK416(3);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But...I can't do it anymore... +My neural cloud...can't command for that long. +Just as I thought, I can't do it by myself...
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:... +The consequences of saying such things are quite horrifying, you know.
HK416(2);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hey...what's with you guys? Even I haven't given up... +Wait...wait a minute... +Is it...game over for us?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:If 9 can't stay in command, we won't make it to the position where we can snipe Destroyer...
HK416(2);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. If only my specs were higher... +If only I were as strong as 45...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You don't have to be as strong as me. +You promised, remember? You promised you'll never be like me.
UMP45(0);UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...! +45! You're awake?!
UMP45(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Heheh, made it at the very last minute! +You may all now praise and give thanks to yours truly, the youngest genius Doll mechanic after WWIII!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Looks like we can start a new game plus, Gr G11.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ha! Didn't think you'd know that. So you've been watching me play this whole time. +Still, you're right on time, 45.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Heheh, what a touching reunion, isn't it? +Is that a tear, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Unfortunately not. It might've been if you'd been ten minutes late. +Still, can you make sense of the situation having just woken up?
HK416(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Don't worry. I already transferred a briefing on the current battlefield conditions to 45's neural cloud. +I've also found a point in the Sangvis encirclement that's ripe for a breakthrough. All you need to do is shake off Destroyer's offensive and you can evacuate without a hitch.
HK416(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>||:How's that? Kinda feels like the final showdown, doesn't it?
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uhh... It's not as flashy as it could be.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:At least we stand a chance now.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, I'm turning over the team leader authorization and temporary command module to you. +Lead us in defeating Destroyer so we can get out of here together!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Hmm...
UMP45(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:UMP45 remains silent for a while.
UMP45(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What's wrong, 45? Not gonna carry on with the battle?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:What if I want to take the time to say "thank you"?
UMP45(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Well, you just said it.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Aw, that's a colder reception than I was hoping for.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Don't raise your hopes. Let's just stick to what we're good at.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Right... I've already deployed sufficient drones to delay the S.F. attack for a while. +We'll be preparing for the next wave of attacks after this. Let's make this clear, victory's still a long way off... +We need to keep harassing Destroyer until she shows a weakness which we can exploit. When the time comes, listen for my command.
UMP45(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yep! We'll do anything you say, 45!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||<黑屏1>:... +Yeah...that's good. +Then let's survive till daybreak, and we'll all go home together!
