()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Win</BGM>:... +Perhaps one day, I'll once again recall this incredible experience – this operation to eliminate potential threats on an island. +It was fun, relaxing, and full of perils. +Gazing at the factory that we've thoroughly decimated, I give Serdyukov a verbal report of the mission and ask her to forward it to HQ.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I never thought there'd be an abandoned weapon factory from 60 years ago on this island, completely unnoticed before today.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Could be the work of some broke contractor. Not that I care.
M1903(8)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:So it's safe to say that our mission is...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've fulfilled our commissioner's request and achieved their desired results. +All that's left is to sort out our internal "problems"... +I'm talking about you two, treasure hunters R93 and P38!
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The two Dolls who are just about to quietly slip away are frozen on the spot at the mention of their names.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>257</BIN><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:... +The setting sun paints the sea in glittering gold. +I would probably have felt disappointed for a day like this to end in my childhood, but before we head home tomorrow, there is still plenty of time to wrap up this vacation nicely...
()||<SE1>AVG_Fire_Bonfire</SE1>:The Dolls return to their lively and joyous mood during the day. They set up the barbecue and tables on the beach away from the sea and put out all kinds of food and beverage they've brought from HQ – the beach party is about to begin.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who's going to eat all this? Is it necessary to prepare so much food?
()<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:There's more. We have something even more delicious after this round.
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Wow! What a feast! Here I come... Whoa!
()||:Gr G28 loses her balance and crashes into Gr G36, splashing her coconut juice everywhere.
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Ow ow ow, um...
()<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Eeeeep! +I-I'm sorry! It was an accident!
()<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Oh...she ran off. +I didn't even see who it was. Did I scare her?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It wouldn't have been so scary if you had your glasses on.
()||:The Dolls around us suddenly burst into excited whoops and cheers. +NTW-20 walks back from the sea, dragging a massive tuna behind her and attracting a large crowd.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Phew. This tuna is enough to stuff us all.
()<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Wow!
()<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Humph. +You're good, I'll give you that. But when did you catch it?
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:...While I was looking for the Commander.
()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:So your "keen vision" is only good for catching fish?!
()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oooh, that does look nice and fat! +Let's cut it up like this. I'm sure it'll taste lovely as grilled fillets.
()<Speaker>Type 95</Speaker>||:I don't think anyone has tried steaming this kind of fish, maybe we can try that. 97 might like it~
()<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:That would be a waste of a perfectly good fish...
()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Whichever the case, I'm ready to chop it to pieces!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>258</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:In the last rays of sunlight, the cheerful hubbub on the beach makes for an enviable scene from afar. +At least that's what P38 is thinking.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Feeling tempted, are we?
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hell no! +I just thought I was going to find that luck-changing treasure and my popularity will skyrocket. +But there never was any treasure here!
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's just a legend after all.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:But how come you were so sure it was real?
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Well... +Don't be like that. Think of it another way – we did get something out of this.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:S-something?
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:For example... Even though our unsanctioned actions put the Commander in danger, the Commander also believes that it led to the discovery of potential risks on the island, which made up for our mistake and saved us from being punished~
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:We aren't allowed to eat the first batch of barbecued meat! How is that not a punishment?! +And now that I think about it, I haven't been able to relax and enjoy the holiday at all because I was so busy trying to find the treasure... +What an utter failure! I'm a pathetic excuse for an idol! +Ugh...maybe I should just retire...
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:But aren't you still a trainee?
()||:The two Dolls chat about all sorts of nonsense as they stroll along the beach. As they reach the reef that the Commander walked past during the day, the chattering of the other Dolls are drowned out and they focus on the view. +The sun is halfway down the ocean and a few stars are shining softly through the twilight. +Just as P38's gaze falls onto the beach, her attention is drawn to a shimmering gleam.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Huh? That's... +R93! R93, look over there!
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:What is it? +The beach is bioluminescent! I've never seen this before.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:It-it's so pretty!
()||:P38 runs towards the sea. Every step she takes causes the sand to glow in a more intense blue. +Soon enough, even the waves are all embellished in bioluminescence. The phenomenon is all the more dazzling under a fuzzy sky where the stars are not yet on full display.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That settles it! +This will be my stage, and I'm going to give the Commander and everyone a surprise here!
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Pfft, be my guest.
()<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Humph, this time I'll surely turn things around and become a popular idol! +Hahahaha!
()||:As R93 watches P38 whooping on the glowing beach, she also stops sulking over her unsuccessful treasure hunt. +Compared to that, enjoying the beautiful view right now might just be the best treasure she can give herself.
()<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Maybe my luck isn't so bad this time...
()||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Are they actually reflecting on their mistake?
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Probably?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think the punishment was too light. It's hardly enough to make them realize what they've done wrong.
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Commander... +You're not being very persuasive with that piece of barbecued meat in your hand. +So what are you planning to do?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Humph...I'll let them off this time. +Get them back here. I don't want them to tire themselves out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:After all, the party is just starting.
