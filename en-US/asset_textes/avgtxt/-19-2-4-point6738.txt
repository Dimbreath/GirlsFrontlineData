()||<BIN>10</BIN>:【Hint】 Please read the following story tutorial carefully to ensure smooth game progression.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yep! With that, everything will be fine.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's it? Problem solved?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:What exactly...is that thing?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That, is the manifestation of El Fail's will. +In other words, her own wraith. +Through music, she tempts you to let go of your neural cloud, then take away a part of it, sealing it here forever.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Is that why we can't log off?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Yes, I'm guessing your neural clouds can't be authenticated because they're missing certain data.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Hey, don't say it as if it's none of your business.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh, sorry. Regrettably however, I've only just fully awakened, so I can't do much to help you find the missing parts of your neural clouds.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Then how do we retrieve them? +These...【selves】 that have been taken from us.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You'll have to conquer your trapped selves.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:In other words, we'll have to fight?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Be careful though – this isn't the kind of fight you're used to. +Your goal is to achieve a certain degree of synchronicity with your own selves. +That's the only way for them to recognize you and actively seek to merge with you.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Synchronicity... You mean...
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's right, this is what you've been looking forward to – a 【Performance】!
()||:【Hint】The battle ahead is different than usual ones. Please read the following guide. +First, disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand, then switch on 【Music】 in the Settings interface. +When the rhythm bar reaches the line, tap the corresponding T-Doll skill icon accurately to score a combo. +Otherwise, the T-Doll will suffer a certain amount of damage. +Victory is achieved when at least one of your T-Dolls survives the whole song. +Final reminder – please disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand and switch on 【Music】 in Settings to avoid being taken by surprise.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:I wonder which one of us is sealed here. Let's see what kind of music awaits us!
