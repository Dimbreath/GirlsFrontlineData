？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I thought...there wouldn't be any more survivors.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +So even you...want to kill me, huh...
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +I'm sure you know...your odds.

UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The only thing I know...is "what's right"...
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:UMP45 raises her weapon.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I must survive, no matter the cost!

破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏2>:... +Where...am I?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Welcome to the Eiderdown Room. This place exists between dreams and reality.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What the heck... Aren't you Dreamer? Isn't this our base? +Uh... That means...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:That's right, darling. 404 killed you again. +And they gave us the slip. We failed.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Eh? When?! Where?! My... Where's my body? +How could this be?! I remember I was super strong! And...+And I pushed them to the brink! I did it quite a few times!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Yes, you did. But you still missed the chance to wipe them out. +In the end, they latched onto a mistake you made instead... +I could only find a backup you made half an hour before your demise, so you won't remember what happened back then.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Then...what about my body?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Gone. +It was an experimental project and making another one will take a very long time. +I'm afraid you'll have to stick to your original body until then.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:... +W...Why... +It took so long...to finally get that body...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:What's wrong?
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Uuu...uuu...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:UWAAHHHHHH!!!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Why are you crying...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I'm so sorry, Dreamer! +I failed to keep my promise again! +I...I was serious this time! But why can't I win?! +I...I even had such a powerful body this time, but...but...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Even I didn't expect UMP45 to wake up. UMP45 must have a very strong backer if she could survive the attack and make it out alive. +Since they came prepared, our failure couldn't be helped...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Huh? You...you're not gonna punish me?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I'll let you off this time. The defeat wasn't entirely due to your stupidity, so I don't have the appetite for your punishment. +Besides...it's not like we came away with nothing. +No... Rather...we've gained something far more valuable than that irrelevant drone... +Heehee...Heheheheheheheh...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You're doing that creepy giggle again, Dreamer.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Say, Destroyer, do you want to know about UMP45?
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Huh? She's just a Doll that has a bit more brains. Is she that important?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:True, she's not that important to us... +But I think our guest...no...our new comrade... +Would love to hear... +The story...about their past...and our Master...
()||<BIN>55</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Meanwhile.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Ugh... +Is this...sunrise? +It's dazzling my eyes. Can I go back online?
G11(0);UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Heheh, not a chance, lazybones! +Ah, 45, have you recovered?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(3)||:I'm alright. Haven't run into any problem. +Actually...never been better.
UMP45(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>||:That's all thanks to me! I literally had to pull out every single trick I know to wake you up as fast as we could! +Well? Y'all believe me when I say I'm a genius mechanic?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Indeed, it was thanks to you. +And Sier too, for finding the safest evacuation route so we could break through the SF encirclement.
UMP45(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hehe, she'll be glad to hear that. +Unfortunately, she's in a call right now, so I'll tell her later!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:A call? I have a bad feeling about this.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:A new job's not a bad thing.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:I just want some rest. This was the most exhausting op I've been on this year...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:I wanna sleep for two days and catch up on all the movies that I didn't finish...
G11(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't ask for too much! At least we survived!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Ja... +Surviving is all that matters.
UMP45(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:You've got something to say, don't you?
UMP45(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't know what to say. +45, you had your own ulterior motive during this operation, didn't you?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:A bit, though it also took a lot of luck to pull that off?
UMP45(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Laughs bitterly) And here I thought we only do things we are confident doing. +So, you gonna make us forget everything?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Heheh, I'm hardly that scary. +It's not like it's terribly important. Right now, things are as good as they can get. +I'll tell you the whole story if I get the chance. IF I get the chance...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:UMP45 turns to leave.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sier has a message to pass on to us. Hang on.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN>:...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416, do you believe what she said?
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Humph... +Never believe a word she says unless she's giving an order.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:How about you, 416? +Will you...really be leaving? +That was you in the fragment, wasn't it?
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +I don't know, Gr G11. I'm not sure of anything.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:(Sighs) ... +You're so lame, 416...
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ja... +45 is a monster, but I'm not.
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Let's go. Our troubles are far from over... +Perhaps, they'll never be...
