M16(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：Huh? Can't I just be passing by? Can't a cute idol go on a tour to visit her fans?+And what do you mean, "a T-Doll like me"?!

M16(3);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>：Dreamer, duh!+She's been really elusive lately. No one knows where she might pop up the next second.

AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：Another masterpiece of that half-pint witch!+The thing that's blowing up Area S05 with heavy artillery!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：But this area is currently under Sangvis control, right?! What's the point in destroying their own territory?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;M16(3)||：Who knows. Maybe she's gone barking mad!

M16(3);RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Yes, M16...+You would, wouldn't you...+Because you were among those who first witnessed the use of this weapon...

RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||："Jupiter", large-scale electromagnetic tactical mortar.+Its firing range rivals that of the military's standard artillery, and it fires at such high velocity that Griffin simply has no way of defending against it.+That's Sangvis Ferri's latest weapon of mass destruction...+...And the very thing that destroyed your last hope of saving AR-15.
