M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cough... That's some heavy smoke... Hey, the Military is sending in their second and third wave of armored troops! +Where are our HOC?!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:The HOC are currently finding a suitable location to launch their attack! Firing directly on the train roof would make them obvious targets for the enemy!

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, the armored forces that just retreated have started moving towards us again.</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Return fire with our remaining cannons! +All echelons, spread out within the range of our artillery! +Defend the train until M4 unlocks the quarantine wall!

RO635(4);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What about the Commander?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:The shields are operating at full capacity; they should hold for a while.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But even so, we can't keep this up for long...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ST AR-15 gazes into the distance. The tall, impregnable wall still shows no sign of budging. +She purses her lips and concentrates once again on countering their more immediate threat. She pulls her trigger decisively.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:M4...I will do whatever I can to defend the place where you belong. +So you'd better hurry up...
