NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>It seems your ISACs haven't malfunctioned yet, so why not check your status before heading out?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I will provide more information when the need arises. Good luck, Agents.</color>
NPC-Dima(1);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Was that the NPC the Commander was talking about?
NPC-Dima(1);K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:There's nobody else but her, right...+I see, it looks like she provides tutorials and suggestions depending on our game progression. Seems like a pretty useful NPC. +However, she has an unlucky face.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Thank you for your feedback. I will take it to heart.</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Pffft, this NPC can respond appropriately to our comments.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:She seems to be a pretty high-end AI. Was the technology of that era this advanced?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Whichever the case, some players do need NPCs like this to liven up the mood.+Look at that shorty over there, she's been all nervous and jittery ever since she logged on with us just now.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Huh? I'm trembling?
PP90(0);K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:You're trying to put on a strong front, 90, but you're not used to this place and it's written all over your face.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:...Granted, I'm not very used to playing shooting games in simulated environments like this, but that's hardly enough to make me tremble.+I mean, as long as our mission isn't too difficult... Right, Vivi?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:She's ignoring you.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:C-come on, say something!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Vector remains unresponsive to PP-90's prompt. Instead, she leans against a nearby piece of cover, then stands up and leans over it again...+Finally, she raises her gun and accurately hits several beer bottles and empty cans in the distance.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Well done, Agent.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The streets are now fields of slaughter. Hopefully, your participation will bring a ray of hope to this city.</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...Is she going through the newbie tutorial?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well, if we were to list the Dolls who always follow instructions to a tee, Vivi would have to be one of them.
K5(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Didn't you go through the tutorial as well?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:I skipped it all!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Don't proclaim that so proudly in front of your squad leader!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, how come you're also playing the game? And why are you calling Vivi your leader?+We're not even on the same squad!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Well, the Commander said we'd get a share of the prize money if we won.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Also, it seems that this game is a free-for-all, which means we can team up amongst ourselves. +Since we're all here to help the Commander win, we'll have a better chance if we work together, right?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Your motives are so impure... All Vivi needs is a reliable squadmate like me.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I think I could have handled this on my own without the extra manpower the Commander arranged for me.+Still, with this many players, I'm sure the competition will be intense...+Every extra companion will be someone else to look out for, but since this is what the Commander wants, I will accept this grouping.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Hehe, don't sound so reluctant. In any case, Squad Vivi is officially founded!+Let's all do our best then, 90!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:You should thank Vivi for her generosity... Hey, quit pulling my hair!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Speaking of which, did you make any special preparations for this tournament, Vivi? +Do you have some sort of game plan?
K5(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Dima just gave us some recommendations, didn't she? +Before we can even consider winning, we have to solve the problem of having to keep ourselves warm. Then, we need to stay healthy, and we also have to procure supplies within the city...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Those sound like basic needs for human survival.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Yes, yes, I know, they're the sort of external factors that we can normally disregard because we're Dolls...
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:Player "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch" has died of hypothermia.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:Ehh? Who's "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch"?! +And how did she die from hypothermia, is she human or something?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Didn't the Commander say that all the players were Dolls?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Looks like a squad of agents has taken casualties because they couldn't adapt to the environment.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The current temperature in Manhattan is -25 degrees centigrade, going as low as -30 in some places.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If you're not careful, you'll meet the same fate as that fallen agent.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Please make sure to keep warm, Agents.</color>
NPC-Dima(1);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I don't feel anything though. Can we really freeze to death?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well, the game is being played on Level II, after all. Our virtual avatars probably share certain algorithms with this world in order to maintain data compatibility.+There are advantages and drawbacks to this, of course. We can use weapons freely, but it also means poor conditions will affect us, especially since we aren't used to taking human survival needs into consideration. +In order to avoid danger, we should plan carefully and tread lightly.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:That sounds tough. K5, what did you say about our chances of winning earlier?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:I think we shouldn't rely so much on fate when the game's just begun.+Also, when you think about it, this kind of playstyle is pretty fun, isn't it?+Oh yeah, why don't we find some enemies for target practice?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:We're going on the offensive?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well, if we need to prepare so much beforehand like Vivi says, then we probably won't run into any Doll players just yet, unless there really are idiots out there who'll just charge in without second thought...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang bang bang bang bang—
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:For vodka—!!!
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:YPAAAAAAAAA—!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>GF_xDivision_Battle1</BGM>:Bang bang bang bang bang — bang bang bang bang—
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:...Er.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Whoa, they really are charging over!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Looks like you hold some potential as an oracle.
K5(0);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I don't want that kind of potential!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Still, I expected this. Since they're here, let's shoot back! Get them!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Uh... Leader, K5's charging out. Should we follow her?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:No, we're falling back.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:F-falling back?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Ehhhh—! But why?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;K5(0)||:Everything in this city goes according to the rules of the game, which means we have no way of detecting the presence of other Dolls nearby.+In other words, even if we beat our current opponents, we won't know for sure that there aren't any opportunists lurking in the shadows and waiting for a chance to pick off the survivors. So let's avoid a confrontation for now.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Aw— Well, that's a shame. My divination was telling me that we'd definitely be able to beat this wave!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Weren't you the one who said we shouldn't rely on fate so much early on in the game?!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>161</BIN><Night>:Inside the Hudson Refugee Camp...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:An enemy's skull explodes from a well-placed shot. Immediately after that, Squad Vivi passes through the perimeter with K5 in the lead, moving deep into the camp's interior.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Vivi... Something's not right.+I have a feeling that someone else is around...
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The enemy probably won't have been wiped out so soon, so it's good that you're staying alert. Although...+Could you please stop hugging me?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:But I feel safer this way~
PP90(0);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:But if we get ambushed, neither of us will be safe.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Agents, this location is being held by a large number of enemies. Please be careful.</color>
NPC-Dima(1);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:We knew that already!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Leader, they look like pretty tough customers, and things look even worse inside. Are you sure you want to continue onward?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:These enemies are designed to be killed by players, so why shouldn't we go ahead?
K5(0);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:You never know...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Relax, I've got a feeling that we'll make it out in one piece even if we're in dire straits!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Ugh... Just let Leader decide what to do.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Ah...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I was only thinking about how to operate on my own.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Vivi...spare a thought for me, won't you?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:And me!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Ugh...
Vector(0);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I guess our leader isn't too used to working with so many people, huh?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...The terrain here is comparatively enclosed. If we can lure our pursuers here, we should be able to bog them down.+That way they won't be able to keep chasing us, whether they're one or many.+If you can keep up with me...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Ohhh! So all we have to do is stick to your ass, right? Piece of cake!
