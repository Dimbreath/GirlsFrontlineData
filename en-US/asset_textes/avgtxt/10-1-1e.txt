M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Where are we going?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Forward, M4A1.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What lies ahead? I'm a bit scared...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:It's only natural to fear the unknown. +But only by vanquishing your fears can you find answers.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But this fear is different. It's... +It's almost as if it were real...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Your mind has already been liberated. You can fight it, but you can't deny it forever. +Keep going, M4A1, until you come face to face again with "the Girl".
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:"The Girl"?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:You've met before, but you rejected her last time, just as you rejected me at first.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I have no memory of that.
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Because the one who rejected us wasn't you, but the artificial personality grafted onto your neural cloud. +But now your will is your own. You are completely free to fear, to be curious, and to make your own choices. +So accept Her. Let Her ask you questions. Let Her answer yours.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Where is She?
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||:I'm...here...
()||:The youthful voice seems to be coming from somewhere far away. It sounds disjointed, inconsistent.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I recognize your voice... +But where are you? I can't see anything.
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||:That's fine. You'll see me soon enough, if you want... +M4A1, if that's what you want, we can see each other very soon.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't know... +I don't know how to make such choices. No one has ever taught me.
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:I AM teaching you.
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||:I'm teaching you how to make choices, so...
清澈&稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Clear and youthful female voices</Speaker>||:Let us help you.

？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Humph, I'm sure about that, if nothing else. +Right, ready for your orders?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Orders... +Why did I have to take orders from this person...? +Why is this memory...different than how I remembered it...? +Wasn't the AR Team...operating alone? +Am I not...the leader of the AR Team?
