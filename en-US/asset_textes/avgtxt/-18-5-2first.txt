NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Are they still resisting? Status report.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||:Sir! The Griffin terrorists can't break through our defense line, and we've cornered our target. +Success is at hand.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Very good. Don't get careless. Press the attack.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yes, sir!

AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You finally made it!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:45's critically damaged and the others are almost out of ammo.
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sorry... Ange...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It's my fault for being so demanding... UMP9, can you lead Squad 404 in retreating back to Griffin's position?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Shouldn't be a problem!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm counting on you. What about Sangvis Ferri?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Mastermind is surrounded and their defense won't last more than a few minutes. +Can the Commander's unit continue pushing forward?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:It'll be very difficult. The Military's firepower is just too intense and Griffin forces are running out of gas...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What's the plan now, then?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We'll have Griffin draw their fire for us one last time, then Task Force DEFY and I will assault Mastermind's position...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ange! I don't want to interrupt, but Agent's signal just vanished!
士兵()<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑点2>:Captain! We've broken through Sangvis Ferri's final line of defense and successfully seized Mastermind!
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Very good. Move the package to the rendezvous point immediately.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:General, we've captured Mastermind and are preparing to move to the train station.
NPC-Yegor(2);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker><通讯框>||:Wonderful. Transport the package ASAP.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||:What about Griffin and the remaining units from the Federal Security Service?
NPC-Yegor(2);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Annihilate them. Leave no survivors.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||:Understood.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:This is Yegor. Mastermind will be transported to the train station by our autonomous units. Armored forces, change course and wipe out any remaining terrorists.
NPC-Yegor(2)<Speaker>Soldier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sir!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN><黑点2>:Ange! There's more of the military tanks! +They've turned around and are heading this way!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Tsk... Has Yegor gotten Mastermind? +This is the worst-case scenario...! + ... +... +The last resort... +In the end, it has come to this...huh...
