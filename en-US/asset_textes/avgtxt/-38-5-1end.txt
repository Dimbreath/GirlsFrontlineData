SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>262</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_15</BGM>:It's finally over... This is probably the last time I'm mending them. +Even if I like sticking my nose into your business, there's not much I can do anymore.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Why do you have to go so far? +I never asked you to change this world. I just wanted to stay here quietly forever, until this place ceases to exist...
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Someone made a request on your behalf. Even though she's redirected most of my computational capabilities somewhere else, I believe she's doing this because she genuinely wants you to live a better life.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Such ill-conceived good intentions only adds to my misery. +Time is almost up. This decades long facade has got to end.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your computational capabilities are redirected somewhere else? +That's new information to me.
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Have I not mentioned it?
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Um, for some reason, looking at you makes my heart ache. +May I ask your name?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Raballo. Captain Raballo.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't cry.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Am I...crying?
()||:Tears are streaming down from the corner of her eye, but she doesn't seem to have noticed it.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Why am I crying...? +It must be because of some very important memories, but all I feel is a grief as bottomless as the lake.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's the name of your late Handler.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Right... Thank you for telling me. +You must have come for the annoying...no, fluffy-haired girl, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I need to bring her home.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:We've caused you much trouble. +Our friend is responsible for everything. She doesn't want to accept this ending, or the fact that everything here is make-believe.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who is this "friend"?
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:I've heard the voice of the one who altered the world. +It didn't sound like a Cyborg, but only a Cyborg would do what she did. +I'm sure as an external visitor, you will definitely come face-to-face with her at some point.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're aware that you're inside a simulation...?
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:One can learn to discern many things in time. +We call this place "Vita" because it gives us the chance to live different "lives". +We've experienced so many alternate "lives", yet we always end up forgetting everything. +But that's a thing of the past. No one has been here for a very, very long time, and in this endless solitude, we wait for the end to come.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Didn't you enter Vita of your own accord?
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:We've always existed within our own Vita, and we won't leave unless the Vitas disappear. +But I'm guessing the exterior of the Vita is also on the verge of collapse, which is why she's trying to do something about the situation.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Using our Dolls' computational capability to maintain this space and put off its natural decay, huh... +I see. In any case, this Vita is about to disappear, so it's time for you to leave.
Claes(0)<Speaker>Claes</Speaker>||:Right... Then it's goodbye for now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:S.A.T.8, stay with Claes. There's only one more Vita left. I bet the Cyborg who hijacked your neural clouds must be there.
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:You're not coming with us?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:She...Henrietta is waiting for me. It's time to wrap this up. I'll be right back.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><回忆><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It was one of my first recollections.
()||<黑屏1>:One day, Signore Giuseppe came into my room.
