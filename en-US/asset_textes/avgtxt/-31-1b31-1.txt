()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Within the underground passage, the only sounds that could be heard was that of light footsteps and fabric rubbing against itself.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Can you keep up, AR-15? +I can sense your pace slowing down. Is something the matter?
AN94(4);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No, it's just that this place is getting darker and darker... I'm adjusting my night vision optics' parameters...
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:Understood. I'll slow down and wait for you. +Still, AR-15... have you noticed? +The passage here is different from the outside.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is it a matter of the construction materials? +It just feels a little different to the touch.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:This sector ought to be nothing but ancient architecture. It shouldn't be renovated, unlike the outside. +It's very likely that this deeper portion might have been preserved as a relic, and I found a lot of hidden doors that are only big enough to admit one person... +I've already recorded the positions of those hidden doors we passed. We might be able to use them in our retreat.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I've been making a note of them myself. According to the parts of the map that we've already explored, it's very likely that these hidden doors are all interlinked, forming a network of secret passages. +When you think about it, this place isn't just a maze, it's practically an anthill... Are you sure those passages won't collapse on us?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:They won't. They may be old, but their construction is solid. They were built using techniques we hardly see nowadays. +I can't see any reason why they would collapse, barring an earthquake or a large explosion from below.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Alright then, let's hope so. +Hopefully things won't get so bad that we'll have to duck into these filthy hidden passages.
