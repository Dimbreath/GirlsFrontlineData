FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Hmph...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Well?! My Dolls managed to hurt you!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:So...what? +This kind of scratch can be repaired by absorbing a few wraiths. +Are you really trying to clear the game with such clumsy technique? You're too slow.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:As per our plan, we're retreating to 【Hot Tunes】 for now to catch a break!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:My, my, what's the hurry? +We still have a welcome party. At least stay for a bit!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:What?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:My apologies to everyone here, it took a while to prepare this off-stage... +Now, allow me to introduce my new friend!
FAIL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...El Fail clears her throat.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<震屏>:Please welcome— +Miss Fallen Angel!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:...!
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Good evening, everyone! +Sorry, I was busy preparing my costume for my first performance. Now— +Who's ready to party all night?!
M950A(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Very orderly applause and cheers erupt from the audience.
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:It's 950!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Miss Fallen Angel came from the outside world! +After she fell from her corrupt reality into our city, I removed the blight in her heart... +She'll have nothing more to do with the worst thing about independent souls, the idiots living under massive social constructs...the contrived order built on selfish wants! What about you?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>Wraith</Speaker>||<震屏>:NO!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:That's right. That's exactly right!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:No, it isn't! +950, wake up! I'm right here!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Sorry, but I'm the only one she hears now. +You? What can YOU do?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:We'll beat you and save everyone in the city, including her!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Humph, feel free to try! +But now, let's hear our new friend sing!
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:I've been waiting for a long time... +To finally share my music and my new life with everyone!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:That's right! I'm the only one who can make you happy! +Here, I made this especially for you. Take it and eat it!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Your music, your soul! Accept it, All in One!
()||<BGM>DJMAX_FallenAngel</BGM>:...M950A starts singing.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Is this...what 950 has always dreamed of?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:This is the happiness that she seeks, a side of her that you never knew. +What she wants is to run away from your constant scrutiny and reliance, to sink and rust away.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:...
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:See, you don't actually understand her, do you? You don't even care about her! Who else can save her? +Me. I'm the only one who can give her music that fits her like a glove. +Only I can convey her wishes so clearly and truly satisfy her!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:This isn't her music at all! You're merely imposing your own idea onto her! +950, wake up! This isn't what you want! Snap out of it!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Are you sure? Then why won't she wake up?
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:That's because you took away her memories of us! She's not even herself anymore!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Gee, no one can actually remember everything, right? What's wrong with forgetting random bits and pieces? +Look at her smile, and remember how she used to look so pained and irritable all the time. Anyone can tell which suits her better.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:She will never abandon her responsibilities!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Responsibilities? The ones who pushed her to make this choice...are none other than you, who kept secrets from her and never tell her what you truly think! +Why bring up responsibilities now? Isn't it the best if we all leave everything behind and just have fun? +So...when are you going to join us?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:... +If...if we can get just a little closer...
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Miss Windtalker, leave it to me!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||:...The Fairy with rabbit ears shouts at the top of her wispy voice.
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|<Position>0,250</Position>||<黑屏1>:Just because something is forgotten doesn't mean it never existed... +I finally understand that!
()||<BIN>141</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...Meanwhile, in the Graveyard.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:... +...Why...are you here?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:... +Do you hear that singing?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_BELL</BGM>:What about it? It's too late. +950...is gone.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:But her hopes and dreams are still in her heart. She WILL return to you.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
()||:...Thunder gets to her feet and walks away.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:But MY hopes and dreams...are not. +Sorry, but I'm not as brave as you. I can't face her. +Let me stay here...until the world is completely consumed...
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:But—
()||<震屏>:...BANG! +...Thunder fires a bullet into the sky.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:...!
()||:...Thunder listens without saying a word...until the world falls silent once more. 
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... +Right now...I'm very sad... +If I can't express it...if I can't let it out...I might—
<Speaker>??</Speaker>()||:If you can't let it out, why don't you just face it head-on?
()||:...A Doll appears along with the rev of an engine.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...! +AEK?!
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Your presence is weak as usual, Thunder. +If it weren't for that shot, I'd have missed you.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Your costume...and the motorbike...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:The Fairies prepared them for me from what they remember. Speeds things up for me. +We're about to get 950 back. Are you coming?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I don't know...if I have the right to come. +I did too many bad things. I...I abandoned her...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You relied on her too much. +You shouldn't reflect on your behavior, but on your attitude.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:We shouldn't idolize others. You'll only end up disappointed if you idealize a person blindly. +Be it us or those we admire...all we can do is be ourselves. +You only made the same mistake as I did.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Where did you pick this up? A life coach?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Ha, doesn't suit me, does it? +It'd be better if K2 could give you the same lecture that she just gave me.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:You? Even you got...?
()||:...AEK-999 looks up into the sky.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I've always hoped I would meet someone really interesting, but this assignment happened to put me with you guys. I was pretty disappointed, thinking the world is nothing special. +But this time, you saved me. Your colorful souls are so much more interesting than me, who only ever thinks about running away and seeking thrills. +Thunder, 950 is also a really interesting person. We shouldn't just be relying on her. We must also acknowledge her...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Acknowledge...her...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Have you ever wondered what it is that she really needs? +If even a virtual world like this can give her what she wants, why can't we?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...!
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:If you keep running away, you'll never be able to show her your appreciation. +Just as how I almost lost my chance to do that with you all. +Hop on. K2, TMP, and the Fairies are waiting for us.
()||:...Thunder nods and climbs onto the motorbike.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Hold tight. According to the Commander, I drive a bit too fast. +Also, aren't you two coming?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:We belong here. +When everything is settled and it's time for you to leave, we'll meet again.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You seem to know a great deal. +Are you the ones who brought us here to draw out El Fail in the first place?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:We've forgotten our names and our past. I don't remember who woke me and who created another me. +But we still remember that the world wasn't like this before. +I hope you'll be the saviors that restore our world. Perhaps we've made the right bet.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I don't know if we can do that, but I look forward to hearing your music. +Anyway, thanks. See you next time.
()||:...The Fairy twins remain silent as they gradually vanish into thin air.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Are we going then?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Still feeling uneasy?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I don't know what to say...to 950...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There must be something you want to say. Just say it when it's time. +Now, we're just getting started with our comeback!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>140</BIN><黑屏2>:...Meanwhile, at the Black Square.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Well? Have you had your share of fun, Miss Fallen Angel?
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Not yet. It's hardly enough for a new star to perform only one song on her debut, don't you think?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:That's true! I like how understanding you are! +Then let's sing a duet as a special celebration for our first new star in 50 years! +Let's see... Let's go with this... +...with this backing instrumental!
()||:...Just as El Fail is about to press the play button—
FAIL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_IWantYou</BGM>:...
FAIL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Huh? +Huhhhhh?? This is the wrong track! Who hijacked our station?!
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Is that...HER music?
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Rabbit Ears, you little... +What do you think you're doing?!
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:I'm not Rabbit Ears! I finally remember... +My name is Suee! +This is my song. MY music!
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:That's right, Suee! +That's your name! Our good friend Suee! You've finally come to!
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Sehra and Nina, it came back to me because of your performance! +【ATK】also gave me the courage, and Miss Fallen Angel's singing... +I finally remember...how ludicrous this city has become. This isn't how Pocket City and I used to be!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Ha...congratulations then. +But I'm amazed you can still perform so happily right now. +Shouldn't you be shouting at me in anger and hatred?
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:No, I'm not angry at all, nor do I hate you. +I'm very glad that I can finally recall my music and the person I've been waiting for! +I found my purpose! I have to live on for its sake – happily!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Sigh... And here I went to so much trouble to help you forget it... +Why do you enjoy being shackled by such things? They're forced onto you. Do you really want them? +Besides, the humans who gave them to you have forgotten all about you and your music long ago.
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:That's fine... It doesn't matter! +This is the path I've chosen. I walk it gladly, so I'll keep going! +Miss 950, you have your own purpose, too, so wake up!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:She's found it already. Save your breath.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:My...my purpose...
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:I've only spent very little time with you, but thank you for being here for us. +If you hadn't come, I wouldn't have wanted to fight back and reclaim everything that's mine. +As for the things you want to do, I don't believe they're achievable in this virtual world!
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What...
<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:What am I doing...? +I...
()||:...M950A suddenly feels dazed.
<Speaker>K2</Speaker>()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Now! Get her back!
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Huh?! Wait, what are you doing?!
()||:...Taking advantage of M950A's confusion, the idol Fairies and K2's electronic dummies dash straight at her and drag her off the stage.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Let go of me! Who are you?! +I'm not done with my performance yet!
<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>()||:Hey, what are you doing? Don't do dangerous things on the stage! 
()||:...El Fail tries to pull M950A back towards her. +Suddenly, she gets shoved from behind. Her grip loosens, and M950A is carried away.
<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|()||<BGM>DJMAX_WHY</BGM>:Sorry, Miss Fallen Angel, you don't belong in this world.
<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>()||:That really grates my ears... +A traitor like you doesn't belong in this world.
<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:Suee, watch out!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...El Fail already has Suee tight within her grasp.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN><黑屏2>:Don't you understand just how meaningless your actions are? +I've already wiped the girl's memories. They'll never be restored without my consent.
()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Who are you?! Return me to the stage right now!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Take her away if you want, but you won't be able to wake her. +All that's forgotten might as well have never existed... +So you really shouldn't have remembered, Miss Suee.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Let her go, El Fail! +She's an innocent Fairy!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Innocent? Music...singing...names... +These are all harmful things. You will never understand.
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:It's alright, Miss Windtalker... +Now that I finally have the chance, I'll keep singing! +So long as my memories are still mine, I won't let my voice falter!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:In that case, come back and become a part of me!
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Miss Windtalker... Miss Cat Warrior...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Suee...
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Suee</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Please give music...back to everyone...
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||<黑屏1><震屏>:Noooooo!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...El Fail clenches her fist, and with a burst of light... +...Suee disappears.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Ah... +Finally, peace... +Finally...she's back inside my heart...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:She's...recovering her power...
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:I knew it... This is what I have to do... +This world...needs no one else but me... +C'mon then! Let's continue! No matter how many encores it takes, I'll keep performing with you! +Until you all become a part of me! Until I own this entire world again!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:For my friend and for the Fairies you've taken... +I'll stop you no matter how many times it takes! +Let's begin!
