()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The streets are filled with the sound of gunfire, running footsteps, and desperate screams. Bullets and radiation particles are billowing in the air.
()||:The garrison troops' defense line at the bottom of the quarantine wall is severely compromised and on the brink of being devoured by the endless waves of ELIDs.
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:<color=#00CCFF>This is the Garrison of Purification Tower 16! ELIDs have gathered beneath the tower in our blind spot and are attempting to scale the structure! Can somebody fire at them?!</color>

()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑点2>:The steady bursts of gunfire start thinning out over time. Wails come through the comms channel here and there...and even these are becoming more and more infrequent.
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Dammit, I'm out of ammo!
();()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:Here, my last mag! Use it well!

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This place won't hold, retreat!
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:...Are you kidding me? I'll never run off on my own and leave my fellow soldiers behind!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is this really the time to worry about your honor?! You could still make it if you leave now!
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:If you have time to talk such nonsense, why don't you get us more ammo?! The fight isn't over yet!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Why are you doing this? What good will sacrificing yourself achieve?
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:You don't understand, do you?! Our home is right behind us! +If you can't fight, then this is no place for a little girl like you!
()||<黑点1>:M4 shakes her head and leaves the garrison fort at the quarantine wall.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2>:<color=#00CCFF>...Well? Did anyone take you up on your advice?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:They...all refused to withdraw...for many different reasons.
()||:Some were trembling so violently they couldn't even speak clearly, while some hid their fear by making jokes. +Others busied themselves with scavenging for equipment from the deceased to add to their ammo reserves. +A few merely saluted M4 in silence. +Not knowing how to face them, M4 had to run away from these soldiers who were determined to fight to their dying breath.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I figured as much. The ones who wanted to run would have fled right after the first explosion.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No matter why these people are so determined to stay...they've already missed the chance to escape.</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:There's still something that I've got to do.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In the end, you're the one who can't stop obsessing over things that are none of your business.</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:After the communication with AK-12, M4 goes up to the rooftop of a building and studies the breaches on the quarantine wall from above.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Even though the situation is utterly hopeless, flashes of retaliating gunfire can still be seen occasionally from around the wall, followed by echoing gunshots.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Ange, do you read?
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Loud and clear. Go ahead.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:I...just got an idea that might put a stop to the ELIDs.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I ordered to you to fall back to the rendezvous point. Don't do anything unnecessary.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:Listen. I have the fire support platform and plenty of ammo with me. If I detonate them all at once, I could seal up the first opening on the wall.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's way too dangerous! The breach is already swarming with ELIDs!</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Besides, even if you plug the first opening, what about the second one? You only have that one case—</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:I'm sorry, Ange... But I've got to do something for them...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>177</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Just as M4 is about to turn around and set out for the quarantine wall, a searing heat starts burning in her chest.
()||:Her neural cloud feels like a boiling kettle, and there's a sharp ringing in her ears.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Groans)
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:You're too important. You shouldn't put yourself in such danger.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why...are you stopping me?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I'm surprised how much they moved you. The fact that you can still feel heartbroken means you haven't become completely heartless.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But you still haven't fulfilled your purpose.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>169</BIN><黑屏2>:<color=#00CCFF>Do you hear me, M4? M4!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Yes.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:M4 comes to her senses and nods.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Just calm down, okay?</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't be rash. Our strength is limited. Right now I need every one of you to work with me.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:But they're still fighting! The people on the wall... If we don't do something...
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We didn't have the time to assess if the quarantine wall could even withstand a third explosion after the damage it had already sustained in the first two.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I honestly won't be surprised if your trick doesn't solve the problem but brings down the entire wall instead, which is going to create an even bigger problem.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:I know...you're right. But still...
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lieutenant Dragović and his men have done their duty. There's nothing we can do to prevent their sacrifices.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's exactly why we can't let their deaths be in vain.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Their deaths will really be worthless if we give the saboteurs what they want.</color>
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Surely you don't want that, M4!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:...Right.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:M4 lets out a long sigh and her shoulders finally droop.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:I just...feel so helpless...
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The independent neural cloud that Persica has given you is a precious asset, but this isn't the time to squander it.</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I didn't want to interrupt this Chicken Soup for the Soul moment, but AR-15 just got in touch.</color>

AR15Mod(0)<通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm receiving you. Is it done, AR-15?</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry Ange, I've located the Node, but it isn't going well at all!</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Things are rapidly getting out of hand. I've sent you our location.

AR15Mod(0)<通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What a messy situation. Alright, things aren't looking too good on our end either, but we'll send reinforcements to you ASAP.</color>

NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did you hear that, M4? The fight isn't over yet. In any case, come and regroup with me quickly. We've got to aid 15 and 94 ASAP.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Roger that.
()||<黑点1>:Click.
()||<BIN>181</BIN><黑点2>:Ange looks up at the sky and sighs heavily.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>How unusual.</color>
AK12(2)<通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>I've never heard you sigh before. At least you've never done it in my presence. Now I'm curious.</color>
AK12(2)<通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I've given another order that forced her to betray her own will. I hurt her deeply again...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>You made the right call. We can't save everyone.</color>
AK12(2)<通讯框>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We can't save everyone, you say...? Sometimes I feel like we can't even save ourselves...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2>:
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...In the streets of Belgrade. +With her back to the quarantine wall, M4 continues on her course to the rendezvous point.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:It should be in this direction... Hmm?
()||:M4A1 points her muzzle at the source of a strange noise, only to find a soldier lying by the road. +The pile of ELID corpses next to him is practically a small mound.
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:(Groans)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
()||<黑点1>:M4 hurries over to the soldier's side. His protective gear is in tatters and the man is severely injured.
()||<黑点2><BIN>89</BIN>:Even so, M4 drags him off the streets into a house nearby that provides temporary shelter from the radiation storm.
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...D-do me a favor.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll do what I can. Tell me what you need.
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Make...it quick... Put a bullet...through my brain...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...I can't...
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:It hurts... My stomach and my head... These are the early symptoms of the change...
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:My fingers...are so stiff...I can't pull the trigger myself...
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||:I don't want to...turn into those monsters... I want to live...my final moments...as a human being...cough, cough!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...I understand.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:M4 lifts her weapon and aims at the wounded soldier.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:He raises his right arm slowly and laboriously to salute M4.
()||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Bang bang bang!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:You didn't tremble. You did the right thing.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I didn't...even have a choice. +All I could do was watch as everything around me got destroyed. +Failure after failure. One dead comrade after another. Yet I still... +It's no different this time. I couldn't do anything to help.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Don't blame yourself. Those people gave their lives for what they believed to be a worthy cause.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>Runstep</SE2><黑点1>:Just look at this! Was it really worth it?
()||<黑点2><BIN>159</BIN>:She flees the house and sprints through the streets of Belgrade without stopping, running past horror after horror.
()||<SE1>Alarm</SE1>:Civilians convulsing on the ground, suffering from acute radiation sickness.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Vehicles abandoned haphazardly on the road. Screams coming from deserted alleyways.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't care about my own safety. If my sacrifice could change all this, I'd gladly give my life. +And yet...
()||<黑屏1>:The voice answers in the same emotionless tone.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>177</BIN>:It doesn't work like that, and you know it.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Like those soldiers, you shared the same values and were willing to sacrifice everything.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:But you know that won't change anything, which is why you left in search of some other solution. +I'm just telling the truth. Facing the facts isn't a shameful thing.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:There is still much for you, who have just gotten the key to leave your cage, to learn about this world.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Were you telling the truth when I met Mastermind?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I was, you simply didn't fully understand my point. +Our enemies are also searching for what we're after. +If we don't hurry, the same disaster will happen a second or third time.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What exactly are we looking for? What is this "Pike" Node that Ange mentioned? Answer me.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:The Pike Node is just the beginning. We need a full picture of the black box. +If someone unworthy covets the power it brings, they will try to obtain it at the cost of everything else. +The only one who has the right to touch it is you.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:First, the whole AR Team risked their own lives for me, now so many more people have died right before my eyes. +This power has brought nothing but misery. Is it really so valuable? +I never wanted the right to touch it in the first place!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Nobody does.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:No one is born into this world of their own free will, just as no Doll has any say in regard to their own creation. +Everyone is burdened by a certain mission as they come into the world...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:But you are special. You've been given a destiny that others can't even dream of.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:There's nothing special about it. Everyone has their own curse. +Mine just happens to be especially bad.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Perhaps you haven't given this much thought because you've been living with your man-made shackles for too long. +Facing one's destiny is always painful, but it is up to each individual to find joy in this kind of pain.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:All I can tell you is that if you fulfill your destiny, you will save far more people than the ones who sacrificed themselves today. +Are you willing to suffer for the sake of ending others' pain?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...You make it sound as if I have no other choice but to suffer.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:We are a single entity, after all. +Your confusion is my confusion. +Your pain is my pain.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:And your destruction...also entails my demise. +I have already done what I could to point out the best choice for you.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>178</BIN>:After a moment of silence, M4's lips curl into a bitter smile.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:This might just be the only thing you've ever said that didn't sound like a lie.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I've been trying very hard to make you accept my existence.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Now don't get the wrong idea. I'm still very bothered by the fact that an unwelcome being has taken up residence in my neural cloud. +But...having seen all this, I finally realize that under these circumstances, I am woefully underpowered on my own. +My strength is so inadequate I can't even protect others properly.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Which is why I must borrow whatever I can. I need Task Force DEFY, the Commander, and even you to lend me your strength.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Then are you prepared to face your destiny?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Before I do that...I must first complete the assignment given by Ange. +Also, I...I'm starting to understand her urge to do unnecessary things. +In any case, it is ultimately my choice whether I decide to obey my orders or heed your advice.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll look forward to seeing the choice you make, whatever it may be.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN>:The lonely figure of a Doll flits through the deserted streets, with the wall towering behind her back.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Her gaze no longer wavers. Instead, she makes for the rendezvous point with great determination.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:It isn't over yet.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Even though the wall has been breached, brave soldiers are dying by the masses, and the storm saturated with radiation is howling like a triumphant march of victory for the enemy...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:To her, this battle is far from over.
