<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:So you abandoned your friends?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I didn't forget what you'd taught me, Jericho. +My mission is more important than my friends because...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Because T-Doll friends can be rebuilt, but a failed mission is failed. +Looks like you stick to this principle better than I do.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Someone has to keep your flair alive. And someone has to be play the villain.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:... +You have your own path to walk, Negev.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Perhaps you've pointed me to the wrong way.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Oh, I've compiled a list of what's wrong with you. +But this... +If Griffin's okay with this, then I have nothing to say.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:Then let me continue. The next part is crucial.

TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Don't worry about her. +We can only choose a side, so we're choosing the more important one.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:You're right. This is more "worth it". +Did the Commander say anything?
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:I've reported my whole plan. The Commander trusts me. +Can you handle what's inside of the factory, Tavor?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:I can only keep the gates open for three minutes. Will that be enough?
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Three minutes? That's stretching it a bit...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Well, that's your problem, my lady.
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Ha. Aren't you worried that I won't come get you?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:You said your mission is more important than your friends. Or was that a lie?
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:...Alright, I shouldn't have tried to haggle. +On my mark. Open the gates of the factory when I give the order.

NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Well? Feeling better? +Seriously, just imagine if I weren't your adjutant. +Now buckle up. It'll be bad news if we miss the chance and run into the Ringleader. +...What? I'm not afraid. Isn't it my job as your adjutant to find the best solution for you? +...That's right. We can't let all our efforts and sacrifices be in vain. Let's go!
