 ()||<BIN>3</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:...The battle is coming to an end.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Objective accomplished. I've destroyed all four of Executioner's limbs.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Seems like you've recovered quite well, Gr G11.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I'm feeling much safer with you being my meat shield.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Be grateful. You would never have received this sort of generosity in the past.
HK416(0);UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey, we're all family now, don't sweat the formalities.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(3)||:I would love to believe you if you weren't produced unconventionally.
HK416(0);UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Haha, what's the difference? Aren't we living a pretty good life?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(3)||:It's not good at all. I wanna go home...
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Just accept reality. You lost your home a long time ago...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You guys, quit chatting and help me inspect Executioner.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Hehe, with communications blocked by the jammer, we can ask questions "nicely".
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Kicks) Hey, any last words? We can pass a message to your boss for you once we move the jammer out of here.
ExcutionerElite(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:I'm afraid you won't be passing out any messages...
ExcutionerElite(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Because this whole place is rigged with explosives!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...?! Explosives?
ExcutionerElite(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:There's no escape for you! With the press of a button, Squad 404, the jammer, and everything else will be turned to dust.
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Wait a minute! Aren't you guys supposed to be protecting the jammer?!
ExcutionerElite(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's why Ouroboros is someone that does whatever she wants...
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:This was her plan all along. Hunter bought us time while explosives were placed all around the jammer.+It doesn't matter what happens along the way, because as long as you reach this point, the ending for you will be all the same...
Weaver(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Ouroboros... Why would you go along with a suicidal plan like this?
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Squad 404, do the Griffin squads in your hands have a choice when it comes to orders?
ExcutionerElite(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:When you send them to their death to accomplish a goal, will you consider their feelings?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So...we can't go home anymore?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Bitter laugh) Get on your knees and apologize, 45. I've been waiting for this for far too long.
ExcutionerElite(1)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What awaits Dolls like us is neither heaven nor hell.+Squad 404...+You will disappear from this world along with me...
 ()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1>:...At Area S06 Sangvis command center.
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Agent...+I regret to inform you that our jammer has been destroyed in the explosion just now.+Executioner placed the explosives without my authorization and she seems to have destroyed herself along with Squad 404 in the explosion.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker><通讯框>;Weaver(0)||:That jammer was instrumental in carrying out Parapluie. To exchange it for only four measly lives of ragtag T-Dolls...
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I apologize for ignoring the instabilities in the AIs of Hunter and Executioner and not being able to detect their dereliction of duty in a timely matter.+I have already dispatched teams toward the site of the explosion to confirm their deaths.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;Weaver(0)||:What is even there to confirm, Ouroboros?+Withdraw immediately. I want a detailed report, do you understand?
BOSS-8(0);Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes... Your wish is my command, Agent.
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:To all Sangvis units in Area S06...+...Expand your search area for 404 and pick up the pace.+Immediately converge on and destroy any Griffin T-Dolls found!+...Do not rely on the mech units, you must verify their deaths with your own eyes.+Nobody is leaving until Squad 404's corpses have been confirmed!
