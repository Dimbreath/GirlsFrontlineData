RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：All the Sangvis signals ahead have completely vanished. It seems like the Commander's echelons have eliminated them, so we can continue with our search now.+SOP II, what's your situation?
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Me? I'm fine. All I want is to quickly find M16...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：I understand, I feel the same way. However, we must not be reckless. After all, only the two of us can overcome the enemy's jamming.
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：The AR Team with only two people... It feels strange...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：Mmm...still not used to working alone with me?
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：No, that's not it...+Well, I'm actually not used to working with any T-Doll outside of the AR Team. Although, you're the first Doll that I feel at ease with.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Is that so... Haha, I'll take that as a compliment.
RO635(2);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I don't even know what I should do right now...+If I'm really the only one left, I would be very afraid...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：SOP II...
RO635(3);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Why? As a Tactical Doll, why am I equipped with things that have nothing to do with fighting?+Why do I have a module that simulates these kinds of feelings...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：It's okay, SOP II.+We just need to rescue M16 and wait for M4 to return, then you won't have these feelings ever again.
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Right, that's much simpler!+Give me your orders! I'll completely annihilate all the enemies in our way!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<黑屏1>：Control your emotions. Our aim isn't to eliminate the enemy.
