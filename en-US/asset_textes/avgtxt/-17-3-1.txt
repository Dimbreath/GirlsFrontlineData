NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Persica, you must stop what you're doing right now. +What you know is already too dangerous for you, and there is no need for you to know either.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:No need?! Do you have any idea how the past few years have been for me?! +Havier, I don't mind if you don't want to help me, but don't get in my way!
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I'm doing this to PROTECT you, Persica. +Did you know? Kryuger was arrested three hours ago.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Do you think I ENJOY leaving my seaside resort and my automatic race cars to get involved in these trivial matters of yours? +I don't care about whatever science freak you and Lyco birthed before this! His death even brought me an abundance of business opportunities! +But the balance has been broken now, Persica.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:The balance... What do you mean?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Everything started with the two of you, you and Lyco. Two members of 90WISH who defected but still refused to abandon their stupid research... +This was how Lyco brought disaster upon himself, but what about you, Persica? +Don't say you want to keep playing with fire! I put so much money into 16LAB. You have to take some responsibility for your work, don't you?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...Mr. Havier. +What was the objective of reactivating the OGAS System?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Why the hell are you asking me? Do I look like some old man who takes part in evil plots and schemes?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I know you know. +You once shut it down, in 2032.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><震屏>:...!
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I must say... "My god!" +That's confidential information of the highest level. Where did you learn that from?!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I have my ways. +As you can see, Mr. Havier, I'm already a criminal. I don't mind taking more risks.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:It was Ange, right? +I can't believe she would actually tell you something so classified... That's completely out of character for someone like her.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Oh, don't play dumb with me, how would a shut-in like you come into contact with top secret information? +Alright, how far have you, or rather, Ange, dug into this?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:My instincts tell me that we should be very close to the truth.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:... +This channel isn't secure enough. I'll go to 16LAB and talk to you in person.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏1>:I'll be waiting for you, Mr. Havier.
