NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander, you must be very concerned about AR-15's situation.+We are now certain that she has been planted with a malicious Sangvis program before she regrouped with the team.+We have shut down her communications module to cut off all external data transfers.+We are still screening for identifications in her program to root out the malicious codes.+Don't worry. Considering how valuable she is, we have no plans of disarming her.+Instead, we'll be using her to determine the source of her virus and prevent this from happening again.+Please rest assured and focus on completing Griffin's mission before she returns.+Thanks to you and the AR Team, we have another chance of locating Destroyer.+But just in case, we need more sources of information to confirm her coordinates.+Commander, please lead your troops into Sangvis territory to collect more information.
