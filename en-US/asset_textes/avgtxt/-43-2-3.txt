()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>301</BIN>:...+The blizzard continues ravaging the city, and the poor weather cuts visibility down to a little over five meters. If anyone were walking casually down the street, they would surely be startled by the two little heads suddenly poking out of nowhere.<下雪></下雪>
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:This is Deputy No. 7, situation normal, over!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:And this is Deputy No. 556, situation normal too, over!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:After hearing the reply, P7 looks back and reaches out, pinching the ear of the person who was using a radio to contact her while standing right beside her.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:What the heck was that for?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Do we really need to do this? +I mean, we're standing side by side, is there even a point in using the radio?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:You need to show spirit when facing a challenge!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Well, you call it "spirit", but nobody can see us from more than five meters away, right?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:...Yeah.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:We lost track of Miss Springfield and the others 10 minutes ago.+Plus, the Boss hasn't contacted us on the radio yet. I wonder what they're up to?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:M-maybe she brought the rookie to another place.+If we can get back to that library, we should be able to see where they went.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:But we're getting further and further away according to the map...
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:We would've got there by now if we hadn't run into enemies three times in a row.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Too bad the map doesn't show enemy positions...+Ah, we're at a junction again. We chose to go right at the last fork in the road and ended up going in a big circle. What about now?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:We go left, of course.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:...If only I could bring Chopsticks here. He'd help us find a better route.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:But it's not that bad, right? At least, we haven't run into any more enemies so far.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)||:But we've wasted a lot of time outside. That is to say, we might have missed out on a lot of fun stuff while we were lost!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:... +You know, even without the Boss around, you can still turn your music on whenever you want, and we can do as much "work" as we can manage.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ART556 points in the direction where they're headed. They can vaguely make out someone forging ahead through the storm.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Oho, is that a straggler I see?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I'm not too sure if it's an enemy or not, but we should be able to deal with them easily if there's only one of them, right?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Alright, let's hurry and make our move! I'm sure they've got something delicious on them!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:There's no doubt about it, then...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Time to play cat and mouse, heeheehee!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Ka-click.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two "police" Dolls exchange a glance and grin at each other before pulling out their trusty grenades and bombs. Backed by their theme song, they bear down on their target...
