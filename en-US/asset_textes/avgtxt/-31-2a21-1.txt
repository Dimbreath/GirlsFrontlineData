NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I remember telling you not to say anything unnecessary again.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:... +There's been another breach on the quarantine wall. We're currently trying to keep things under control.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your mission is to gather intelligence on the Pike Node, not damage control.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:If the situation gets any worse, we won't be able to do any recon work. +Even if we aren't getting any support, at least give me something to work with? How are things on the other end?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You mean with Griffin?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Yes. +What is the Commander's mission?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Commander is in charge of the Union Chairwoman's personal safety.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Tsk...you've got guts to have so much faith in them. +I also remember telling you not to drag that Commander into this mess.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What a coincidence. It's quite rare that we share the same opinion.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, the Commander's involvement is essential.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Are you so ready to entrust the mission to an "outsider"?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you trying to protect the Commander?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:...I didn't say that.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Even if the Commander is an outsider, at least Griffin can keep their last spark alight by working with us.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...So, do you still want to put a stop to this?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Griffin's state has nothing to do with me.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Really? I thought you were quite attached because of the time you spent there.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>By the way, we lost all our agents in the last operation.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The Griffin Commander is now the only force we can rely on in battle.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:... +I believe the Commander is fully capable of completing the mission...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's as you just said. The retreat has been going smoothly.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Right, if that's all the information you need, can you get on with your mission now?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
