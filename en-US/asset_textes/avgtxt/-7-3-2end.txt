()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><BIN>3</BIN><Night><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Battle concluded. Architect severely weakened again.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Humph... +Finally, a hit that actually feels stronger than an itch... +But you only pulled that off by being sneaky, right?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:At least this time...we made you admit you're struggling. +Even you'd find it taxing to handle two separate forces, one just causing nuisance and the other actually doing the infiltration.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:However...this isn't enough to pin me down... +My ability to recuperate...far surpasses the speed of your reinforcement. +Not to mention you still have to dedicate resources to searching for the AI core, which makes it impossible for you!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Are you sure? +We don't actually need to find it...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:All we have to do...is destroy everything.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:...BOOM! +A chain of explosions can be heard from underneath the command post.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:...!! +What...what have you done?!
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4A1! Detonation successful! +The explosion will reach ground level in about three minutes!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +How...how come there's another echelon?!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Have you caught on, Architect? +The two echelons you were fighting against are both baits. +The task force that's blowing up your base is the one with the real objective.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>41</BIN><火花>:Since we don't have the resources to multitask, we're leaving that to you. +SAA, your mission is complete. Withdraw immediately. +M99 will cover you from a distance. Rendezvous with my echelon ASAP.
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker><通讯框>||:Roger that! I'm making my way to above ground!

建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Not...again... +I actually lost to you again... +This is simply... +Hehehehe...
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<震屏>:HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! +Spectacular! This is truly spectacular!! +And here I thought I'd run out of exhilarating adversaries after those pesky girls!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:Architect...?
建筑师？()<Speaker>Architect?</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...Architect? Where on earth is she? +This Doll you're talking to...is merely a random body I'm controlling... +Since my own body is still being assembled, I've been borrowing her voice... +But now...I have no need for this anymore... +Because I...have completed my resurrection...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So you...are the AI core that's been directing this battle?! +SAA, run! Get out of there now!
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I! Am! Running! +But there are so many of them! I'm still looking for a chance to break through!
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You thought you were the one in control of the fight this whole time, M4A1? +You're not the only one who planned on buying time. I've been holding back and going around in circles with you just for this moment... +So, M4A1, it's time we officially made each other's acquaintance...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who...exactly are you?!
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Me...? +I'm...merely a ghost from the past...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>51</BIN><黑屏2>:Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SP235, also known as Ouroboros. +There was a time when I was a failure who had been betrayed and humiliated... +But now, I'm a monster forged by your own hand... +Thank you for playing a part in my vengeance. In return, I will tear you limb from limb, electronic nerve from electronic nerve myself... +Until your neural cloud is overloaded by the word "terror". That's when I'll give you permission to die!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ouroboros... +The Sangvis Ringleader...who was destroyed in a clandestine night op...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Miss M4A1, I've really been enjoying your performance. +So do give me another taste. I would love to see more of your faces...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Such as...the one you'll make...when you lose another friend...
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Boom!
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Whoa! W-Where the hell did you come from?!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:SAA!!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Boom!
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:C...cough...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:A small one... Perfect for an appetizer... +Now tell me, between me and this sea of fire, which one do you find more frightening?
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:M...M4...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Or perhaps... +...Both?
