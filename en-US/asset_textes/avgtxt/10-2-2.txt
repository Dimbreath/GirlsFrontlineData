NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Just doing my job.

NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Say it.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Can we take their bodies with us? +Some T-Dolls might still have their core intact. Then they won't have to...
NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:No. +The T-Dolls can simply retrieve their neural cloud records in the factory. It's not worth wasting our resources for several minutes of memory.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:They've fulfilled their mission. You should be happy for that.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:If...I had done better...
NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:T-Dolls, including you, are manufactured to fulfil your mission. +Sacrifices are inevitable and very common on the field. +Your guilt will only cause more of your allies to fall in battle.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...
NPC-Yegor(1)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:They did their job. What about you? Do you want to stay here and die?

Clear female voice()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Because you're special. Irreplaceable.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't want to be special! I don't want others to die for me!

Clear female voice()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:No pain, no gain. +This is the price of growing up. If you stay where you are, their sacrifices will really have been for nothing.

M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:The truth is you ARE special. You can't run away from your destiny, nor do you have a choice. +If you keep avoiding the truth and being weak, you'll only lose more people who love you. +Do you want to keep running away until you're utterly alone once more?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...don't want...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:You are not the cause of their sacrifices, but your weakness certainly encourages them. +So you must grow stronger. Only then will you be able to take your fate, and everyone else's, in your own hands.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I must...grow stronger...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:You must grow stronger. +Look within yourself. Find strength and courage. +Face your mission with your new-found self-awareness, accomplish it, and be who you really are.
