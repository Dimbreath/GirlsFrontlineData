K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Just those left! They're running away!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:They know how to do that? But they don't look like sentient AI!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:They might be under someone's control.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:We can't let them go! Leave them to me!

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:"R.I.P..." I've seen that logo before... +Gee, you can barely see what's written on it through all that graffiti. Did something happen here in the past...?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Aren't you gonna kill them?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Of course I am. +Sorry, I don't care what you were...I can't let you escape. +Farewell—

AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_BELL</BGM>:...Heh. +That was close, wasn't it?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:AEK!
AEK999(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AEK-999 walks up to the two wraiths.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Here are your lost items. I found them.
AEK999(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AEK-999 holds out two tiny cheerleading pom poms.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Hey, AEK! What on earth...
AEK999(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AEK-999 gestures at M950A to keep quiet.

AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I told you I'm not a lord... +But I did promise to save you, though I was a bit late.
AEK999(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AEK-999 finally turns around.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Good evening, guys! What are y'all doing here?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:Huh? Looking for you, duh!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:AEK! Are you alright? Where on earth have you been?!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Haha, sorry if I made you worry. +These are the Fairy friends that I made a while ago. They got captured by Sangvis Ferri so I came to rescue them.
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I knew Lord Black Rider and her friends were going to save us! Thank you so much!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Black Rider? Playing cool even in a place like this?
M950A(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I was spotted biking around the Black Square. +They wanted to call me Sunset Rider or something, but I don't like that name because the song isn't my style!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:Song? Name? What...
Thunder50(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Oh? You found out about that already? +That's right, they got captured because they remembered their names.
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>;AEK999(0)||:My name is Sehra, and this is my twin sister Nina.
DJMAXSEHRA(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Not that we can tell you apart...
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Sehra is the one in pink, Nina's in blue. +Thanks for opening the Graveyard. I couldn't have saved them before their memories got wiped otherwise. +Now that I've completed my mission, let's go home.
AEK999(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Aren't you...trying to stay here?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Huh? Stay here? +Why would I want to do that?
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I told you AEK would never do something like that!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Sorry, AEK. We thought you...
K2(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Hey, am I really such an irresponsible prick to you? +And 950, don't always make a bad person outta me.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:But you lied to me, didn't you?! You even said you were accumulating human experience or something!
M950A(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Uh...well, I WAS learning. About music.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:Tsk! Of course I'd misunderstand you if you never tell me the truth!
M950A(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Still, when I was in the bar, a voice did try to tempt me to stay in this world forever. +I don't know who that was, but I rejected it!

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:That's the voice!
M950A(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You...heard it too? That's it. That's her.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:The tombstone. The tombstone is speaking... +Or something inside is...
Thunder50(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:It can't be... +Can that voice...be heard all the way in the bar?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||<BGM>DJMAX_BlackCat</BGM>:It can... +If...she's the Master of 【Pocket City】...
FAIL(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>()||:That's right, if I am...the Master of 【Pocket City】... +The question is...am I?

M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Stay close and ready your weapons!
