SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：M16...+I think...I scared M4...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：What, did you dismember a Sangvis Doll in front of her?
M16(3);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Two of them simultaneously...+M4 turned around and ran. She looked disgusted...+Why...? Neither you nor AR15 are bothered...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：We don't enjoy it either, but it seems like M4 can't tolerate it as well as we can...+I don't get it... A neural cloud like hers isn't suitable for the battlefield...
M16(3);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：M16...is there something wrong with me?...+I think frightening our leader...isn't a good thing...
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：But you can't control yourself, right?
M16(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：......
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：In our base, the humans raise many puppies. Their hobby is to chase the trucks that pass by every day.
M16(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I know, but they've never caught up before.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：What if one day, those puppies manage to catch up to the trucks. What would happen then?
M16(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I don't know...what would happen?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：A friend once told me that the puppies would bury all the trucks into the ground.
M16(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Huh——??+How can that be! How could puppies bury trucks into the ground!
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：......+What if they could? Would they do it?+SOP II, what if...they could design a puppy like that?
()||：...M16 pats SOP II's shoulder.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：That's why you shouldn't dwell on why you're like this. What's most important is understanding that it is a part of you.+Learn to accept it, and learn like it.+After all, we all like you very much. Put a little more trust in us.

M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>76</BIN>：To be honest, I never understood M16's words...+What did she even mean?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：......
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sorry, I'm rambling again.+I don't know why I can't control myself... It's like a dam bursting... I just want to let everything out...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：SOP II...
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：RO, do you like me?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Of course I do, I told you that earlier.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：When I first met M4, I wasn't sure if she liked me or not.+She was always very afraid of me. Far more afraid than everyone else combined.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：M16 said before that M4 was a very unreliable T-Doll at first.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Perhaps the unreliable one was me. And M16. And AR15...+If we were normal T-Dolls, capable and obedient, then maybe M4 wouldn't have been so troubled...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：You've already done well enough, SOP II.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Really? I don't think so... If it were someone else...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：If it were someone else, then M4 would merely be an ordinary command-type T-Doll.+On the other hand, you are the only puppy capable of catching up to trucks.+That's why only you can know what happens next...+M16 once said that the AR Team was only able to become stronger step by step, so the strength of the team must be the sum of everyone's contributions, including yours.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Is that so... Alright...I suppose...+RO, you're really good at talking.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I'm just saying what I think is true. Thanks for telling me so many stories. I'm even more determined now to bring you all back.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：RO...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Are you ready? The transmitter is fully charged.+I don't think I need to tell you this, but once I broadcast the signal, the Commander won't be the only one picking up on our position.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||<BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>：Of course I know that!
SOPII(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Keep track of your ammo. We don't have many rounds left.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||：No biggie! I still have my hands!
SOPII(0);RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Please try to do that out of my sight next time...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：No problem! Or you could always close your eyes!
(0)||：...RO laughs, and SOP II joins in on the laughter.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Very well! Then let's begin!+Right now, we are the hope of the AR Team! We'll be fine as long as we work together!
