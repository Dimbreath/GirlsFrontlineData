UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45 still isn't back yet?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Have some patience. Although I don't know what she's doing.
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Om nom nom nom... Cotton... Candy... Princess...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Gr G11 is sleeping like we're at home or something. If 45 doesn't return soon...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sorry to make you wait, ladies.+I'm back, and I've brought a friend from Griffin with me.
SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:H-hello...everyone, I'm SPP-1...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:...
HK416(0);SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:...... (Scared)
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Since when did you become kindhearted enough to look after lost children, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ever since when we needed her. Isn't that right, SPP-1?
SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm...the scout assigned to Area S06...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:Haha, so you were the one that provided us with the information on the stealth aircraft and the S.F. Ringleader earlier?
UMP9(3);SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:Yes... I originally had an elite T-Doll escorting me, but she...
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:Died or went missing, right? Another sob story.+And what is your purpose here? Why did 45 bring you back with her?
HK416(2);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Don't be mean, 416. We're lucky that she's here to help.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:(Sigh) I'm only looking out for her. If you consider what 45 put us through earlier...
HK416(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nevermind that. SPP-1 has important information for us, doesn't she?
HK416(2);SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:Y-yes... Helian contacted me earlier and said you guys are looking for the coordinates of the jammer?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:You...already know where it is?
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:Ha! We haven't been this lucky in a long time! I thought we were cursed for life!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;SPP1(0)||:Let me hug you, Goddess of Luck!
G11(0);SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No no, I'm the lucky one here.+I was on the run after being separated from my escort.+I would've been captured by the enemy if you guys did not defeat Hunter back there.
SPP1(0)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:I'll give you guys the coordinates right now. Please take note of the Ringleader that is guarding the jammer.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Executioner? Another Sangvis that AR Team had already dealt with before.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:An enemy that M4A1 had already fought before...?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:She must've gone through the same modification as Hunter! We'll need to bring more ammo...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let's move out if we're all ready. Our objective is to seize the jammer.
