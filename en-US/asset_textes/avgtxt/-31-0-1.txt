()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What scant legacies we still possess, you left behind for us. +What convictions burned in your hearts when you first sacrificed yourselves? +What did you hope to gain when you decided to surrender control over your destinies?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tell me, would you all have made the same decision if you saw how we are now?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>170</BIN>:...+Perhaps the only one lesson that we, those who remain, have learned from your sacrifices... +...Is that we will never, ever learn anything from them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Click.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange, the lurking threats are on the move.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Shall we continue surveillance?</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange? Do you read me?</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:They're moving much faster than anything Statesec planned for. +And those bureaucrats... they won't ever consider the errors in orders they gave out from behind the desk.
()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You mean you plan on using this opportunity to take the wind out of their sails?</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...+That's not the reason we came here. Nor are they the ones responsible for the choices we made. +Take 94 and link up with me. Get the team ready for action.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The transmission ends.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:M4.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm here. +What is this place? Ange, there's no need for us to be here during a surveillance operation.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:It might be unnecessary...but that doesn't mean it's meaningless. +What is this place, according to your neural cloud?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's a memorial to the fallen. There are no clues or information around here. +The world got worse and worse, even after wars upon wars. Their sacrifices were in vain.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:This memorial to the fallen of the last war is enough of an answer. +A sacrifice is the final defense of one's beliefs. They died for what they believed in. +And we, the ones who lived, have no right to assign value to the sacrifices of others.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I will not adjust my opinion in light of that.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...+...And you decided to interfere with Griffin's business with the same attitude? +You knew very well that what you did would only expose us prematurely.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...It's all for the sake of future operations.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:But if it all comes to nothing in the end, are you willing to accept the fact that everything you did was in vain?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I will not, nor is there a need to consider such a possibility.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:M4... +... +You're becoming more and more of a stranger to me.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:"Protect your friends in the AR Team no matter the cost, even if you have to sacrifice yourself." +Weren't you the one who taught me this core principle?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A bouquet of fresh flowers is laid before the memorial.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Things are different from how they used to be.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Nothing's changed. It's just that you've become weak.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Ha, you don't quite seem to know the difference. +However, you'll probably begin to understand after this operation.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Really? +Do you know what's going to happen during this operation?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:I don't, M4A1... +But it definitely won't be anything good, right?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Aren't you the optimist.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The only good thing that can come of this is that we survive. +Do your best to achieve that, then you'll understand... +The meaning of sacrifice, and everything you see before you... +...I assure you of that.
