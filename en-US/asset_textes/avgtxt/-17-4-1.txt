NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Persica, I've already told M4A1 to have her team stop what they're doing and order AK-12 and AN-94 to prepare for electronic warfare. +They'll scan and monitor the rate of network traffic through the repeater station and then send the data to me. +After that, I'll send it to you. You need to analyze it quickly and intercept them, and keep Mastermind out of the Military's hands! +...Ha, sounds weird, doesn't it? I mean, she nearly killed me a year ago.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange, are you still leaving M4A1 out there? +Wouldn't it be better to keep her by your side at a time like this?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:That's the next step of the plan. +If we can stop the Military from hacking Mastermind, we can use M4A1 to immediately draw her into a connection. +That way, we'll get our hands on Mastermind first.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:You haven't learned your lesson, have you? You always take the riskiest course of action, whether it's for yourself or your teammates.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏1>:That's why you're the scientist and I'm the soldier. +This place is totally out of control, Persica. +Any risk is worth taking for victory.
