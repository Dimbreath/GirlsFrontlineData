()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This Vita belongs to the Cyborg called Triela?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Would you like to hear about her?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's been a while so my memory needs refreshing. +What is she like?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Triela is probably the best Cyborg out of us all. Going on a mission with her is always strangely reassuring.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She sounds very capable. She must've been through a lot.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Triela once faced off an incredible assassin from the Five Republics and came out on top. +I think the assassin was called "Pinocchio"?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pinocchio, huh...
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:The battle between Triela and Pinocchio was quite the legend at the Agency. Triela even underwent special training with the GIS just to beat him. +Just thinking about that place is enough to make me shudder.
()||<黑屏1>:I access the updated database surreptitiously and I must admit that this episode in Triela's records was quite extraordinary. +My experience with the previous Vitas tells me that the story in here probably has something to do with the capture of this Pinocchio, but the train of events have been derailed by a Doll's presence. +But now that I'm kind of familiar with the drill, I know that as long as I play my part in this Vita properly, the problem will be solved.
Triela(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>84</BIN><睁眼><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Signore Hillshire.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm?
Triela(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:What should I do now?
()||:I'm inside a house with a telescope in front of me. +The girl next to me is without a doubt the Cyborg of this Vita.
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:This must be when Triela had her first run-in with Pinocchio.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're really familiar with this case, aren't you...?
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:But back then she hadn't received special training yet, so Pinocchio managed to escape.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I'll have to see if we can get him this time.
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll be able to do it. I'll cheer for you, Signore Giuseppe.
()||:Triela reports her findings to me. +We are currently tracking down an MIA agent from Public Safety, but accidentally encountered the Five Republics assassin Pinocchio. We've been scouting the area around his residence to prepare for his arrest. +To my surprise, the story in this Vita is progressing exactly as it should according to the script. +That will save me some time on re-establishing a bond with the Cyborg. +Still, I gather the anomaly will soon present itself. I also have a rough idea about how Ceno will be be involved just from the name "Pinocchio". +I just hope things will go smoothly in here. It'd be perfect if capturing Ceno will wrap up this story.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is the bug in place then, Triela?
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Yes, I planted it on the girl I just met. +She told me the guy living in the house is called "Pino".
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, that's straightforward. So he must be our target "Pinocchio".
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:This Pinocchio may be an exceptional sniper, but we're close enough to swiftly subdue him if we act now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:An exceptional sniper?
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:That's what it says on the profile given by the Agency. Didn't you read it? +That's unlike you, Signore Hillshire.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This is where it starts diverging...</color> +Sorry, I'll be more careful.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:So should we make a move?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We can't even be sure how many people are in there. This might be too much for the two of us to handle. +We should wait for backup to arrive from Florence.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:But if we don't do something soon, that girl could be in mortal danger. Or are you planning to leave her for dead then make her into a Cyborg too?
()||:I pause to ponder this. In the original script, Triela encounters Pinocchio in the basement, but she gets careless and loses the initiative. +If Ceno has substituted Pinocchio, I don't think she could overpower Triela in close-quarters combat. +It'll probably be best if I can approach Ceno first.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Alright, let's go in. +Triela, you take the roof while I sneak in from the basement. We'll seal them off from both directions.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:The basement is confined though, shouldn't I take the basement?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The structure of the basement is pretty complex; it doesn't make much of a difference for either of us. If the enemies have me cornered down there, you'll have more of an advantage attacking from above.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Well, if you insist...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, watch yourself. Don't force it if you can't handle it.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:What are you talking about, Signore Hillshire? I'm a Cyborg. I never have to "force it".
()||:Triela starts climbing up to the roof while I draw my pistol and make my way to the basement. +Things are unfolding largely according to the original script, but there are subtle changes in the details – most definitely caused by our Doll. +Though I want to get Ceno out of here right away, I must follow the rules, which means she may fight me as Pinocchio when we run into each other. +Still, I'm fairly confident that I can handle anything the Vita throws at me, and I might just stand a chance against a Doll in a one-to-one on Level II.
()||<黑屏1>:I press myself against the wall of the house and see that Triela has just flung herself onto the rooftop. +She signals that she's ready through the radio. I ask her to stand by – if I can talk Ceno into submitting, there'll be no need for Triela to jump in through the window.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>88</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_36</BGM>:
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:With the information I have from the database, I manage to break into the basement very quickly, but the room that Pinocchio is meant to be in is completely empty.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Another divergence...
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Just as my brain is processing this, I hear a sharp bang of a rifle coming from outside. +Then Triela's scream comes through the radio.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Triela!!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Signore Hillshire, I'm...I'm fine!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm so sorry. Pinocchio ambushed me on the roof...</color>

Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just a graze on my leg, but I can still move!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I was preparing to launch the assault but someone suddenly fired at me!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Judging by the gunshot, Pinocchio isn't in the house we've been monitoring!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yeah, I walked into an empty basement too. Dammit, we've been had!!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Stay where you are; I'm coming to get you!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, the rooftop is too dangerous! You'll also become Pinocchio's target up here!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Right now I'm hiding in his blind spot. I can probably distract him while you find and capture him!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do you know his location?</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If he fires again, I can probably pinpoint him.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I don't think he's too far away; I can get him to shoot again!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, you've already exposed yourself. You'll get more than just a simple graze next time.</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But we can't let Pinocchio get away! I'm a Cyborg. His reflexes are no match for mine; he just took me by surprise.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I won't let that happen again this time!</color>

()||<震屏3>:I kick open the front door on the ground floor and run in the direction that Triela pointed me in. +Triela glances at her wounded right leg. She rolls over and gets ready to fire swiftly at the window she believes Pinocchio is aiming through. +If Pinocchio is still locked onto her, he must still be in the same position. +She times her move carefully then pokes her head up for just a fraction of a second to gauge Pinocchio's location.
()||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:A bullet flies through where her head has been the moment she ducks back down.
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Phew, I really mustn't underestimate him... I would've been a goner if that had got me in the head.</color>
()||:Triela slowly crawls away on the floor. She's already determined the sniper's position; now she simply has to return fire. +It's a bit unrealistic to hit her target with just a pistol from this distance, but she's only expected to distract Pinocchio enough to create an opening for Signore Hillshire.
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Signore Hillshire, Pinocchio is in the low-rise with the blue roof to the northeast. Judging by his last shot, he's probably at the first window from the left.</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger that. I'm heading over.</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>He has incredible marksmanship so please be careful.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I will now try to distract him with a few shots. Please make your move while he's focused on me.</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I'll make sure I catch him.</color>
()||:Triela takes a deep breath , then jumps up and starts shooting at Pinocchio's window.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Surprised by Triela's sudden movement, Pinocchio doesn't fire back right way. +Triela glimpses his exact position, ducks back down, then raises her hands and empties her magazine in that direction.
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did I get him?</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:However, a bang comes from the opposite window. The shot hits Triela's pistol. +The impact knocks the damaged gun right out of Triela's hands and sends her crashing onto the ground.
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Owww!!!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Triela, are you okay?!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>|<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You bastard... Signore Hillshire gave me that gun...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Signore Hillshire, you've got to catch him!</color>

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm already in!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I just heard him fire! Are you alright?!</color>
()||:That gunshot came from above me. Pinocchio is definitely in this building.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I don't know if anyone else is in here, but I can't let the opportunity that Triela has bought me go to waste.
()||<震屏3>:I shove the door open and roll into the nearest room. The building is indeed being guarded by more enemies. +Thank goodness Triela has been drawing their attention away from me, so their guns aren't aimed at the door. +They're suddenly alerted to my presence and start stumbling downstairs to locate me. +They may be terrorists, but both their movements and awareness give away how amateurish they are. I incapacitate two of them before they can even get close.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:The remaining Five Republics members all raise their weapons in response, but their long rifles put them at a disadvantage in the confined space.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I dodge and bait them into firing, then close in on them while they're busy reloading. +By the time they realize things aren't going well and try to draw their sidearm, it's already too late. +Once I'm done with the lackeys, I insert a new magazine into my pistol and start searching for Pinocchio.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ceno! +I know you're there!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I run up the stairs onto the upper floor as the sniper is about to jump out of the window.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ceno!
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:This Pinocchio really is the T-Doll Ceno. Her rifle barrel is still smoking from a fresh shot. +The moment our eyes meet, she pulls back the bolt and an empty shell lands on the floor with a cling. +She stares at me in bemusement but seems to have no intention of raising her weapon against me. I put my hands in the air and approach her slowly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ceno, do you recognize me?
Carcano1938(0) <Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Yes, I do.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Great, so your memory hasn't been tempered with.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, that leaves S.A.T.8. We've got to find our way out of—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Before I finish, Ceno suddenly lifts her rifle and trains it on me. I dash for the nearest cover immediately.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:A bullet hits the spot where I was just standing, and Ceno uses this opportunity to jump out of the window.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_36</BGM>:Right, she's a real Pinocchio, that one... I almost forgot about that.
Triela(1)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Signore Hillshire!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Are you alright? I heard gunshots!</color>
Triela(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm fine, but Pinocchio has given me the slip! I'm just about to go after—</color>

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Dammit... The script doesn't mention anything about being surrounded by the Five Republics.
