MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||：Ah...Miss M16.+Is it safe out there?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;MK2(0)||：Yes. Where's SOP-II? Is she not with you?
M16(3);MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||：...+I'm sorry, Miss M16...+It was too horrific back then. SOP-II asked me to stay here in the shelter...+And went out there alone to deal with the situation...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;MK2(0)||：What situation?
M16(3);MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||：After the barrage... Dreamer...showed up herself...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;MK2(0)||：...?!+Dreamer... Did she attack SOP-II?

BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||：...I seem to have underestimated you, SOP-II.+Intruder did say you're a freak. Now I finally see what she meant...+I finally see how far you would go to satiate your desires.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Freak? How am I a freak?+I just want to have fun...+Hanging out with my friends at Griffin and tearing you lot apart are all ways of having fun.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||：Then that's the problem.+You know, right? Desire isn't something a T-Doll should have.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sorry, but my head isn't much good for thinking about such complicated stuff...+Just tell me who you are, and whether you'll scream when I dismember you.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||：Me...?+I'm like you. I have a tiny problem in my neural system too.+The only way to fulfill myself is to feed my desires. Beings like us can never truly be happy.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：The difference is...+You have a nice voice. Your scream must be very pleasing to the ear...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||：There's another difference between the two of us.+You gain satisfaction by inflicting physical pain - a thrilling method, no doubt, but a bit lacking in artistry...+As for me...
