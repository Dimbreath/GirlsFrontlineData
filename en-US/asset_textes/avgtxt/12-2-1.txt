NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2>:Data transfer initiated.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Banana, who has been resting peacefully in SOP-II's arms, suddenly starts kicking its stubby legs violently... +As if to escape from something terrifying.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:Banana doesn't seem too stable... Is it because of the massive file size?
RO635(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It is, after all, just an external device – its processing speed simply can't compare with that of a Doll. +Its core is probably overheating due to its low decoding efficiency. +At this rate, its circuitry might just burn up.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What?! +NOOOO! Banana... +Auuu....
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Stop crying... Even if it's kaput, we can just catch another one for you.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It won't be the same! +Not only has Banana carried your neural cloud, it was also modified by Persica. +I even gave it a paint job that matches you! +Banana is irreplaceable to me!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Thanks to that, I'm forced to relive all those bad memories every time I see it... +If you don't shut up already, I might end up destroying the Dinergate myself...
Commander()||:Dandelion, what do you propose?
RO635(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Have a Doll take over some of the decoding work from the Dinergate. +Decoding all the data is the most demanding part of the process. Once that's done, all that's left is accessing the information. +The Dinergate is more than enough to handle that.
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Understood. Leave that to me.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:No, let me do it. I do specialize in this kind of stuff. +Besides, your neural cloud is required for issuing commands and storing other neural clouds, right?
RO635(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:RO has a point. You should preserve your valuable processing capacity while we're still on standby.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So you're volunteering to save Banana, RO?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:... (Looks away silently).
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well? Why aren't you saying anything?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Also, Commander, I might be a little presumptuous here... +But there's something I believe should be done.
Commander()||:What is it?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Lunasia is storing all the backup copies of the Griffin Dolls within her own neural cloud storage. +Since I have an active connexion with her, I've been supporting her computation. +However, the amount of data really is tremendous. +So to make more space, I would like to transfer all memory fragments regarding Lunasia onto the Dinergate.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:Memories about me?
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Lunasia has been forced to make countless difficult decisions in the past, which has put her under immense pressure. +I hope you can understand her better and help ease her guilt and distress. +So I would like you to go through these memories using an external device.
Commander()||:These are M4's memories. I will not pry into them without her consent.
M4A1Mod(0);NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:This is what she desires. I am simply expressing it for her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:I don't... +...
()||:M4 looks down as if to steel herself.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(4)||:No... Actually, she's right, Commander... +Dandelion just spoke my mind for me. +I once made everyone suffer for my weakness and naivety. These memories hold nothing but indescribable pain for me. +But...even so, I still want you to know me better, Commander. +In order to avoid making the same mistakes again, I want to understand myself better too.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4, is this really okay? +After all, what happened also made you...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:It's fine, 15. Avoiding the problem will only deepen the shadow it casts. Besides, there's nothing to hide from the Commander. +RO, please go ahead and extract the relevant data. I want to express myself to the Commander and all of you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:M4...
RO635(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:She said as much. It's her decision.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:15... +Understood, I'll take care of it then.
