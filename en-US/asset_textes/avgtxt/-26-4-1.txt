()||:...In the end, I decided to have 416 launch the signal flare over the Yellow Zone.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, a signal flare over there!
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's Griffin's standard issue. The Commander really is showing us the way!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I believe it's leading us to the Yellow Zone. Your body might just make it through.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, are you feeling better?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><震屏>||:Not at all...cough... But I think I'm okay for now.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then we'd better hurry. The ELIDs will find us soon!
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But we cannot proceed yet. +A few military squads are patrolling ahead. We must first discern their patrol routes.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Can we draw the military...into fighting the ELIDs?
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It is possible. According to my observation, the military does attack the ELIDs. I believe they're too obsessed with pursuing us to care about the fact that they're firing upon their own allies and casualties. +Still, we can't exploit that too much. Otherwise, if we accidentally draw the attention of both the ELIDs and the military, we'll be heavily outnumbered.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You're right...cough... Dammit, let me think... +We...can only get closer and try to locate the mark by tracing the signal strength.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I do not recommend that. It is chaos on the battlefield. With no communications outpost nearby, we are on our own. +Finding a mark or whatever is too dangerous. I suggest we resume our course toward an area with a lower contamination index and launch a signal flare, then wait for the rescue party to find us.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's a risk worth taking. We can't handle the military with just the two of us. Ange doesn't have long.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Stop arguing... +Let me...think this over...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:No matter what you decide to do, we can't rest here. Keep moving, Ange.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Shake>||:I know...cough...
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I...I'll...make up my mind soon...
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Shake>||<黑屏1>:Cough...cough, cough!
