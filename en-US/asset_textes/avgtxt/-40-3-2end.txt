()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_War</BGM><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Gunshots echo through the forest...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:First we got ambushed while on vacation. Then I drowned because the Dolls were messing around. Now I'm in more dire straits... +Perhaps I should take Kalina's advice more seriously from now on.
()||:It's certain that the autonomous units in the previous attack originated from this abandoned factory, whose defense system is somehow still operational. I don't know if I should commend its durability or bemoan my misfortune. +Making use of an interval in the enemies' fire, I poke my head out and return fire, but such meager support probably isn't of much help to R93 and P38.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:This is so annoying! Why can't normal people be this eager to see me? +All I want is some good old popularity!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:What do you mean "good old popularity"? +Say, if you don't want to get hit, pull yourself together! We don't have that many Dummies with us, you know!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Who would've known this would happen during a treasure hunt?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, why are you two here in the first place?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Uh, we're just...trying our luck...
()||:R93's voice becomes smaller until her mumbling is completely drowned out by the enemies' gunfire. +But I heard their purpose loud and clear. It's just so ridiculous I don't know how to react.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:But you were right! +The monster guarding the treasure is really here, so we may be getting closer to the treasure, after all?
()||:Treasure?! If the enemies weren't so relentless in their attack, I would've laughed out loud.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This isn't going to work... Come with me!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Where to?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Inside the factory. +There's been no sign of movement in there so far, which means the defense system is only active along the perimeter. +Even if we can't break through their encirclement, we can't let them surround us this quickly.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:But won't that leave us with no way out?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Our objective is to buy time. The Commander is right, this is the only chance we've got!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>71</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>:R93 breaks cover and successfully destroys several autonomous units with a few well-aimed shots. Making use of this opportunity, we cover each other as we fall back towards the factory. +As we approach the building, we notice that the main entrance isn't closed tightly. There's a gap that a person can easily fit through.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're in luck! R93, cut off our pursuers! P38, with me!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Roger!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Suppressing enemy fire, we promptly slip into the factory. Just after we vacate the entrance area, a grenade explodes right where we entered the building. +The old metal door is mangled in the explosion and the original small gap is blown into a large opening that even the autonomous units can come through.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just how many of these units are stored in this factory? There's no end to them! +R93, find a high vantage point and go easy on your ammo!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Got it!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Commander, I can't keep them off anymore!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk...! +Keep moving! Head to the workshop!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN>:The enemies are pressing forward, gradually backing us into a corner. The workshop has a very simple layout, the only way out the far side is a corridor on the second floor. We run into the corridor...and find ourselves at a dead end.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Why is there a wall here?! +It's a dead end!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Dammit, my ammo isn't going to last long!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:C-Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Don't panic, let me think.
()||:It's a bit hard to get a good look behind cover, but I can see tracks covering the floor behind us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tracks...tracks...
()||:I take a closer look at that so-called "metal wall" - it's obviously a gate. There's even an inconspicuous control room next to it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Bingo, that's our way out. +R93, come and cover me!
()||:After taking a deep breath, I crawl my way to the control room beside the gate behind R93's cover and quickly take stock of the room. +The entire gate control system dates back to 60 years ago, even the computer is a piece of antique. I'm no Kalina, but I can probably still get it to work. +Paying no mind to the occasional stray bullets brushing past the wall outside, I activate the control panel, which triggers a broadcast.
()<Speaker>Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Control system activated. Self-diagnosis in progress...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Malfunction in the main generator! Malfunction in the main generator!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Switched to solar power supply system, energy reserve at 31%...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Please notify the maintenance department for prompt repair, execution code E-R-0694...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No wonder why it isn't moving. Let me see... +This opens the gate, right?
()||:I pull the most eye-catching lever on the panel, and the broadcast speaks again.
()<Speaker>Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lock disengaged...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Transport route is now clear.</color>
()||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:A yellow light flashes in the corridor outside and the gate slowly rises after a mechanical hum.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There we go!
()||:As the gate is opening, the autonomous units that have been hot on our heels suddenly halt their attack and withdraw out of the corridor, as if it's part of the gate-opening sequence.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Huh?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:They...they ran? +Way to go, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That wasn't me. +This corridor is a conveyor belt. They're probably making way for whatever is going to come through.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Whatever...is going to come through?
()||:P38 curiosity is satisfied by the third broadcast.
()<Speaker>Broadcast</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ammunition loaded...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Transport rig checkup complete...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Fire control system activated...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Starting test.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It won't be anything good.
()||:I come out from the control room and stare at the open gate with the Dolls. An eerie red light is shining from down the pitch-dark corridor. The sound of the transport rig is also coming from the same location and drawing ever closer.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:What rotten luck...
()||:R93 adjusts her sunglasses with her hand...or is she trying to take them off?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:C-Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:RUN!
