()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... +...In a certain Griffin observation post.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Listen to me, it was real!
MP41(0);hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Okay, okay. +It's not that I don't believe you, but the Commander has already given the order to withdraw from this base.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;hk23(0)||:Don't give up! +S.F. only dispatched one ringleader this time, I'm sure we can beat her as a group!
MP41(0);hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:That kinda sounds like something a small fry would say before having their butt handed to them...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;hk23(0)||:Who cares?! +The point is – this is a perfect opportunity that only comes once in a life time! +If we kill that S.F., we'll become famous in Griffin!
MP41(0);hk23(0)<Speaker>Gr MG23</Speaker>||:Sure, let's go then! +...You think I'd say that? +I'm not gonna fall for that again. You fooled me last time and even recorded how I excited I was to show the Commander. +I'm withdrawing – right now – so please take your nonsense to some other Doll. 
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑点1>:D-don't go...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑点2>:...And that's the story. +XM8, let's go kick some Sangvis butts and decimate their assault!
MP41(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:The Commander must have a reason for asking us to withdraw. +As Tactical Dolls, it is our duty to follow orders.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:But there are still a few days until the final deadline of withdrawal, if we ride the momentum and kill the Sangvis ringleader... +We might not even have have to withdraw at all, and we'll surely become talk of the town in Griffin. +"Legendary Dolls Change Griffin's Fate in Daring Sangvis Raid" – there might even be a headline like that!
MP41(0);XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Say, the Commander ordered us to withdraw out of consideration for your recklessness. We're nothing more than regular Dolls... +So stop dreaming about crazy stuff.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Nein, I'm not...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I also remember you once snitched on me for slacking off. +I might have taken the chance if it was someone trustworthy, but you...no thanks.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;XM8(0)||:Uh...you could've just done your job properly instead of slacking...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Huh, she left...
WA2000(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2>:...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:...Wait, who's that?! +That's Fräulein WA2000! She's really strong!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:But...I guess I'll just pretend I didn't see her.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:MP41, there you are!
WA2000(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker><Shake>||:Eeeep!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:You're the one who's been telling everyone that the Commander treats me to dessert in private!
WA2000(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:B-but I did see you eating ice cream outside your regular rations...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:That was a reward from the Commander for performing well! +I worked hard for it but you made it sound like the Commander and I have some kind of abnormal relationship!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<size=35>I suppose that isn't necessarily a bad thing...</size> +But you can't just go around spreading baseless rumors!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:...I-I'm sorry! +Gotta dash!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Stop right there! Don't you dare run away!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><黑点2>:...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:F-finally gave her the slip... +Who knows what would happen if she had caught me. +I knew it – it's better to ask Dolls I have dirt on. Let me look through my dossiers.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Huh? You're still here, MP41?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:...Oh?! +You're right on time. Come and have a look at these documents.
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:W-what is it...?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:Hehehe... +Last week, you smashed the Commander's memorabilia then secretly glued it back together as if nothing had happened, didn't you?
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Hahaha... +What are you talking about? I don't understand.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:Don't play dumb! I saw everything!
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Huh...?! R-really?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:These eyes of mine have recorded your crime. +Now, should I start counting off your offenses?
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Whoa, whoa, whoa... I beg you, please don't tell the Commander... +Otherwise, my spotless reputation would...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Go me, someone finally took the bait!</color> +Mm-hmm! +I can keep quiet about this, but I have a request.
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:What...do you want?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Actually, I've got this plan...
()||<黑屏2>:Once again...MP41 repeats her plan to strike back against Sangvis Ferri.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker><Shake>||:That...that's not going to work, is it?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:Don't worry, I've made very thorough preparations! +Surely you'd like to keep your reputation "spotless" in the Commander's eyes, right?
MP41(0);g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Ugh... This doesn't feel any different than committing suicide... +...Fine, you promise you won't tell the Commander if I do this with you?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;g43(0)||:Of course!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Then give me a minute. +Let me back up my neural cloud first...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sure, hurry back.
()||<黑屏2>:Once G43 is safely in the distance, MP41 leans against the wall.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Finally found a willing accomplice, but G43 is kinda weak. +Are there any other stronger Dolls? +Sigh... If only everyone is willing to team up with me... +I have this perfect plan and I've even been secretly nabbing explosives from logistics for it.
()||:MP41 sighs lightly.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:If I don't have any results to show, I'll be stuck running logistics for the rest of my life. I must—
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Huh, that Doll...?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Um, excuse me!
98k(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hmm? How may I help you?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:You're Fräulein Kar98k, aren't you?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I am.
()||:MP41 takes out a stack of dossiers out of her bag in excitement.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Let me see what I've gathered about you... +Wow, you really are an elite! +Can't believe I ran into an elite who can solo all kinds of missions on this scruffy base!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Is that so...? You flatter me.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Hmm, I suppose I am – too much, perhaps.
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Sorry, but what did you mean by that?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:I mean, repelling a high-spec Sangvis unit all by yourself, pinning down multiple Sangvis echelons simultaneously... +You were obviously exaggerating – no T-Doll can do such things on her own.
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:I totally understand – you must've completed those missions with the Commander's help. +Then you claimed you did everything single-handedly to make it sound really impressive!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...You're an interesting kid. +I'm currently occupied so if there's nothing else, please excuse me.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Uh...wait! +<color=#A9A9A9>Oh boy, I made the same mistake of exposing people to their face.</color> +I'm...I'm sorry! It was all just my personal conjecture, of course... Anyone would be doubtful if they haven't seen it happen, right? Haha...
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:It's alright, I don't really care what others think of me.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Heheh, everyone says that, but who knows? +Actually, I have this secret mission. If you come with me, I can testify to your achievements in battle!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I believe the Commander has already ordered all Dolls to withdraw from this base. +Aren't you going to prepare for departure?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:The secret mission has everything to do with the order to withdraw. +Actually, I have done some investigation and I know how Sangvis Ferri is planning to attack!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:I won't just tell anyone about this. +But since you're an elite T-Doll, I'll reluctantly let you in on my plan!
()||:MP41 shoves the report she's holding into 98k's hands. Not knowing what else to do, 98k flips through it briefly.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:... +You really are interesting... You managed to predict Sangvis Ferri's plan of attack... +Just from the observations you made while you were on logistics missions?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:That's right! I'm 100% certain Sangvis Ferri only deployed one ringleader for this assault! +On top of that, I've located this ringleader...and I've swiped some explosives in secret. +We just have to set them along the ringleader's route and detonate them! And we won't even have to withdraw!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Then do you know who this Sangvis ringleader is?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:She's called Gager, I think? I saw her from a distance once when I was running logistics. +She didn't seem too formidable for a ringleader, in any case.
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Gager is a high-ranking command-type Sangvis Doll. Your observation skills aren't too bad. +But it'll take more than that to stand a chance against a Sangvis ringleader. +Time's up, I'll see you around.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Huh? What's the rush? +Hey... What about my plan...?
()||:MP41 watches 98k's receding figure.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:...Hold on, she just said that the Commander had ordered all Dolls to withdraw, yet she's moving in S.F.'s direction. +Maybe...she's actually on the mission to destroy the ringleader...!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:MP41, I'm back. +Hmm? Isn't that Fräulein Kar?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:As if I'd let you take all the credit!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:What are you talking about?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:...There you are, G43. +That elite is trying to steal all our credit! +We've got to catch up right away!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Huh? In that direction? +Aren't there Sangvis scouts nearby?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP41 shakes her head.
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:How are we supposed to make a name for ourselves if this is enough to scare us?! If we run into any S.F., we'll just have to wipe them out!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:MP41, heading out!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh?...W-wait for me!
