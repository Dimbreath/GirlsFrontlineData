()||<BIN>2</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：Battle ends.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：The scent of the AR Team in the air. The ground littered with Sangvis remains. An empty factory with a signal transmitter inside.+What an insult if you're planning to ambush me here.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：Now!
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||：Attack! Attack! Kill her here!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：...Griffin focuses their ferocious firepower on Judge, but she remains unscathed.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：So you're firing from three different directions... Interesting.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：We can't even damage her like this!? SOP II!
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Taste this grenade!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>：...The grenade strikes Judge's weapons system.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：SOP II! Go!
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：That's a little surprise for you! We meet again, midget!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：Tch...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Oh my...first time seeing this expression on your face. Looks like you aren't having fun anymore.+If bullets can't hurt you, then I'll defeat you with my hands!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：I don't know where you're getting your confidence from, but the Mastermind does not wish for your death...so I have no need to take you seriously.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：Are you still trying to bluff in a situation like this?+Judge, you're under our control now. Surrender immediately and tell us where M16 is!+I will guarantee your safety, or at least ensure that SOP II won't touch you!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：Control? Surrender? How delusional.+I only came here because I was curious about the AR Team signal, yet it turned out to be you bunch again... What a waste of my time.+Also...it looks like the person picking me up has arrived.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：Picking you up?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：Why is it that bastard again... Doesn't Master have anyone else to send?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：Judge! Didn't you hear me? Surrender immediately!
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...Judge glances at RO.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：...She suddenly raises her left hand toward the Griffin forces.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>：...! EMP! Careful!
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Ah!
Negev()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Damn! Was she always this fast...?
()||：...The sound of a motor fills the air.
Judge()<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：Farewell, everyone.+I'll acknowledge your efforts even though you missed your target.+Hopefully you'll still have a chance to find her next time...
()||：...Judge jumps onto the transport aircraft.
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Oh my my...+...Maybe she won't be the same "her" next time...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：......!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：On the Sangvis Ferri transport aircraft.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Good work, Miss Judge.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||：Save it. You never intended to pick me up in the first place.
BossJustice(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：How could that be? This is Elisa's order.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||：Elisa's order should've only been to let the AR Team go free.
BossJustice(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Hehe, and what difference is there between the two?+Besides, Elisa really needs you right now. She personally ordered us to convene.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||：Tell me what's going on.
BossJustice(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：I'm not too sure myself, but Master Elisa said she "saw some dangerous things in the distance."
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||：Something that even Elisa would find "dangerous"...+......+No way...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Our enemies...may not be limited to just the T-Dolls of Griffin anymore.+This party...is finally getting started...
()||<BIN>2</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...Several minutes later, the Griffin T-Dolls begin to regain their consciousness.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Can you guys move?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：My body is back to normal, but my neural cloud is still hazy. The others should be up now.+If I had known that she'd be this tough, I would've taken stronger measures.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Sorry, I was too hasty.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Don't dwell on it. I haven't come across a monster like her in a long time. Not bad at all.+The other reinforcements are arriving now. I'll head over to greet them, then we'll consider our next steps.+Go return now. Someone's waiting for you.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Thanks for your help. We'll leave the perimeter to you...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...Wait. You said someone's waiting for us?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：It's nothing too important, so don't look forward to it.
()||：...Negev leaves.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...A strange person indeed.+SOP II, you fine?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Yeah...I'm doing okay... Still, Judge managed to escape us in the end...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Judge was far more formidable than we thought. It's a miracle that no one was hurt this time.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：RO, do you think...Dreamer was speaking the truth?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：......
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I thought that...as long as I worked just a little bit harder and killed just a few more Sangvis, then M16 would be able to return...+But now... Is it...+Not that simple anymore...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I don't know...+I...thought that I was prepared, that I found my direction...+But I didn't... I haven't done anything right at all...+If only someone could tell me what I must do...+Maybe I should talk to the Commander after we get back...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：......
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：What's the matter?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：......+RO, that T-Doll over there...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：......!
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：It's been a while...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>77</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>：...SOP II and Miss RO635.
()||：...For a second I thought SOP II would leap onto M4.+But she did not. She's just standing there, or perhaps some force is preventing her from moving.+I know that she's checking the Doll in front of her against the companion in her memories, just like what I'm doing...+Despite the fact that she is indeed M4A1 in the flesh. An awake M4A1, the leader of the AR Team whom I had always heard about and wanted to meet.+And so, we officially meet under such circumstances.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Miss M4A1, it's an honor to meet you...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>78</BIN>：There's nothing to be honored about. We're just variants of the same model.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：M4, are you...fine?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：I'm fine. You must've worked hard, SOP II.+Is that thing...M16's?
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：M4...sorry, M16 is...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：...I heard. Both of you have done very well, thank you.+Get in the car. We're starting an operation soon.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Operation? What operation?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：......
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：M4A1 glances at me, and I see a gaze so filled with emotions that it is narrow and ruthless.+I know those eyes. They're the vengeful eyes of those who have lost themselves, just like the occasional glimpses I caught on M16A1.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：An operation personally announced by Mr. Kryuger. An operation of the highest priority...+That is...the operation to annihilate the Mastermind.
()||：......+Episode 9 - Lost. END.
