NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：I believe we've gotten through most of the details. That bastard Havier's probably told you some unsavory things.+However, I trust that you won't be shaken by a few malicious words.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：Indeed, I have paid no mind to it. I've already instructed my subordinates to immediately begin preparations for this operation.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Good. You may have noticed as well, that there may be people planning to interfere in this operation, so the sooner we begin, the better.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：We can begin today. Our Commander will head over to the frontline together with your troops. His T-Doll echelons are already on standby there.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Very well, Yegor can give your Commander a ride on his helicopter.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：Understood. Before we leave, however, I'd like to have a few words with him alone.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：No problem. I also need to give some orders as well.

()||：...Kryuger listens to the latest report.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：I see... So the remaining members of the AR Team have gone missing as well. Commander, you must do whatever it takes to find them.+Though Havier may seem like an unreliable fellow, he's not one to talk nonsense.+I suspect that something big will happen during this operation, so I will place all available Griffin T-Dolls under your command.+Trust in your own judgment, and stay safe.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：We've said all that needs to be said. Let's go, Yegor is waiting for us outside.

NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Are you done? Captain, head out with Griffin's Commander.
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||：Yes, sir.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：General, I still have some questions for you.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Of course.
()||：...The door closes. Kryuger and Carter disappear into the crowded banquet.
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||：This way, Commander of Griffin.
