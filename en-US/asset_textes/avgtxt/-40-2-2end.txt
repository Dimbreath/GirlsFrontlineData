()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the forest, R93 and P38's treasure hunt is still in progress...
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Why would the first step of a treasure hunt be looking for a lost companion? +And how did P38 run off so fast on such uneven terrain?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Of course, walking in the forest, there is no answer to R93's questions other than birdsong and the sound of rustling trees.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:I wonder if the Commander has noticed our absence yet. +(Sighs) I really shouldn't have teased her. Such a waste of time... +Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As R93 walks on while muttering to herself, she gradually starts hearing a familiar scream. Then she sees P38 running back, looking even more terrified.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:<Size=60>R-R93!</Size>
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:<Size=60>You're so loud!</Size> +Jeez... I just teased you a little bit, you didn't have to be this scared.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Th-that's not it! Over there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P38 hides behind R93 and points in the direction she came from.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:What's over there? Did you find the treasure?!
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:N-n-n-no!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:No...? Then what is it? +Don't tell me you found a ghost?
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It's a sea monster! Th-there's a sea monster over there!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:A sea monster? That doesn't sound any scarier than a ghost.
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:This isn't a horror story! +There is an actual sea monster! For real! I just stepped on it! It was really slimy and gross!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:As if that could happen... +Hold on, if you really came across a sea monster, it might be a good omen? +Let's go check it out!
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What?! Shouldn't we go back to the others?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:It might lead us to something. +Isn't it how all legends go? Monsters guard treasures, or something like that.
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:So we have to fight it? No thanks!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Let's go and have a look. Just a look. +But I have a feeling we're in luck!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a very reluctant P38 in tow, R93 marches straight ahead. They soon arrive at the edge of the forest. +In front of them is a beach with a lot of reefs around. R93 watches as a red crab crawls past her heel and into a giant wad of seagrass. Then...the wad of seagrass twitches.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That's it! That's the monster!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:You mean this wad of seagrass?
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:That is most definitely not seagrass! +We should strike first and kill it!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:At least let me see what it is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:R93 draws a little closer to observe this "sea monster". +Looking at its size, this monster is actually bigger than R93 herself. It's not entirely covered in seagrass either. +The figure actually looks a little human.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:C-could it be an ELID?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:R93 and P38 exchange a glance, then they each pick up a rock and throw it at the figure... It doesn't react. +But as they inch a little closer, the "sea monster" suddenly extends two arms and grabs the Dolls by their ankles.
海怪？()<Speaker>Sea Monster?</Speaker>||:GUAAAAAGH!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake><Position>0,100</Position>||:Whoa!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:Aaaaah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sudden attack gives R93 and P38 no time to draw their weapons, so they resort to the most suitable countermeasure—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Combat_Hits</SE1>:Griffin CQC...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A combat technique for extremely dangerous situations where weapons are inaccessible. While it's only relied upon in emergencies, the techniques have not deteriorated in these dolls at all. +Quite fortunately, the sea monster isn't as formidable as it looks. R93 and P38's counterattack has it easily beaten.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:(Pants)
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I-is it dead?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:We didn't hit it in any fatal spots.
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:R93, um... It felt kinda strange.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:What?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Don't you think its voice just now sounded familiar?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:P38's observation puts R93 in a brief daze. +R93 compares the sea monster's voice with audio files stored in her neural cloud. Upon finding a match, her pupils start quivering and her lips twists into a stiff grin. +As if to prove her suspicion, P38 picks up a twig to lift up the seagrass... +...and reveals an unmistakably familiar human...
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:C-Commander?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P38 tosses away the twig immediately and props the Commander up in her arms.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:How...how... +How did this happen?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:P38...
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake><Position>0,100</Position>||:<Size=60>Who beat you up this badly?!</Size>
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<Size=80>It was you!!!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After some emergency first-aid, the Commander seems to have recovered a little, much to R93 and P38's relief.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Thank goodness we were busy with trying to get away and didn't actually go all out. The seagrass also provided some buffer so the injuries aren't too bad.
R93(2);P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:But why was the Commander lying in such a place? +Th-there couldn't be any more dangers around, right?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Guess we'll have to find out when the Commander comes to...hmm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:R93's attention is drawn to something that got washed up next to the heap of seagrass. +It's an envelop covered in moss and barnacles. It seems to have been waterproofed, but due to the long years it spent underwater, R93 still pours out a considerable amount of sea water of the envelop. +Plus a map.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Huh, is this...?!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>;P38(2)<Position>0,100</Position>||:... +It's real! The luck-changing treasure does exist! +The scale of fortune is tipping in our favor!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:R93, your eyes are practically glowing...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P38 studies the map that R93 just unfolded. +Having been soaked in water for so long, the surface of the paper is rather blurry, but one can still make out the shape of the island... +...and the clear red star marking a spot in the center of the island.
