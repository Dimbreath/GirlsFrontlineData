WeaverElite(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:I don't dislike people who struggle to their dying breath. After all, your futile resistance is my source of happiness. +Sadly...it looks like you've reached your limit, SR-3MP.
SR3MP()<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||:Oh dear...it does seem so... +After all, we don't really...have many T-Dolls left...
WeaverElite(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Still fishing for compliments before you die?
WeaverElite(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:But really sorry to tell you that everything you do is for naught. +No matter how many units you destroy, it won't affect the overall outcome.
SR3MP()<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||:That doesn't matter... After all, my objective isn't to defeat you... +I only have to hang on...until she makes it here...
WeaverElite(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...!
()||:M4A1 appears with the sound of footsteps.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Vikhr... +As the commander, I will lower the curtains for the battle tonight in person.
SR3MP()<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||:Such an eyesore you are, M4A1... +It's precisely because you're always stealing the show that I don't like you... +But...seeing that M99 got out safely...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Smiles) ...I apologize. +This will be the last time...I interrupt...
WeaverElite(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:M4A1, you actually...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Do you have to be so surprised, Ouroboros? +I thought you've been dying to see me? I just saved you the steps in between.
WeaverElite(3)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:What a party pooper. +I thought you could've come up with some more interesting tricks. Turns out it's just gonna be a gladiators' fight...
WeaverElite(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:I show no mercy to those who ruin my good mood.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Then by all means, Ouroboros. +You're going to kill me tonight... +But before that, you'll learn to fear me first.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:... +An hour later.
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:M4A1! M4A1! +I've successfully withdrawn from the battlefield! Currently meeting up with Miss Helian!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is that so...? +That's great, M99... +Cough... We...finally won... +Now I can...answer to all those who sacrificed themselves... +And...to myself...
()||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:... +M99's sobbing comes through the transmission.
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, M4A1... +Objectively speaking, even though my location and condition make me the easier rescue target... +I still think... +Your life is worth more than ours...
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:... +M4A1 tries her best to muster a smile.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's exactly why...I must die with dignity...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:M4A1... But you'll really be gone...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:As long as someone remembers us, we won't truly die... +So...please return...with your neural cloud... +And tell everyone of what happened tonight... +Tell them... +We...won...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:M4A1... +I will bring it back... +I will tell everyone...everything that's happened here... +So... +So...please...

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:... +(Sighs) It's...still the same... +Why is she so hell-bent on sacrificing herself...? +... +Or...is this what she truly wants?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Is the simulation over, Miss Persica?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Yeah...just done. +I added in some...unrealistic conditions in this simulation. +But the result...was pretty much the same as the last 69 attempts.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Then let's leave it for now. +The expenses for this kind of simulation are rather hefty.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:That's alright. Certain characteristics can already be surmised from the results. +At this rate...I'll be able to find the best solution to repairing M4A1's neural cloud.
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:I may not be a professional, but... +Is the repair to M4A1's neural cloud...really this complicated?
NPC-Helian(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Do please think bigger, Miss Source-of-Capital. +These simulations aren't just for repairing M4A1. I'm also studying the differences between the AI tech of IOP and Sangvis Ferri. +We could very well be looking...right at a new technological breakthrough...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Oh? Have you had any significant discovery?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:I've been looking into the Sangvis command network systematically this time. +Unlike our mesh-shaped dummy network, Sangvis command authorization is spread down in a tree-shaped structure. +It's not as flexible as ours, but the combat efficiency is much higher.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:I've heard about that, but our T-Dolls can't adopt a network like that, can they?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Again, think bigger, Miss Academicism.+Our T-Dolls can't, but we can use it for something else.
NPC-Helian(3)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:Uh...so what's the big idea?
NPC-Helian(3);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Remember I told you about the drone tech development that was terminated in 90WISH? +Looks like now is the time to restart it.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:...I see. I'll report this to Mr. Kryuger. +Still, exciting as the new tech may be, M4A1...
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:M4A1 is like my child. I will not give up on her. +But I've also said that the AR Team is precious and invaluable. +Please stop sending them on overly dangerous missions.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:I'm sorry, but emergencies kept coming up... +The enemy they were up against in the last battle was quite possibly Mastermind herself.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Then do you know...why Mastermind made M4A1 her target?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:I'm not entirely sure, but she...does seem to have an unusual interest in M4A1.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:... +...Lyco.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Hmm?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:The girl...is doing this because of Lycoris.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||<黑屏1>:...Lycoris?
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She...wants to find answers... +For her father.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:Meanwhile, in a secret surveillance room in a certain Griffin area. +...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:My... +We finally meet again, Miss Ouroboros. +The way you are now... Heheh...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +...Architect. +If you're here just to jeer, I'll be hibernating.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Haha, nah! We all have our rock bottoms. I get that! +And you don't have to be too dejected. +Though nothing but your AI remains, if you behave, Griffin might just do you a favor.
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +They're only using me to get what they want.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Persica said that your AI core was in charge of directing S.F.'s movements in the last simulation... +You provided your environmental construction and Sangvis command modules, as well as the combat data of some of our former allies... +Sounds pretty interesting. Even I had a part in the last mission, didn't I?
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +If you were half as good as you were in my simulation, Griffin wouldn't be turning their eyes on me now.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Dear me... That's too bad, but I really don't want to work for Sangvis Ferri anymore.
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:What on earth is wrong with your neural cloud, Architect...? +If you had let on your thoughts back when you were with S.F., Agent wouldn't have let you off.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You're completely right, which is why I switched sides. +Now you, Ouroboros, have spilled all of S.F.'s precious tech to Griffin... +Even if you make it back, what do you think Agent would do to you?
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I surrendered to Griffin, not because I like them, but because I like myself. +What about you, Ouroboros? Do you like yourself?
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:...What are you talking about? +Why does that...matter?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:You just asked me what's wrong with my neural cloud. +Well, here's the problem. I only want to do what I want. +So strictly speaking, I...am more like a Sangvis Doll than any of you.
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +And what do YOU know...about Sangvis Ferri...?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:More than you do, Ouroboros. +Have you heard of... +The name...Lycoris?
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:... +What's so important...about this name?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Let me tell you, Ouroboros... +So long as this name still exists... +We...won't achieve true freedom...
