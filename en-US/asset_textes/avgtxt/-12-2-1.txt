HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Just making sure if you're still there. You keep staring into space. I was just afraid you're lost in Cyber Wonderland forever.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I'm just a bit tired. And do I look like an addict...? +"Everything in cyberspace is fictitious; the breath and pulsation of life is what matters most."
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:You sleep like a corpse every day. You're one to talk about life.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:That's what it means to enjoy life, 416. +What good is there in running around all day and get exhausted like you?

HK416(2);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't sleep all the time, 416.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Really now. So you actually...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I don't have time for this.+(Mutters) What am I doing expecting anything out of this idiot...
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What? Did you say something, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||<黑屏1>:It's nothing important. Get ready for combat. The echelons are going to clear a path for us soon.+We'll gather as many neural fragments as we can and then get the hell out of this damn place.
