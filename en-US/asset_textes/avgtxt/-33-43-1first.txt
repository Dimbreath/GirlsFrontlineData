AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What is it?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We just received reports from the other echelons. Our scouts seem to have spotted an unknown unit that emits very strong interference, possibly the signal source that initiated the forced connection.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:Is the boss finally entering the fray?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But that signal source didn't attack any of our Dolls. It just...left... I'm not sure what the unit wants to achieve.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:The interference just now didn't seem to have a specific purpose either and just disappeared all of a sudden... I still find that puzzling.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:(Signal source? Could that be the "Isomer"?) +(OGAS, you said one of the signal sources has the access clearance for the entire city. Does that unit have authorizations for the quarantine wall?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, this signal source has countless direct connections. I believe that one of those are directed to the quarantine wall.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, I'm also detecting a lot of surveillance cameras keeping track of this signal source. It seems that the true orchestrator doesn't trust it entirely.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(She's being monitored? Does that mean we're also under surveillance?!)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That is correct. Before you arrived, I only sensed a small amount of connection requests, which I assumed were this Isomer's doing.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Then after the destruction of the power plant, a massive wave of disordered connections emerged, which leads me to believe that the other connections apart from the Isomer have been under some kind of control the entire time.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(What does that mean?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Judging by the data we've acquired so far, these connections are confined within the city, and they are all restraining one another. The moment any individual tries to escape, it is hunted down by Paradeus' autonomous units.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But since it's obvious that their mutual connection doesn't have much of an effect, and that there seems to be some kind of resonance between you and these connections, it's only natural for them to come after you and try to force a connection with you.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(I don't understand... What exactly are they?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The memories transferred through the previous connection coincide with those in your neural cloud, so I believe they must have something to do with your past.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Now, are you ready to make contact with them?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(How can I be sure that you're telling the truth? You keep trying to talk me into connecting with them; what if you take control over my body while my neural cloud is connected to the Isomer?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your body means very little to me. I told you - I'm only interested in learning more about myself.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(But you have a history of not keeping your word.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It was an expedient measure that I had to take.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If it gives you some peace of mind, I can borrow your creator's trick and leave you a backdoor, so that other Dolls can enter your neural cloud and lead you out of the base layer if you find yourself stuck down there.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, I do not recommend doing this. If a Doll ventures too deep into your neural cloud, they will trigger a neural merge, which won't affect you since your neural cloud is so huge, but the Doll could disappear just like that.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(You mean...our neural clouds could merge together? Why didn't you mention this before?!)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You never asked. Besides, each Doll body is only supposed to contain a single neural cloud anyway; that's what a neural module is meant for.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Tsk... Then how come you've been able to exist within me this whole time?)
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>My processing speed is just enough to offset your assimilation attempt. This isn't something a regular Doll can do.</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...what is it now?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:An incoming call from the Commander.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Oh...right. +Commander, this is M4. Please advise.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>M4, we got in touch with Miss Persica. She...wants a word with you.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Persica?! You've finally been able to re-establish contact?

M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh...? Oh, I-I'm fine. I was under confinement for a while, but I'm quite safe for the moment.</color>

M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm the one who's glad.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I thought...you wouldn't want to talk to me. But you don't seem to resent me...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Anyway, I'm sure you've already sensed the presence of some strange signal sources in the city. They must've been trying to force a connection with you...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:!!! +(When did she notice?)
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>These signal sources bother me...</color>

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:No...it's nothing...
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, the connections are only strong enough for recon purposes at the moment, so we can't be sure what exactly you will find in this network in Tallinn...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I understand. Even if it's a trap, I should be able to get out. Don't worry, I've done this before. +I was already thinking about doing some reconnaissance, but I haven't made up my mind. If I have the Commander's permission, I'll get started at once.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We do need more information.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Order received. We will carry out the mission after some preparation. M4 out.

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As you said before, she's carrying a very heavy burden, but no one else can help her. +Let's hope she can find the answer that she seeks.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ever since her encounter with Elisa, her neural cloud hasn't been quite stable. Even though I unsealed everything in her neural cloud, it might actually have done her more harm than good...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why is that?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>I've been giving a lot of thought to the nature of the Parapluie virus... When she connects with the signal sources, Squad 404 should be able to intercept the data in there... I hope my suspicions are wrong.</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>197</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:New orders?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:A mission from Miss Persica and the Commander. They want me to connect with the unknown signal sources and gather as much information as possible.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:How is Miss Persica doing?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:She seems alright from what I could see in the call.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:That's good... But are you sure you're up for this mission? You were very much on the fence just now.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15, I've thought it through. I want to seek what I must.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:The Commander and Persica don't know what you're up against, do they? If you're still afraid...
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No...I can't dither any more...
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 mulls over what she is about to say.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Before I do it... +15, is it true that you closed all the access ports to your neural cloud because you didn't want to hear "that voice"?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||:Yes...I started hearing it after I was infected, but I would never let anyone affect my judgment.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Maybe...that's what makes you special.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's this?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:A backdoor access to my neural cloud. +You said I needed to trust you, so I've decided to do exactly that. +If I get stuck in there, will you drag me back out?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:Is there something else you're not telling me? I think you might want to at least inform Persica and the Commander...
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Just give me your answer.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:... +My answer is yes, I will.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:If I end up being trapped in my own neural cloud, you'll have to slip down to my Level III base layer... But you might get lost in there yourself; even your own neural cloud could cease to exist...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:I may have deleted my core command, yet I'm still here by your side. +I believe I've made my answer clear enough.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Even if it means you'll have to reopen your closed ports? Even if you could be lost in my Level III base layer forever?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||:M4, since when have you become so long-winded?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15... You've changed a lot.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:It's time you did too. Since you've already made up your mind, I won't try to stop you. +But if you're planning to do anything even riskier, I want you to know that we're here to help you. Not just me, but also the rest of the AR Team and everyone from Griffin. +I know there are things that you prefer to keep to yourself, but you shouldn't shoulder everything on your own. +You might be able to deal with it for a while, but doing that isn't going to solve all your problems.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:That is all I have to say; I'm sure you understand me. +That's enough chitchat. Tell me when you're ready.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Got it, I'll be right back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>198</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Meanwhile, on the other side.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:Hmm? The signal flow is changing. +Is that so...? +She took her time, but she's finally made up her mind. Looks like our real mission is finally about to begin.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The backdoor access connection that Miss Persica gave us is working. I'm detecting her neural cloud launching an external connection. We can now infiltrate Miss M4's neural cloud.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But do we have to do this...? It feels like really bad taste to snoop around in someone else's head...</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:My, my, 9... The information we're about to gather can fish for a really decent price from Miss Persica. If we don't do our job properly, should we deduct the fees for your next maintenance from your own account?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>(Grumbles)</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Besides, there must be something incredible inside her neural cloud. The guys who stabbed us in the back want it. +Whatever they are so desperate to get their hands on must be something unusual, and there's no way in hell I'm gonna let them get what they want.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmm... If you say so.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Still, is she really going to connect with those signal sources? Aren't they supposed to be very dangerous?</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It shouldn't be too hard for M4. What I need to find out can most probably be found in these connections.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I understand, 45. But I'm pulling you out at the first sign of trouble. Learning the truth is important, but not losing you means more to me.</color>
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thanks for your concern. Let's establish the connection now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BIN>199</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:UMP9 activates the command code given by Persica. +Unbeknownst to M4, UMP9 surreptitiously opens a backdoor in her firewall.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Alright, we're on her Level II. Let's see what we can find...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before she can even finish her sentence, UMP45 catches sight of who M4 is conversing with and is quite taken aback.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 isn't too bothered by the abrupt disconnection with UMP9. She merely continues to wander around M4's Level II with caution.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:As I expected, 9's processing speed still isn't able to catch up with the frequency of this place even after a neural upgrade. Still, it's for the better. She'll be safer this way.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What kind of signal sources can achieve such data density of such high frequency...? +And now that I think about it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:45's face darkens.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:M4A1... I wasn't mistaken the last time I entered her neural cloud. Just like me, she's able to operate with both the Zener Protocol and the OGAS Protocol at the same time. +What other interesting things will I be able to uncover on her...?
