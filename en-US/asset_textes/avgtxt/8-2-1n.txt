Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:A cruel joke wrought upon us by fate... I see the lorries. +These guys have stopped right here. Isn't this a perfect opportunity?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;Welrod(0)||<BIN>47</BIN>:Are you certain that's our convoy? +Couldn't they just be some random lorries...?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:The detector is getting stronger readings. It has to be them.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Looks like the Commander was right... +Thank goodness we found the cargo here.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:But don't you think... that it was just a tad bit too easy? +Wouldn't S.F. want to guard something like this much more heavily?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:How, pray tell? Wrap it up with a beautiful ribbon and then send a greeting card to Griffin? +It's nigh impossible to hide something this large. Any attempt to camouflage it is a fool's errand.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Couldn't we just destroy the cargo on the spot?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Have your rationale capacitors been fried? It's radioactive.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:So our only hope in neutralising this risk... is taking it with us.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker||<BIN>47</BIN>:... +In that case, we'll be running for quite a while, right...?
Glock17(0);AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Doesn't this place remind you of our dorms at Griffin?
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:The dorms aren't even half as scary as this place... but you're right. It somehow feels absolutely unnerving here. +Look, there hasn't been any signs of life since we got here in the form of your usual bugs and pests.
Glock17(0);AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Even animals have learned to steer clear of human creations since the war.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker||<BIN>47</BIN>:I don't know... but I just can't shake the feeling that something's not quite right...

BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>47</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Leader, I've spotted additional enemy activity from my vantage point, over.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:They've already sniffed us out? How is the enemy reacting faster than our helicopter can get here?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><BIN>47</BIN>:They certainly have. +Even worse, I've spotted hidden mortars with trajectories intersecting our exfiltration helicopter's flight path, over.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:They're getting serious.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:We're this close to accomplishing our mission... Feels like déjà vu.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:...Could you NOT bring that up right now?
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Well, it's not exactly the same as the last time where you only managed to open the vehicle door. Sending a call for our ride back wasn't even part of the equation.
IWS2000(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:So you have met your end once before under such circumstances. Thus, we shan't fall to the same mistake.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Seriously, whose side are you on, AUG...?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Yours, of course. +I'm more than happy to help you fulfill all your wishes.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Are you sure that you're not making fun of me...? You do know what it is exactly... that I wish for, right?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>47</BIN><黑点1>:Ja, so the next course of action is obvious. I await your order.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑点2>:...I've marked out the rough coordinates of the mortars that threaten our airspace. +The designated cargo will be kept out of the enemy's hands, but our mission is as good as failed if we have no way of bringing it back. +I am well aware of what a tall task this may be, but the success of this mission hinges entirely on you. +Trust in victory, and disable those mortars, over and out!
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Leave it to us. We'll get everyone home, safe and sound.
