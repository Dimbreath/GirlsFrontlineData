Hi, this is Persica...+It's an emergency, so I'm using an encrypted channel just to be safe...+16LAB has been closely monitoring the AR Team and what's befalling the detention center...+This isn't just a random attack. There is an ulterior motive...+So...I've dispatched a T-Doll to aid you...+I'm leaving the rest to you, RO...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：Greetings, Commander. I'm a Tactical Doll newly developed by 16LAB, designation RO635.+Long story short, Commander, I have important information to relay.+A Sangvis ringleader has set up a communication outpost in the northeastern valley. I'm sending you its coordinates. Please destroy it as soon as possible.+That will prevent the enemy from getting reinforcements and expediate my arrival.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||：Is your source credible? You're new to Area S05 yourself, aren't you?+Not to mention you're a completely green rookie...

RO635(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||：What do you think, Commander?+...+I do agree that Miss Persica won't have us take unnecessary risks.+It's not a good idea to keep up this impasse either. Let's give it a shot while we can still afford to divert our forces!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Thank you for your trust, Commander.+Now please deploy your troops and launch an attack on these coordinates.
