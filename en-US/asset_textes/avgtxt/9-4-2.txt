()||<BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...RO finds SOP's hiding spot.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Panting)+Is this the place? This should be it according to the tracker...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：SOP II!
RO635(5);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Eh? RO? What are you doing here?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：You...!+(Sigh) You've really done it this time! Do you have any idea...!+You really scared me. If you disappeared as well...
RO635(5);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sorry, but...!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：You can't use the authorization rights I gave you to leave the team by yourself! Do you know how much effort we spent——
RO635(5);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Hang on, RO, look at this!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：What? This is...+M16's...
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>：M16's equipment case. I'm sure you recognize it.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：Of course, but what's inside it? I've asked her several times in the past but she never gave me a proper answer.
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||："Nothing good." That's what she had always said.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：How did you find it?
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Persica put a small transmitter on it, which can only be detected at close range.+This was something M16 herself requested...just in case.+She once said that M4 would probably need it more than she does in the future.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：So the reason you ran off by yourself was to search for this... You being distracted earlier...was it because you were allocating a part of your neural cloud to search for its signal?
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I'm sorry...I thought I'd be able to return before you wake up... Since it wasn't far away, I thought heading out solo might have been safer...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：So you thought that I'd slow you down?
RO635(4);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：No...that's not what I meant.+M16 once said that having emotions allow us to make better decisions.+I thought that it'd be better if you rested some more, as I'm capable of doing such a small thing by myself.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：I know that you are concerned about me, but...you should have reported this to me earlier. I wouldn't have refused to let you go.
RO635(4);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What about Helian and the Commander? It's not that I don't trust them, but they care for us too much. They wouldn't have allowed me to retrieve M16's stuff with my own two hands.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：...Retrieving it with your own two hands... Does it matter to you that much?
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：We'll be able to gain some firsthand information on M16's disappearance this way.+Look, there are bullet holes here and indications that it was dropped on its side. It was probably shot down from the air...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：......
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：There aren't any other signs of damage. It seems that at the very least, M16 was safe at the time when she sent this out.+And since she was able to send it out, it probably means that she wasn't in a dangerous area, so...I think we can relax for now.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：SOP II...+You're...unexpectedly smart today.
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：W-What is that supposed to mean!+I'm not dumb! I just have a one-track mind, that's all!
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>：I know, I know. AAT-52 once said something similar. "I'm not stupid, I'm just inefficient at multiprocessing."+Though, I'm glad that it's you, SOP II. If any other Doll tried to do the things you did today, I'm sure we wouldn't even be alive right now.+Perhaps I should update my information on the AR Team as I've always thought of you guys as unprofessional goofs...
RO635(2);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：The AR Team is certainly not as capable as the top elite T-Dolls, but we have far more autonomy.+That's why operating under M4's command allows us to achieve the full potential of our operational efficiency.+RO, if you really want to become a member of the AR Team, then you must think from our perspective and not merely follow orders from above.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：Being lectured by a serious SOP II... This is my first time seeing you like this. Sorry, for some reason I feel like laughing, haha...
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Haha, laugh if you wanna. This is what AR15 taught me back then, and I've always kept it in my mind.+Yeah... AR15... She talked about so many things, but I understood so little.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：AR15...+Yeah, I'm like that as well...+I understand too little... But...I've also learned a lot.
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Yup, everyone is a good person. That's why I like everyone so much.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Am I included in that "everyone"?
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Of course! I like you too, RO.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Heh... Even though I know what you mean, hearing it like that is a little embarrassing...
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Really? I've always talked like this.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Okay! Let's get out of here first. It'll be dangerous if we stay here for too long.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>：......!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Hold up! I've detected the signal of an advanced Sangvis T-Doll rapidly approaching in this direction!
RO635(4);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Were we discovered?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：(Sigh) Either way, it seems like it won't be easy for us to escape...
RO635(4);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Isn't this perfect, though?+I was just thinking that it'd be too boring to end the day having done nothing besides running some errands.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Ha...that's true. That's certainly more like your style, SOP II.
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Hehe, looks like you're adapting well to the team!
