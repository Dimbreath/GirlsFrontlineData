FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Bonsoir, Commander. This is Tactical Doll Five-seven, adjutant of Team FF. +As FAL has mentioned, I'll be the bait for this operation. +It's completely all right. I more or less expected it... That's just how she is. +But say, Commander...what do you think about me? +You must realize that I'm not her. My performance is much more reliable, and I never ask my subordinates to suffer needlessly. +Am I not much warmer than a cold and materialistic woman like FAL? +Heheh, so you really do like me? C'est bien! I like you a lot too, Commander!
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You're still here, 57?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Ah...I'm about to set off.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:So please escort me on my way. I'm heading to this piece of open space on the map... +Please keep me safe, okay? Don't stray too far from me even after we get there. I'll be sure to repay you handsomely~ +Bien. Let's get started while the night is still young.
