SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||:Leader, are you sure it's this way?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:The coordinates definitely point towards this place... +Ah, got it! There really are test subjects here... We have to bring them back with us.
ACR(0)<Speaker>ACR</Speaker>||:Uh... Leader, the radiation levels have been on the rise in this area and the sky is getting dark... +I don't think we can complete this mission on our own.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:These test subjects must be very important so we must preserve them. +I've already contacted the Commander. More echelons will be here soon to help us. We just have to hang in there for a while!
SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||:Leader, keep an eye on the radiation levels around us. + Even T-Dolls are affected when exposed to extremely high levels of radiation. If a radiation storm spreads towards us, we'll have to move to somewhere safe.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood. Let's move it then. Time is short.
