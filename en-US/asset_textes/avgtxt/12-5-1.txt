()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So this is my Level III base layer?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...There's nothing here. Just boundless darkness. +Will that consciousness ever let me resurface? +Perhaps staying here will finally make me happy. +It's not bad... I won't ever have to suffer again, nor will I be forced to make choices that will inevitably cause someone pain. +Perhaps what I need is a world that needs me, a world in which a part of me can be safe. +Perhaps this place, where nothing exists, is where I truly belong.
()||:M4 stood up and studied this world of nothingness. +The place was completely empty.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Nothing at all. There's no pain, but there's no joy either. +This feeling... Am I feeling lonely? +Even in a place with nothing, suffering still exists? +But I suppose it isn't so bad if no one else suffers but me.
()||:Right then, M4 realized someone seemed to be staring at her from a distance.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is somebody there? +Could it be the consciousness that called itself OGAS? +No, it feels different... It feels unfamiliar and familiar at the same time... +It's exact the same feeling...as when Mastermind tried to hack me by force...
()||:M4 approached the figure slowly and came face-to-face with a girl whom she had never seen.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who are you?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why are you here?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why do you feel so familiar to me?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you a friend?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Or are you a foe?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You won't tell me anything? +Or do you think nothing will change even if I have the answers...?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Looks like you're just like me – abandoned here. +Not allowed to do anything. Not able to do anything. +Not serving any purpose...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:...You have not been abandoned.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Huh?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Silent Girl</Speaker>||:You are the only one who has not been abandoned.
()||:The silent girl gradually faded away, leaving M4 alone once again in the darkness.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...It seemed responsive to you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Its creator must have something to do with you.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Even though it was willing to connect with you, I still couldn't access its neural cloud.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>A stronger force is holding it back.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Is it the base code? Or some kind of external influence?</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So it was you again!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What do you mean?</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That girl just now, what was she? +Were you trying to twist my mind again?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No, I've been helping you overcome your obstacle.</color>
()||<黑屏1>:The darkness gradually melted away, revealing a scene on Level II.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:<color=#00CCFF>Looks like we're in.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? +And what is this place...?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're currently in the system of an unknown enemy. I'm infiltrating their network.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They have set up a large amount of offensive firewalls, though they might as well not be there against me.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why have you freed me from the base layer?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because I found something interesting that I'd like to experience with you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I haven't been able to hack the central neural system of those unidentified units, but it's responding to your neural cloud.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's the girl you just saw... If it was even a girl.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You lost me since a moment ago. +Unidentified units? What's been going on?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We came across some threats we've never encountered before during our retreat.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>To make it safer for us to move, I'm hacking into their network.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>These unknown units operate on a seemingly complex system, but the base layer is actually quite similar to Sangvis Ferri.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What does that mean?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They also use the OGAS Protocol. Ring any bells?</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:OGAS...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>So the sudden appearance of these white units definitely have something to do with us.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I can sense a resonance that isn't so different than you. I can see that it even has some faint memory that's identical to yours.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>109</BIN>:I...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're right... I can feel it...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Only you and I could have seen that image when we were connected to Mastermind.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I found it again in these white units' base layer after I entered their system.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why would it be here...?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't know either.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, this is surely a serendipitous discovery even though we lost Mastermind.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That girl in black just now...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't you think she resembled you?</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who exactly is she?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not entirely sure.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's why we need to go further in.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Their central system is throwing up some serious resistance. I need your help to get through.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...What do you need me to do?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They have an entire army. We must upload both of our neural clouds using all the computational capacity we've got to overcome their firewalls.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But...my neural cloud can't be backed up.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's why we'll also have to transfer ourselves back into this body afterwards.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know it's very risky. If the neural transfer fails, you'll stop functioning forever.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But it's the same for me, and I'm taking the risk with you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Whether for the sake of your friends on the AR Team or for the purpose of understanding your past, you can't afford to hesitate now.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But the risks are simply too high. I don't want to do this, unless... +You promise that after this procedure, you'll give me back my body. +The AR Team...and the Commander...are all waiting for me.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>Certainly. You have my word.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>There are things I absolutely have to find out.</color>
