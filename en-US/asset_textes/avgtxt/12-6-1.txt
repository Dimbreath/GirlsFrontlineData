M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:What...what happened next?!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Stop yanking at my sleeve with so much anticipation on your face.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What's going on, RO? +Why did it just stop?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:The remaining fragments are still being processed, and your Banana is already burning up.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Banana, keep it together!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So we weren't the only ones going after Ange.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Were you also looking for Ange back then, Commander? +But Griffin should've already withdrawn from the theater, right?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We didn't. The majority of our forces did withdraw, but we and the Commander stayed behind to help Ange get out.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:That's when you got captured by the Nytos. Thank goodness you managed to escape from them in the end.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I suddenly understand how RO feels... I really don't want to relive that experience...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It took us a great deal of effort to rescue the Commander! +Then those white trash kept getting in our way, it was infuriating!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The Nytos have been growing stronger too.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I hope you won't be prejudiced against me just because of the physical appearance of this body.
NytoIsomer(4);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Alright, enough chit-chat. +Are the remaining fragments ready yet?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Still processing... But the comms among the Doll echelons outside are buzzing. There seems to be a situation.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander, the enemies are moving! I just sent you the sitrep submitted by our echelons!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it. Contact each echelon and order all combat personnel to log onto our battle channel. Distribute three basic loads of ammo to each unit. +M4.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Understood. I have linked my neural processing to the Zener Protocol.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalin, go into red alert and have all logistics personnel withdraw from the crossfire zone. +Prioritize establishing visuals for the HOC. All echelons are to withhold fire until ordered otherwise.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Roger that! +Receiving an incoming transmission from UMP45. I just patched it through to you!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go ahead.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, I do apologize for interrupting your little reunion, but I'm sure you're also aware that the Military forces are closing in on us fast.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>All other combat echelons are already in position awaiting your orders.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Squad 404, stand by on the train and wait for the AR Team to join you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Copy that.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:RO, has the Military reactivated their armored trains?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't think so. According to the sensors, all large heat sources are still stationary within Tallinn.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Their scouts may be probing us with an attack to figure out why we've stopped here. +If that's the case, we must be prepared.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're right, they don't know that we aren't moving because our train has broken down.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M4, RO, and Dandelion stay here and finish up the data processing. +SOP-II and AR-15 go and support our defenses. Meet up with 404 and join their reserve team. +Try to destroy the Military forces with as little ammo as possible.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Understood. SOP-II, come with me.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:All preparations are complete.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Great. Then we'll move all communications to the command system.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>207</BIN><Night><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Outside.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:There you are. +Just the two of you?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:M4 and RO are busy sorting out other stuff. The Commander asked us to form a reserve team together and make sure we don't get too trigger-happy.
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Save that concern for the other echelons. We 404 always bear our own operational expenses so we never waste a single shot.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's good. Then let's do a final check on our gear and ammo.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So this is Squad 404! +We finally get to fight together with the squad of mystery! I'm so excited!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh... +Haven't we worked together a long time ago...? +Back in the snowy mountains...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut up. +She has no memory of that operation.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It feels like we kept brushing each other by, but I remember 416 very well – from when we withdrew with Griffin! +We had a great time working together. Let's beat up the Military and show them who's boss just like we did last time!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Last time, huh...
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, so you've had some fun in Griffin.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:While you got blown up so badly you almost ended up in a waste recycling plant. +You only had time to withdraw because I led the other Griffin Dolls in fighting off the enemies.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Really? No wonder I have no recollection of that~
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Tsk, I knew I shouldn't have returned to 404.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's a bit too late to regret your decision now~
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Is this really the time to reminisce about the past? Can we get on to business?
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're welcome to discuss "business" anytime~
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Tsk... What's the current situation on the frontlines?
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:All information have been synced to the network. The enemies are autonomous troops, probably dispatched to probe our defenses and firing positions. The first wave is coming from bearing 080 about 3,000 meters away and approaching fast. They will encounter our foremost forces in approximately ten minutes.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We have nothing to fear against those enemies. +Our only concern is if the Military realizes we've broken down, we'll only have five minutes to get away. If they set off from Tallinn right now, then we're pretty much done for.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Then why haven't they set off yet?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Probably because they're now more wary of Griffin due to the losses they've suffered before. +They won't attack until they're absolutely certain about our situation.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's exactly right. +The armored train is still being repaired, so we must destroy the autonomous troops before they can get close. +9, estimated time for the repairs to be completed?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:About another 30 minutes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You all heard that. +We must hold on for at least another half an hour.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Got it. The Commander will direct the echelons to handle the main defenses. Our job is to guard the flanks as a guerrilla detachment and take out whatever slips through. +Any objections?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nope. 9 and Gr G11, you two stay on the train to help with the repairs. 416, we're joining the guerrilla group.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Roger that. I can't wait to teach them a lesson.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Then let's go!
