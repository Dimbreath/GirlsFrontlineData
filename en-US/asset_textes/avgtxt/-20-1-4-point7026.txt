AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Don't forget you're the troublemaker all along. +Come to think of it, are El Clear and El Fail really two separate people?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:At least I think El Fail and I...are two completely different souls. +We have our similarities, but we have our differences as well.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:There might be a way to completely split the two of you.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Huh? Are you serious? But El Fail has been causing so much trouble.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:El Fail should certainly pay for her mistakes. +But I don't believe...that her presence itself is a mistake.

()||:【Hint】The battle ahead is different than usual ones. Please read the following guide. +First, disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand, then switch on 【Music】 in the Settings interface. +When the rhythm bar reaches the line, tap the corresponding T-Doll skill icon accurately to score a combo. +Otherwise, the T-Doll will suffer a certain amount of damage. +Victory is achieved when at least one of your T-Dolls survives the whole song. +Final reminder – please disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand and switch on 【Music】 in Settings to avoid being taken by surprise.
