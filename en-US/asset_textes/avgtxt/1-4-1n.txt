I am so weak and small... I can't do anything.+But thanks to your constant protection along the way, I was able to carry out my duty.+We now have one final task. I must deliver the reports to Miss Helian.+In order to avoid Sangvis' detection and make it in time for her conference with the reconstruction contractors, please accompany me one last time.+Let us do our best together on our final mission, Commander.
