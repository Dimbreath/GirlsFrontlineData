HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Commander, we've arrived in the vicinity of Strongpoint No.2. Allow me to report on the situation. +Strongpoint No.2 is currently under concentrated shelling of enemy artillery. The structures that the enemies air-dropped pose a serious threat to our effort. +We must prioritize destroying these structures before we can launch the rescue mission. +But even after we commence the operation, every target location will still be under fire, making it difficult for us to save all trapped echelons in there. +Commander, we are severely understaffed; frankly, I do not recommend aiming to rescue everybody. +However, considering the following battles, we do need to save all our allies in this strongpoint. +Focusing too much on destroying our enemies will only be a waste of precious time, so I'll need you to lead your echelons to tear open the enemy blockade, then my team will rush in to get our allies out.
()||:...
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:Got everything across to the Commander?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Ja, the Commander will create an opportunity for us to push in and get our friends out. +Do you know who the leader in this strongpoint is?
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:No idea, I didn't have time to sync my data. Do you know anything, Mk 12?
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:I was busy defending the base, how would I have time to find out?! +How about A-91? ...Nevermind, she's drinking.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We're about to charge into enemy fire, your friend's life is hanging by a thread, and you don't even know who she is? How could you be so unprepared?
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:I admit we are not experienced enough.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Then consider everything extra carefully, or you'll die from your own stupidity instead of enemy artillery.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Hey, you yourself haven't synced your data either!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I just got here. I didn't have time to obtain all relevant information.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Ha...so you're as unprepared as us.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Listen, I'm not saying all this to lay the blame on you, but any reckless decision is fatal on the battlefield. +We only have a single objective - rescue as many allies as we can and get back alive!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:416, I finished scouting around the strongpoint— +What's wrong?
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<震屏>:I've had enough! These T-Dolls are too damn inefficient!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Chill, most of Griffin's elite combat forces were expended in the previous battles. It's already quite a stretch pulling T-dolls from logistics teams.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk... +Then do you know who the leader in this outpost is?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:She's the reason I came on this mission... +It's 9A-91. Haven't I already told you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:9A-91 is the leader here... You didn't find out about that from a sync, did you?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I know the answer to your question. Isn't that all that matters?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Studies the screen) ...Then she's our first rescue target. +Listen up. The Commander will focus everything on dealing with the blockade. Since I'm not equipped with a command module, you'll just have to wait for my verbal signal.
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I need you to execute my orders immediately without any hesitation or doubt, affirmative?!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>Reload</SE1><黑屏1>:Now check your gear and await your orders!
()||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2><SE2>Battlefield</SE2>:...Meanwhile, inside Strongpoint No.2.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Is the shelling...still going? I can't hear anything else.
9A91(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...9A-91 puts down her pen.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Guess I'll just leave it at there, and put my diary away.
9A91(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...9A-91 looks around the room and hides it beneath an ammo box.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:I suppose...the Commander won't be coming. +AK-74U and Val... +This is it. Hopefully when I wake up again, my diary will still be intact.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I hope I'll remember you, next time...
