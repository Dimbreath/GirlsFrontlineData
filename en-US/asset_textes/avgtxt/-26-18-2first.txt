NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Angelia, you've been pulling off trick after trick. +I'm fully prepared for that, but I still feel compelled to applaud your resourcefulness. +Sadly, our game of hide-and-seek has still come to an end...
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-YegorDamage(0)||:I knew you'd come. +But I didn't expect you to come alone.
NPC-AngeDamage(1);NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:I know that nothing poses a threat to me in this building. I'm just here to kill you. I don't need help for that.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-YegorDamage(0)||:I still have two T-Dolls with me, Yegor. You shouldn't throw your own life away so easily. We all want to kill you very much.
NPC-AngeDamage(1);NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||:Thanks to your dirty bomb, I will be court-martialed even if I return to the Military. My subordinates will finish what I started. +You know, if I die here, at least I'll still be a hero.
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-YegorDamage(0)||:You're not a hero, Yegor. Never.

Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:A Nyto takes out another syringe and injects the truth serum into my veins.
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏>:The effect starts kicking in quickly, but I can still resist it. I still have a bit of willpower...though I don't know if I'm already running on fumes...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes. +So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I will tell them everything that comes to mind. +The lies, the truth. Let them guess. +I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily. +If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.
