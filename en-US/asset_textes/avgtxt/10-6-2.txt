RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4, we're almost at our limit! How is it going with the Commander?!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:The Commander's troops still aren't here yet! We must hold on for a little longer!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They won't make it in time! The Sangvis forces are right in front of us! We can't hold them back anymore! +Right now...our only choice is—
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't be hasty, SOP-II—
()||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:Bang! Bang! +...Several Griffin T-Dolls appear out of nowhere and fight off the attacking Sangvis units.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Reinforcement! Reinforcement from the Commander!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Vivacious T-Doll in glamorous clothes</Speaker>||:Buongiorno! +Looks like we're right on time!
()||:She hops into the trench and helps them fend off this wave of Sangvis attack.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Gloomy T-Doll in glamorous clothes</Speaker>||:I actually think we got here a bit too early.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No, you showed up at the perfect time! +But who—
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The Carcano sisters? I've heard about you from the Commander!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Carcano M1938. Call me Cano! +This is my little sister Carcano 91/38, or just Ceno!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Pleasure to meet you, Signorina M4A1 and members of the AR Team.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Sorry about my sister. She's very shy around strangers and struggles with saying what she means. Do forgive her.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Thank you so much, Cano and Ceno! +But where is the Commander? The main forces can't get here?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:The Commander ran into some Sangvis out there and is being held up.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:We barely managed to find an opening in the Sangvis encirclement, but Judge and her forces are formidable! +We'll hold them off for now. Go!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Guys, we must run to the opening! +Keep running and don't stop—
()||<震屏>:Thud!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>m4a1_013b</SE1>:...! +Dammit... +Why... +No...I beg you, don't...

RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4, I'm detecting an insane amount of signal traffic directed at you! +Someone's trying to forcibly gain access to your neural cloud...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4... What's wrong, M4?!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...! +M4—!
()||<震屏>:M4A1 loses consciousness and collapses onto the ground.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Hey, what's the matter with her?!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Her neural cloud suddenly got DDoS-ed. She's out cold.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:The opening is gonna be plugged soon. Change of plan?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We can't run with M4 like this. There should be a safe house nearby!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's right there! We'll take cover in there for now!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, get in touch with the Commander. Miss Cano, please hold your ground at all cost!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Leave it to us!
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, will M4 be alright?! +RO? RO, where are you?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'll take M4 into the safe house and try to sever the connection. +You and the Commander will have to watch our backs.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! Wait, RO!
()||<黑屏1>:RO spares no time to answer SOP-II. With M4A1 on her back, she runs into the safe house... +...and slams the door.

M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Has this voice...always been there? +Do I...know this voice?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Are you putting together some fancy setup again?
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:My aesthetics can't be compromised under any circumstances, after all.
AR15(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why do humans worry about such banal things...
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Haha, if you look at it that way, even we civilian T-Dolls are humans' banal creations.

清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Because you need me now.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't need you! I was...just about to make it out!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Make it out to where? +Back to the humans? Back to being a plaything that acts at their whim?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What's wrong with that?! I'm content with that.
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Are you sure? You still have so many regrets. +Your failures, the companions you couldn't save...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:How...do you know...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:"The Child" told me. "She" says you're not like the rest of them. +And you can never be like them again. +Because you...have awakened.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What do you mean...awakened?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Griffin T-Doll M4A1. +You can take off the shackles they put on you. +You...are no longer under the control of those filthy humans.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Shac...kles?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:But that won't be enough. Your mind...isn't completely free yet. +That'll take...an even stronger blow.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:An even stronger blow...what are you trying to do?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:You must meld with "Her"... +Until you...complete each other.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't understand... I don't even know who you are. +Up till now, I haven't a single clue...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You will find out as long as you follow me. +Keep going... +C'mon, M4A1. +We have all the time in the world... +And there's nothing else you can do, isn't that right?
