M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：...I'm fine. I'll live.+In any case, we must get to their location first and find out if...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：Um...don't worry too much.+Our squad has come under Jupiter's barrage a few times before and has come up with some contingencies.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Well... I certainly hope they worked...+We underestimated Dreamer's computing capacity. Maybe this is all part of her plan.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||：M16, I have just contacted the commander.+Execute your preset strategem to rescue SOP-II and my squadmates as soon as all nearby Sangvis units are cleaned up.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Understood. Then you'd better head back first, AAT.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：Huh? Are you sure you don't need my help?
