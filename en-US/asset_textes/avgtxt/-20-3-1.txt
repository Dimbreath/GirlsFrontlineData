AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Damn it... damn it all! +What the hell is this place?! Where's the exit?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Heh, there's no way out of this maze. +Miss Rider, just give up your meaningless struggles and accept my love!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I told you, I couldn't possibly get along with a maniac like you!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:My, my, what a shame. +I thought you of all people would understand me, rocker girl.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You have the wrong idea about rock'n'roll! +You've betrayed music! You've betrayed this city and everyone that lives in it!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:That's fine. It doesn't matter. +You WILL come to understand me once you accept my ideas. +Soon, you'll become one with the city – you won't ever feel bored again, nor will you have any regrets!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:No way out...? +How...am I supposed to fight this monster...alone?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:But you're not alone.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:We've finally found you, AEK!
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:We made it just in time! How wonderful, Miss Rider!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:K2! TMP! You're safe!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Huh? How...did you two escape?
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:We still remember this place! +We led Windtalker and Cat Warrior out of the maze!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Still not giving up, El Fail?! +As you can see, we've smashed the nightmares you created. We'll do the same to this one!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Well, I don't really care... +Since I've already found better candidates than you. +I need to throw a welcome party soon, so let's put an end to the games tonight.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Better candidates? +You can't possibly mean 950 and Thunder?! What did you do to them?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Humph, want to find out? +You know where to find me.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...El Fail's voice gradually fades away.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Is she gone?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Phew... Is everybody alright? +Well done, Sehra and Nina!
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:AEK...
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<震屏>:You big dumb idiot!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Huh?!
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_WHY</BGM>:Why did you ask Sehra and Nina to save us first?! What if something happened to you! +We almost didn't make it!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Sorry, but you're more important to me. +Look...I'm always so willful and selfish. At least let me do something for you at the very end?
AEK999(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Get off your high horse, AEK!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Ack!
AEK999(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:You think that'll fix all the mistakes you've made?! +Discipline is discipline! I won't excuse your slovenly ways just because you tried to sacrifice yourself for us!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Leader...
AEK999(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Likewise, I won't accept your unsolicited self-sacrifice... +...just because you regret your past mistakes. +If you did something wrong, make it right. Don't ever, ever...try to run away.
AEK999(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;K2(0)||:...AEK-999 lets out a dry chuckle.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;K2(0)||:...Jeez, I was being selfless for once, but ended up getting scolded for my efforts.
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:If we didn't arrive here sooner, you'd have gotten more than just a mere scolding!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Haha, so you should thank me for sending Sehra and Nina your way first!
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:AEK!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Ouch, alright, alright! I'll change my ways! But don't expect me to be a good girl like 950 or Thunder! +Oh, speaking of which... Are they...
AEK999(0);DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:Sorry, but El Fail has them very well hidden. We can't find them.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;DJMAXSEHRA(0)||:We need to find 950 and Thunder AND stop El Fail. +Both are difficult. What should we do, Leader?
AEK999(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:TMP, what about that plan?
AEK999(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Let's... give it a shot?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Huh? You have an idea?
AEK999(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:We didn't come empty-handed. +TMP, tell her.
AEK999(0);K2(0)||:
()||<黑屏1>:...
<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...So, that's the plan. Any questions?
<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>()||:You've always had crazy ideas, TMP. Will that actually work in this world?
<Speaker>K2</Speaker>()||:This world is crazy to begin with. Besides, TMP has always had the strongest intuition. +Let's give it a go. Sehra, Nina and I are going after El Fail. AEK, you look for 950 and Thunder. Is that alright?
<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>()||:That's fine, but it's gonna take a long time searching on foot...
<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|()||:Miss AEK, please make your way to the 【Clazziquai】. +We've made arrangements for what you want there.
<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>()||:Oh, really? I'm looking forward to it!
<Speaker>K2</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:Then we're leaving it to you. +Let's set off and work according to the plan!
()||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...K2 and the Fairies arrive at the Black Square.

DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker>Idol Fairies</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:Look, she's there! In the center of the square!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑点1>:What is she doing? Is she...making a speech? +Sehra, Nina, stand by and be ready. I'm heading over!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<黑点2>:History! Order! Art! Trends! +What are these? Can they fill your bellies?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>Wraith</Speaker>||<震屏>:NO!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Impeccable order! Irreproachable morals! Immaculate logic! +No need for MAX COMBO! No need to level up and unlock! +I'm giving you all free boosts! Do you want that?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>Wraith</Speaker>||<震屏>:NO!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:I took away your experience, your memories, your purpose, and turned you into hollow beings... +Do you hate me? Loathe me? Do you want me gone?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>Wraith</Speaker>||<震屏>:NO!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Thank you! Thank you all! +Thank you for playing! +Now, I'm going to invite a Fairy to come on stage. She used to be our friend, but she was deceived by treacherous people and betrayed us.
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:I'm not a traitor!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Then what are you, Rabbit Ears?
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:I'm not Rabbit Ears either. I have my own name! +My name is...my name is...
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter what your name is! What matters is that you used to be a good girl. +That's okay, I forgive you, because I'm also a good Master. +See? I love this city and every one of you so much! So embrace me again!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Enough, El Fail! Stop playing everyone for fools!
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:It's Windtalker!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Putting on a show for an audience of dummies under your control – how much longer are you gonna indulge in such self-aggrandizement?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Self-aggrandizement? +You're the ones being self-aggrandizing! Who gave you permission to come messing with our world? +Anybody? Anyone wants to speak? Huh? Helloooo?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Nobody will say anything, we know that. +However...someone is going to raise their voice!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Haha, how can mute people raise their voice?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:They will. Listen carefully, El Fail and every Fairy here. +This is something we seized back from her... +...Something that belonged to all of you in the first place!
()||<BGM>DJMAX_LadyMadeStar</BGM>:... +......
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:... +This song... +Haha, you've gotta be kidding...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's right, you should know it! +I'm sure you do, since you took it from the Fairies!
DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>|||:...On the other side of the stage, the twin idols start singing.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Fairies! P-Please listen to this song! It belongs to Sehra and Nina! +This is music that's one-of-a-kind and only belongs to them!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Uh... H-Hold on for a second...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:They have what is theirs by right! You used to possess such things as well! +This person, who claims to be your Master, took them all away from you – your name, your memories, your music! She turned you into shadows of your former selves, left to wander around the city aimlessly!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker><震屏>||:I said wait! +You don't understand! I'm trying to protect them!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:How is this protection?! +You're simply treating them like they're your own possessions!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Don't think...that only you have your own music. +As the Master of this city, everything that's yours is mine to begin with!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:All you have is your vanity and self-delusional greed! +Let us decide this city's fate with a proper fight, El Fail!
FAIL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...El Fail sighs heavily.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_BlackCat</BGM>:Reality already sucks enough, and now you want to corrupt our world as well? +As you wish. Come at me. +A friendly reminder – You can't defeat the Queen of Pocket City. All you can do is accumulate meaningless points before you achieve a Break.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's fine... +All we need...is to show everyone their ideals.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Unfortunately, your ideals are exactly what I'm going to rip and tear away from you.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Dreams die. History will be forgotten. Blood, sweat and tears are shed in vain. +Now, let me tell you what really matters! +Come! Say it louder! No turning back!
