M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Commander, sorry but I have bad news to report.+We have lost contact with M4A1 and SOP-II while they were pursuing AR-15...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>;M16(3)||:Hey, M16, Commander! Are you there?!+We just discovered SOP-II's whereabouts!
NEGEV(0);M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Huh? Are their comms back on?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>;M16(3)||<黑点1>:Not sure. We're only reading SOP-II's signal. No news of M4 yet.+And SOP-II hasn't been responding to our calls either.+In any case, I'm sending you her coordinates!
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:This area isn't very far from the base, but a large amount of Sangvis units came surging in just now.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What? Is Alchemist making a comeback?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||:No idea, but it doesn't really look like it...+First of all, the numbers are too great. Commanding this many units is beyond Alchemist's authorization level.+Secondly, their movements...seem kinda chaotic. There doesn't seem to be a clear objective either.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:If they aren't directed at us, then we don't have to be too worried for now.+Let's report to Helian and ask her to consult the database for any plausible Ringleader suspect.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||:That's precisely my plan. But you guys be careful too.+The commander's troops must break through here to get to SOP-II.+Luckily, signal is now back to normal, so the commander can direct our forces into the area.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Understood, Negev.+Commander, please move with caution. Off we go to SOP-II's rescue!
