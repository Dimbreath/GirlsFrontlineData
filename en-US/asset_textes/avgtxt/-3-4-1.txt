G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Phew...we're finally safe. That's exhausting...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Heheh, 416 is obviously more exhausted... +Oh? Not gonna strike back, 416?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +Isn't this a bit strange, 45? +Why had our movements been exposed to Architect's cameras?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Oh? You think that was deliberate? +Your paranoia is running wild again, 416.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Then please say something to cure me.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:416...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... +It takes time to set up the scene. The longer it takes, the bigger our advantage.  +Now is when our operation truly begins.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2>:You see that outpost ahead?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That's...Architect's base, right?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Correct. Our objective is to raid it.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you kidding... +We're in a field full of heavy cannons. Isn't the base even more fortified?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's usually the case. +But this time, we're up against an unusual enemy.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:And we're an unusual team of T-Dolls! +I believe 45 will only act on a foolproof plan!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You lost again, 416.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Sighs) +Well, you're the leader.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Then time to move along, girls. +Give Architect no time to react. Start running!
