TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Sorry to have kept you waiting.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:W-where have you been...?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:We conducted one last investigation and collected some conclusive evidence.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:I don't mind waiting, but you mentioned evidence... Have you got something?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Da, we've had it more or less figured out. +Have you ever heard of "spirit possession"?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...Spirit possession?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Eeep!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Da. +We apologize for suspecting you, but it couldn't be helped. +PK's injuries were caused by a firearm, and other than us, there are no guns in this mansion. +So undoubtedly, one of us did it.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:What...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:As Sten just said, this is a very grave accusation to make. +If you can proclaim this so confidently, surely you have the evidence?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Please be patient and let me finish. +During our previous investigation, Miss Lee and I came across the journals left behind by the owner of the mansion and an explorer. +We have already identified the owner, and the explorer's account has also confirmed past cases of spirit possession in the mansion.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...No, wait a minute. That's really creepy. +You mean one of us has been possessed by a ghost?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'm afraid so. +It seems our scientific understanding of the world has been revolutionized on this very unfortunate day.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:But you were firmly shooting down anything mystical just a while ago... +Okay, even if we take a step back and accept your explanation, how are you going to find the one who's being possessed, and how are you going to prove it?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...This is so ridiculous I don't even know what to say.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I already have an inkling, or rather, an answer to that question. +If there really is a ghost, it can't possibly know anything private about us, including our daily life at Griffin. +So we'll just have to quiz her.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:We don't know each other that well. +For example, 56-1, do you know what my favorite beverage is?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:How would I know?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Black tea.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:See? We aren't... +Huh?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I anticipated that. +Which is why I took this.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:That's...?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:MDR's cellphone.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Is it okay to take it without asking? +Isn't that her most prized possession?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Special circumstances. Can't be helped. +Besides, I'm sure she'd want me to retrieve such an important object for her.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:So what use is it?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:During a previous conversation with MDR, a certain subject came up, so I tried looking it up. +As expected, I logged onto the anonymous forum on her phone and found a large amount of information concerning many T-Dolls' personal information. +I don't know you all that well, but with this, I can confirm my suspicions.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I see. That's clever.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:...But is it really gonna work?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I don't quite believe it myself... +But she did answer your question correctly just now, didn't she?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:I know, but still... What do you think, Papasha?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:That forum...isn't all that credible, is it?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Even Papasha says that, now I'm feeling a bit unconvinced again.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Don't worry. As I said, the answer is right here.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:That's right, sometimes the truth can be very simple. +Isn't that right, Miss Gr G36c?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You're asking me? I suppose so. +Though the forum is filled with baseless rumors, it could contain some credible information.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Then...Gr G36c. +Tell me, what do you think about me?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Gr G36c?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I find you to be a dependable team leader. You are a woman of few words, but rumor has it that you secretly has a girly side.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:What about Gr G36? +I want to know what you think about your sister.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:My sister is a very reliable person. You can always count on her. +I have never seen her show any weakness.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Indeed, Miss Gr G36 is our trustworthy friend. +If you're to give her a present, what would you choose?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:A roomba, maybe? I hear getting one will make her very happy.
()<Speaker>STEN, Type 56-1& PPSh-41</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Is something wrong with my answers? +You all seem a bit astonded.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Your answers are 100% correct. +They are also 100% identical to the posts found on the anonymous forum.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:B-but how should I put it...? +Something just seems way off about you, Gr G36c...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:That's not a very nice thing to say. What could possibly be wrong with me?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:We'll have to start with the attack on MDR. +Sorry for saying all that stuff about spirit possession. Let me state this again – there are no ghosts.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_title</BGM>:...Then what's this all about?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Ghosts don't exist, but "spirit possession" is exactly what's going on here. +Only it isn't a ghost, but an AI.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:An AI?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:That's right. +An "electronic ghost"... +...that's been operating and wandering around this mansion all these years. +Essentially, it is the artificial intelligence in charge of maintaining the mansion.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:That's why we haven't been able to find anyone else no matter how hard we searched. +We're facing a signal flow without a physical form.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It's also why it assaulted MDR electronically. +It hacked MDR's system to gather enough information so that it can blend in among us.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:You've had your eyes on us the moment we set foot in the mansion, which is understandable. +Your defense system went online when we came in. +You also fired the first shot when we exchanged fire with Tokarev's team.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Huh? What are you talking about?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Think carefully, Sten. Back then, why did we start attacking Miss Lee's team?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Um... +Oh, right! +We detected an electronic signal that was trying to hack us all of a sudden!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:By the time we teamed up together, you knew you alone had no hope of defeating us, so you decided to eliminate us one after the other. To achieve that, you couldn't afford to be detected. +That's why you shut down the power in the mansion. +MDR might specialize in electronic warfare, but she was no match for you. +You hacked her system and read her memories about us to reinforce your disguise. +Then you locked the door from the outside, creating an illusion of a locked room – an easy feat for the housekeeper of the mansion.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I guess it was even simpler than that. +You just had to pretend that the door was locked and destroy the lock. No one would be able to tell, right? +Even if that weren't true, thanks to 56-1, we noticed. +To break such a sturdy lock with just a single shot – you must know its design very well.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:That's some reasonable conjecture, but...do you have any evidence?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It was nothing more than a suspicion up till then. What confirmed it was the attack on PK. +Sten, you mentioned that Papasha's scream was so loud you almost went deaf, right?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Right.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It wasn't for me and Tokarev. To us, the scream wasn't particularly loud. +The difference all came down to distance.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Distance?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Back then, you weren't that far away from the church, were you?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:I wasn't... I'd only been going around the church in circles.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Then isn't that odd? What you told us, Gr G36c, is that PK ran after Sten after she left. +That wouldn't be a problem if Sten was moving fast, but she was just casually going around in circles. It's hard to believe that PK didn't catch up with her.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The only explanation is that someone was lying. It's either you or Sten. +And I'm now sure it's you...because of this.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:A shell?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:After talking to Papasha, we retrieved this from the room where MDR was murdered. +It's the shell you left behind when you destroyed the lock. +PK was shot dead. We won't force you to show us your weapon. All we have to do is compare this casing with the bullets inside PK's body and see if they match up.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:And as a final test, I made use of MDR's intel. +It was a bit of a stretch, but I double checked with MDR's neural cloud. +And I found all the clues I needed.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:... +Looks like I've chosen the wrong body.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Abnormal signal detected!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Lower your weapon, Sten! +The body is still Gr G36c's!
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You are a lot more level-headed than I expected. +I thought you would have lost your cool by now.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We've pretty much figured out everything that's happened up till now. +You're the one who sent the transmission that brought us here in the first place, weren't you?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:There are only two things that I still don't understand. +Why are you doing this? Your master – the owner of this mansion – has already passed away for a long time.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Before my master passed away, she gave me one final order. +She wished to keep her works out of anyone's hands. +I am the defense program written to expel all invaders. It is my duty.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Then here's my second question. +Why did you put one of the wedding dresses on PK?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:... +...That? I don't really know either. +To scare you away, I suppose? Wasn't it pretty scary?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't think it's that simple. +Besides, it looked more like some kind of ritual to me.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I don't know. You're the detective – you tell me. +Still, I'm curious. When did you start suspecting me?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I never suspected you. +It's merely the result of deduction. +Or method of elimination, if you like.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Method of elimination?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:In the beginning, MDR was the first to die. Sten and Type 56-1 were both with Tokarev and me. +Then PK became another victim. +That left you and Papasha, but Papasha was with Type 56-1 when PK was murdered. +So there could only be one answer.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You're a real detective, I'll give you that.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:But what really helped me reach this conclusion so quickly was those two sets of journals. +The contents resolved most of my questions... +...and also had me convinced that the culprit is among us.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:It seems my master has given me away.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't think your master would do such a thing. +A person who spent her life hiding in her mansion, avoiding contact with the outside world... +...pursuing her ideal form of aesthetics in the solitude of her own ivory tower. Would such a woman really do this?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:What are you getting at?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:You wrote the journals, didn't you?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:... +... +...What makes you think so?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:You spent too much effort on things you aren't good at. I just found the whole thing very odd. +You could've easily dealt with us, yet you resorted to something so convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. +Which leads me to suspect that you never really meant us any harm.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:This is a large and forbidding mansion that no one dared to approach. +It's impossible to even tell that there's a church on the inside, let alone the wedding dresses, yet rumors about the ghostly bride were being circulated. +You must have let some previous invaders out alive. +They were the ones who started spreading the story.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Though we don't know how it turned into a horror story in which nobody survived.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Your design is flawed, which is why your responses are still so rigid even after reading MDR's data. +You started off as just a simple AI and evolved into what you are now by reading other people. +Those journals kept a very clear record of what transpired. +However, no normal person would write like that – it's too robotic.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You did work on the handwriting, but no one would have the mood to write journals in a life-and-death situation. +That's a pretty comical image, now that I think about it again.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Why would I do that? Do you want me to confess?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't know. You're the culprit – you tell me. +...This is just a guess. +But I think it's the same reason why you dressed PK in a wedding gown.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Reason?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:When I saw PK, I was furious. +But at the same time, I couldn't help but notice just how beautiful the wedding dress is. +You have a very talented master.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Of course. +It took me a long time to pick out that one for her.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It's a shame to keep such beautiful creations hidden forever, isn't it? +You want them to see the light of day. +That's why you did something so contradictory.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:We mean it. +We honestly think these are all proper works of art.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Haha...really? +You think the dresses are beautiful?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I do.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:At least they didn't let Master down. +Master never expected me to become the way I am. +When I first saw you, I knew it for sure. I lost.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:It's enough that you understand that. +... +Hold on, your signal flow is weakening...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...!
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I apologize for hurting your friends. +But if you would just kindly listen to my impudent request...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Go ahead.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Could you... +...take all these wedding dresses with you?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:... +...They're too heavy for us to carry.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Don't kill the moment!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...That's fine. +I'm sure the Commander will find the best use for them.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Good... +...I grovel on the ground. +One side to the empty ashes...one side to the edge of time.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:She...seems to have lost consciousness?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Sten.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Understood. +... +...The abnormal signal has disappeared.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The rain...has also stopped.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:This rain sure knows how to read the mood.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:...What do we do now?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Are the comms back on?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Oh...! I think so!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Then have the Commander send someone to take these dresses away. +We should also clean up the scene.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Gr G36c seems to be okay, though PK will have to take a trip to the repair bay...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Heh... Then let's head back already. +I'm starving for real.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Say, +haven't you forgotten about someone?
