()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:... +After nightfall in the city, in a certain darkened alleyway +AR-15 sits quietly in a blind spot of the surveillance cameras. The light from the city outside filters into the alley and reaches her eyes. +Even when she hears footsteps, she does not look back. Instead—
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:If you point your gun at me, I might return fire by reflex.
AN94(5);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:In that case, don't just pop up from behind me.
AN94(5);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AR-15 puts her gun away, but just as she is about to stand up, AN-94 falls to one knee before her. +This is not a gesture of loyalty, simply a way of facilitating what will happen next. AR-15 knows that very well, so she directs her eyes to the heavy backpack she has just taken off.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I've brought your gear and batteries. There may be a very long fight ahead of us and Ange doesn't want us to waste precious time on running back and forth to resupply.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How did you get here?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Through the sewers. AK-12 found a map of the city's sewers during the last operation, so she handed it to me. There are some places that are quite handy to set up camp in secret. +However, the map's not too complete, and there are some suspicious sources of jamming which you should avoid. After filtering them out, we only have a couple of routes that we can take.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It'd be weird if there weren't any sources of jamming with that white bunch around. +Let's see what you brought... +Ammo...and lots of it, enough for two people. A signal filtering kit, a biothermal analyzer...and what's this crowbar doing here?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:AK-12 told me to bring it, she said it might come in useful. Also, this is your radio, it's been encrypted.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Thank you...and what is this?
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AR-15 holds up a book that was lying at the bottom of the tactical bag.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:It's the Holy Bible.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:And did AK-12 ask you to bring that as well?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Da. She said it could be useful before your operation.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:As if that could be... +...I see, there was a slottable chip with preloaded apps on it.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:Since you're unable to connect to the Zener Network, the chip should be able to help you update your essential functions.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Thank you for your thoughtfulness.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:AK-12 prepared it. If you want to thank anyone, then thank her.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You keep going on about AK-12, how deeply in love with her are you anyway?
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:It's not love... +Ever since I was rolled out, I was designed to accompany and protect her. It is my purpose in life, the guidepost for the actions I take, my fate and my destiny. I believe that should be an accurate description.
AN94(4);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You're almost making me sick.
AN94(3)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:From your combat records, you weren't much different from me in terms of what you did for M4.
AN94(3);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That was because of that damn core order... +But M4 means nothing to me now. +You, on the other hand, sound like how the believers describe their God in that Bible. +It's pathological.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Have you read the Bible before?
AN94(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:My database contains some elementary knowledge on it, along with information about human religions and lifestyle. +...Humans worship their God, and in return they hope God will save them.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(3)||:Then...do you believe in God?
AN94(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why would a Doll need to believe in God? Don't tell me your neural cloud's so fragile that you need God to comfort you and fill the hole in your life?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:I was simply mentioning a possibility, but each and every time you refuse to give me a proper answer.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph... +If I really believed in a god, then my god would be Persica. +Do you honestly think I would feel anything like reverence for a "god" who gave me such a miserable fate?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:To Dolls, everything has already been planned out. Our gods are our creators and our creators' orders are absolute, just like how humans can't question their gods.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What a boring answer.
AN94(3)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:However, unlike how humans are shackled by destiny, we are unbound, except by the orders of our gods. +That is why we are called "DEFY". +We cannot escape the choices of our gods, but I can make choices of my own outside that. +And my choice is that no matter what AK-12 expects of me, I will do as she wishes.
AN94(3);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Even if it means you will struggle without hope for the sweet release of death?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Unlike you, we don't have the concept of death. +The purpose for our existence is to complete our tasks and support a certain someone.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...I've had it. +Pretend I never brought this up.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Have I upset you?
AN94(4);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:... +It seems I've upset you.
AN94(4);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +I don't really understand why Ange arranged for us to be in the same team. +Looks like we won't be great conversational partners. In that case, let's focus our attention on how to carry out our upcoming mission.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||<BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM>:Yes, the mission is the highest priority. +Your energy accumulators should be fully charged now, so we can begin the operation after your body calibrator gives you the green light.
AN94(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Roger. +I'll handle the outskirts, you take care of the city districts. We'll split up and move separately. +"If you spot those white bastards, don't carelessly exchange fire."
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:"Verify their location; the top priority is to see if they're linked to the 'Node'."
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>＝:Orders verified. 5 seconds remaining. 3, 2, 1, — move out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>84</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 slowly forges ahead through the city streets, in the bustling heart of the commercial district.

AN94(0)<通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Received. I'm entering a region with high signal density as planned. How are things on your end?</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Carrying out passive scanning as planned.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Other than your region, there are 43 new locations with suspicious signals, and 18 of them are confirmed to be using White Faction wavelengths. I can't accurately pinpoint the others. Do I need to increase scanner power?</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No need. Ange said that someone else will handle the small fries. We mustn't run the risk of exposure.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Focus on finding the clues to the "Node". We need to filter through to the high-value targets ASAP.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Understood. I'm currently eavesdropping on all the verified units. No extra news for the time being.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Although...the strange thing is that I've discovered signal wavelengths similar to S.F.'s.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>S.F.?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What's S.F. doing here?!</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>Similar to S.F. It only appeared for a moment and I thought I had been mistaken...but they were very similar, to the point where one could conclude that there were S.F. Dolls in the city.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Why would S.F. come to Belgrade...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>In that case, will she come here too...</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>AR-15...our main objective is not those S.F. Dolls.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We should make completing our mission our top priority.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But...</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...You're right, we don't have much time.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Make a note of the signal source, we can talk about the rest after the mission is complete.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I've marked the location.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Let's not worry about that for now.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Now then...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>...I've reached the target sector.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This is...a military camp?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>161</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑屏2>:... +The soldier on sentry duty looks around, and just as he turns back, a shadow silently leaps over the wall surrounding the camp.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>AN-94, can you hear me?</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Received. How are things?</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm already inside the military base. As I expected, the signal markers here are very obvious... A very amateurish way of hiding a signal. I was even a little worried that this was a trap.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>So are you going to leave?</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's not the first time I've known it was a trap and walked into it anyway. More importantly, I can't just come away from this empty-handed.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Help me set up a secure channel, I need to contact Ange.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Must you use the radio? No matter how much you encrypt them, old signal patterns like that are easily intercepted. It's not like we can't unlock your Zener Protocol...</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't want to hear that voice again. Could you cut the chit-chat?</color>
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>As you wish.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Secure channel established. I'll maintain it for 60 seconds.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Hailing Ange, please come in.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Received. How's progress?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is AR-15.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm investigating the first cluster of white signals. This is a garrison camp, but not a large one. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>It's very likely that the military district is linked to the "Node", so I'll be sneaking in to scout the place.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I can verify the position of the signal here for the most part. Will any demolition be required?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't be hasty.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Others will handle the task of eliminating the infiltrators. All you need to do is send all the positional data you've collected to me.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Conduct a full reconnaissance on the entire camp. My instincts tell me there's a big fish there.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't get it.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>How important is the "Node"?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Is it really alright to leave the enemies hiding here alone, even if they might end up hurting or killing the humans in this city?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>The mission I gave you was to find clues related to the "Node", not protect civilians.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You're not a PMC employee anymore, AR-15.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Understood.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>AN-94's also found some white signal clusters apart from this camp. There are even S.F. signals in the city.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>Is that so...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>94, what's the exact number of signals you've screened?</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>52, and nine more signal sources appeared in the past 30 minutes.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>It makes no sense that so much trash could burrow in here and not be detected.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Even if their "Baptized" are here, hiding so many entities at once is very difficult.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>According to my investigations, they're not bothering to hide themselves at all.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>That would mean...there's a problem with the immune system.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>So having white signals in a garrison is a perfectly reasonable answer.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>However powerful the White Faction might be, I doubt it extends to making the local army do their bidding...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>From what I know, this country has maintained absolute neutrality.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't think it's possible that the army would obey the White Faction's commands either.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Maintaining one's neutrality in a dangerous situation requires stringently-selected troops and great political skill.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But leaves only fall after the roots have rotted.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So they've been compromised from the inside, then...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I understand.</color>
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>The secure channel is going to expire soon.</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>166</BIN>:AN-94 shuts off her comms. +A soft sensation rises up from her leg and one of the stray cats wandering through the park attempts to jump onto AN-94's thigh. +AN-94 bends down to lift the cat up onto her lap and gently caresses its soft fur.
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An adorable creature, is it not?

AN94(0);NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sorry, my apologies. I'm a local resident and I often come by to feed the cats, so please don't mind me.
AN94(0);NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girl scatters some cat food on the ground, and the cat that was seated on AN-94's lap immediately jumps down.
AN94(0);NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Then, it's about time to take my leave as well.
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AN-94 stands and prepares to leave. +As she passes the girl, the girl muses aloud...
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Are you also like that? A cute and cuddly predator?
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<震屏>:!!
