M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Hey, so you're 416, eh?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Fräulein Thompson, nice to meet you.
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Is this the first time we've meet?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Of course?
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Indeed, I haven't heard of you before, but I've heard all about everything you did today. You're Griffin's hero.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:A hero who spent the entire rescue mission skulking behind cover?
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:You whipped these rookies fresh out of IOP's factory into such good shape. That's a lot more impressive than crashing through enemy ranks all by yourself.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:What did they do to deserve such generous praise from an ace like you?
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:They braved the enemy's artillery fire with no means of communication and came charging into the strongpoint to get us out of danger.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:That's the least they could do, it was our objective, after all.
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:But they were disciplined and orderly throughout the process - not a single mistake. +If it weren't for your wealth of experience, 416, it would've been impossible to improve their coordination so much in just a few hours.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:I am indeed no stranger to the battlefield, but this isn't the time for telling stories. +Or...are you that desperate to learn about me?
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Leave it for now, but I like that look in your eyes; I could use a partner like you in my next interrogation assignment. +Still, I'm just trying to express my gratitude. Griffin has nurtured a lot of reliable comrades-in-arms while I wasn't looking. +It's an honor to meet you. I hope we'll have more opportunities to work together in the future.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:I can't say for sure. It's entirely up to the organization I belong to. Maybe it'll never happen again.
HK416(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Then I'll treasure it this time.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Thompson waved and walks off.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You seem to be alive.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:The "seem to" is superfluous, and "alive" is overrated.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Looks like we didn't disappoint you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I didn't anticipate this outcome. You did well enough - without me.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:That's what it truly means to be a Tactical Doll, right? +We aren't just pawns; we make our own judgments, and trusting you is one of them.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:What was that judgment based on?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You saved 9A-91, you saved my friends. I know you'll save even more.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Friends are important, but seeing that we're on the battlefield, we must be prepared to lose everything.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Do you have friends, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:... +I'm not sure if "they" count.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:When you get caught in a blast, will they run over to help you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:No, they know I'll think of a way to get myself out of trouble.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Having friends could be a way.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:It's not one I'm particularly comfortable with, I do well enough on my own. +It's time. Let's move.
AK74U(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...416 stood up and prepares to leave.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Won't you even consider staying?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:If you stay at Griffin, you can try different ways. +Not just having friends, but other possibilities as well. We know even you aren't omnipotent.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I won't have the chance.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Maybe next time.

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:74U, give me your take on the situation.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:From an optimistic point of view, it's FUBAR. +Not only is Strongpoint No.4 under intense bombardment, it's even surrounded by the enemy's heavy armored troops. +All the tactics I can come up with will blow up in our face.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:What about the trapped T-Dolls?
HK416(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:They're led by MP40, do you know her?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Python(0)||:As I recall, she isn't an elite T-Doll, so why is she the leader of an outpost?
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>;Python(0)||:Strongpoint No.4 was abandoned. She led a logistics team to deliver ammo to Miss Thompson and ended up being trapped in there.
Mk12(0);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Simply put, it was an unfortunate accident.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>;A91(0)||:Fortunate, you mean. They'd have been destroyed along the way otherwise.
Mk12(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:The building was under the HOCs' cover and the Fairies' protection, so it hasn't fallen yet. +However, once the enemies gather for real, it'll crumble just like that.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>;Python(0)||:Should we...rescue them?
Mk12(0);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:It's not exactly cost-effective, is it?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;A91(0)||:Since when did you become...like this?
HK416(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:We're weighing our options objectively - whether the returns are worth the risk.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Python(0)||:You learn fast and you learn well.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Not to mention, judging by MP40's personality, she won't turn into a nasty ghost and bother us even if we give up on her.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:That was rude.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Just stating facts.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:So you'd crash someone's birthday party and tell them they're gonna die one day?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:It's fine if this person can't beat me up. +MP40? I don't think she stands a chance against me.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:So, do you all agree to abandon this last echelon?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:(Snickers) ...
AK74U(0)<Speaker>All</Speaker>||:Certainly not!
