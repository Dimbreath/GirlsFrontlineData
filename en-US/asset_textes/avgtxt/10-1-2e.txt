帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh? Have you come to, kitty cat?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏2>:This is 16LAB, your birthplace. +Now let me run a check on your neural cloud... +Hmm... It seems...to be running just fine.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who...are you...?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Persicaria, your creator.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why...did you create me?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You are to be the leader of the AR Team and lead the best T-Dolls that I've ever created.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:T-Dolls... +Am I...a T-Doll?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:From now on, yes. +You're much cuter than I imagined, now that you've recovered... +I hope you can...give me the answers that Lyco couldn't...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Lyco? +...What answers?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well...it's too early for that. Why don't we meet your new comrades first?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:So you're M4A1? M16A1, a T-Doll like you. +Pleasure. Guess I'll be taking orders from you.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Your...eye?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Haha, does this scare you? +No need to be scared. This eyepatch...is just a memento. Cool, isn't it?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hmm...
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right, I'm what you'd call a veteran. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions. +I also like drinking. Feel free to ask me out for a drink. +...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:This...was the first time I met them... +My...very first memory...
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But it's not our first memory. +Come, M4A1. Look over here. +Look at me...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>100</BIN><黑屏2>:... +We... +We finally meet.
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||:Are you happy? +Or...are you still afraid?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Should I be afraid?
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||:We are enemies. Of course you should be afraid. +But you aren't.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm...not afraid. +What exactly...are we...?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4! +Don't be fooled! Don't let that voice confuse you!
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Youthful female voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>101</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Where are you going? Wait!
()||:The little girl runs off, leaving M4A1 standing alone before a mirror.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is...me?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Just give me some more time! You can wake up very soon!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:RO...? +RO, are you there?!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I told you I'd be back. +You can't see me, but I know you're here!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why...why are you still here? I'm...already like this...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't care what you've become, M4A1. This is my mission.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But...we've only known each other for a few hours...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<震屏>:This is why I was created in the first place! +I was created...to save you at this very moment!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This shouldn't be what you live for... +Your purpose isn't even derived from your own free will!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So what? +At least right now, I'm happy. I'm happy to have met you and the AR Team.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't you understand? You're designed to feel that way! All T-Dolls are.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I can live with that! Why does it matter if my feelings are artificial or not?! +At the very least...I'm doing my best for what I believe is good... +My feelings might not be my own, but my smile is genuine!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:AR-15 wanted me to save you. M16 wants me to save you. So does SOP-II as well as the Commander! +M4A1... +I might not be acting out of my own free will, but I'm doing this because everyone is counting on me. +Even if you don't believe me, at least believe those who have always supported you. +C'mon, take my hand. Let's go back together...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:RO... +I'm sorry I forgot... +I said it myself...that we won't be apart ever again. +We're sticking together...through thick and thin.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's right! Then come back! At least we can die together!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait... +What's that noise?! +M4, can you hear that?!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>Heartbeat</SE2>:What noise? I can't hear it!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No, this place is too dangerous. I need to get you out. +C'mon, M4! Follow me—
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:...Clack! +...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +RO? +RO, where are you? +What happened...? Are you alright?! +RO—! Where are you?! +RO—!!
()||<SE2>Heartbeat</SE2>:M4A1's calls are answered only by a dreadful silence.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:...Silence, darkness, and endless confusion.
