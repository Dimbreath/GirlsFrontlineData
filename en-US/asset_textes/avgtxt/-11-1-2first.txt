BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hey, Dreamer. +An abnormal signal has made its way in.
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:It's not Griffin's style to be this ostentatious.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:You're right... Now that I give it a proper look, it really isn't a Griffin signal... +In fact...the signal looks like one of ours...
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Never heard of it. Let me see. +... +That's a signal under OGAS Protocol, Destroyer. Can't you even figure that out?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:OGAS? What's that?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh dear... Looks like I forgot to give you an update about this... +Please remember, the OGAS Protocol is the network system we use at Sangvis Ferri. It's completely different from the Zener Protocol used by those pieces of Griffin trash. +Anyone with a signal like this is one of our own.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:One of our own? Is anyone scheduled to come here? I haven't heard anything about that.
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Or... +It's a Parapluie carrier.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:Parapluie? You mean... +Uh...the virus that can invade a Griffin T-Doll and overwrite her system for our own use?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Haha...it's really made itself useful this time. +She comes waltzing in just like that. Saves us the recon work.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:I've already activated the brand new self-detonation units. That should be enough to give them a proper welcome. +By the way, Dreamer, is my new body still not ready? +It seems like you've only moved me somewhere else to be on standby after my nap...
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:I had to extract your neural consciousness and move your body to the local refit factory. It should be ready for assembly soon. +But now, I need to confirm our visitor's identity so the process will suffer a slight delay. Please help me lock on to the signal. +Next, I want you to make a broadcast for me as a test.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<黑屏1>:Tsk. Such a slave driver... Fine. I'll do as you say. +I'm cool as long as I can finish them with my own hands.

UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:UMP9 hailing Sier. I repeat, UMP9 hailing Sier.
UMP9(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ah, 9. Anything to report?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:We've found a suitable base to launch our search. Our electronic warfare modules are fully functional. +We'll be starting our hunt for the drone soon. The others are setting things up.
UMP9(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:That's great. Keep it up.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:Heheh, Sier is probably our only source of encouragement when we're on a mission. +By the way, I want to ask about something. Is Dier there?
UMP9(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:One second. I'll fetch him. +Dier come over here! +What game?! Can't you pause it?!

UMP9(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>||:Tsk, jeez, what do you want? +Huh? Why the secure channel?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Just the tiny matter I asked you to look out for before.
UMP9(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Ah, you mean the thing about UMP45?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Ja, her 24-hour electroneuralography. It's been 24 hours now, hasn't it?
UMP9(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Oh, the result is already out. Let me see... +Uh...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:What is it?
UMP9(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Emmmmm... +It looks alright, just a bit strange.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Hey, doesn't that mean it's NOT alright?!
UMP9(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Well, every T-Doll has something strange about their neural cloud. +The dataflow in 45's cloud would spike at certain intervals but the surges always subsided instantly.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Spike? What's the cause?
UMP9(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:It's usually due to file transfer, cache dumping, or even watching video feeds. +These actions all result in an increase in dataflow, and the spikes in 45's cloud were still within normal parameters.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:(Sighs) Dier, can I trust you?
UMP9(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Don't worry. You may be outlawed T-Dolls, but this is still my job. +If even the slightest thing happens to you, it's gonna be on my head!
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Then I guess I'll just have to take your word for it... +Please keep an eye on 45's condition and make the safety of her neural cloud your priority. Can you do that?
UMP9(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:No problem, but only if it doesn't jeopardize your assignment.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Humph, of course. Then I'm leaving it to you.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:9, have you finished your report?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Ah, ja, just done with it. Is the prep work all sorted, 45?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We've encountered a small problem, but no need to worry. We're gonna take care of it soon...

HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:What's happening? Is that...?
HK416(2);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Destroyer... It's definitely her. If she's here now...

破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I know what you're here for, and catching you is only a matter of time. +Well? Are you confused? Are you scared?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Doesn't stop talking, does she? Can we kill her now? +She's just a Ringleader that's been killed so many times I lost count.
G11(0);UMP45(2)||:
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Oh, I even know what you guys are thinking... +You're gonna say, "She's just a Ringleader that's been killed so many times I lost count."
()||:Clap! Clap! +Destroyer starts clapping during the broadcast.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I admit that I've taken...a bit of a beating before. +But today, I must tell you that I've undergone a complete refit!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:In just a bit...In just a bit, I'll have access to a brand new form... +Powerful! Agile! Beautiful! You won't stand a chance against me! +You'd better start praying you'll die before I get to you, AHAHAHAHAHA!
