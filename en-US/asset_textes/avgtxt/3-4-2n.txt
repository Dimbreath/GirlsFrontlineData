OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:They're still rambling on in there. How are you doing, Mosin-Nagant?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||:Hmm. I...I'll be fine.
M1891(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:You must be bored out of your mind standing here like a china doll...while worrying about your sister...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||:Makarov's on it so I have no reason to worry. But there's still no news...
M1891(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:That area used to be an important base for Sangvis. It'd take time to figure it out.+Don't worry. Helian has even sent a commander to help them...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||:Hush... If the military catch wind of this...
M1891(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:You're right. They won't want us to use the commander for something like this.+Still... Helian actually dispatched a commander to save Nagant.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||:Da, I'm very grateful for her decision.+No matter why she did it or how it turns out...
M1891(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Haha, there you are, Mosin-Nagant!
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||:Huh...?
M1891(0);M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:I made it back! Did you miss me?
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>;M1895(0)||:Humph. Things seem to have turned out pretty well.
OTs14(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Gosh... We're dead beat.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>;AK47(0)||:But this reunion scene makes it all worthwhile.
SKS(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Bolshoe spasibo, AK47, SKS...+And...where's Makarov?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:She's off to see Helian. Got something important to report, I think.
M1895(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Is it the thingie you had in your hand? She took it with her.
M1895(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:What on earth is it? Is it really that valuable?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That...+Is just a normal communicator, as far as I know.
 ()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:Meanwhile, in Helian's office.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:The operation was a huge success. You and the commander will receive your commendations very soon.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Spasibo.+Forgive me for being presumptuous, but is there something special with this communication device?
PM(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Oh? You don't usually ask such questions.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:I'm just a little intrigued...by the order we received.
PM(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:This is an item left behind by AR-15. We have reason to believe that Sangvis might have tampered with it.+16Lab wishes to study it. It might just...become the key to our victory.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:...I see.+We couldn't have succeeded this time without the commander's guidance.
PM(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I expected as much. So?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:If...+If Nagant hadn't been in possession of this item, would you still have sent the commander to help us?
PM(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+Makarov, you...
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:(Smiles) You seem to have gained an interest in your own purpose.
Makarov()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Da...+Or you could say, I have gained an interest...in ourselves.
