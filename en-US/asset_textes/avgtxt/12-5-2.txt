M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Have we crushed her firewalls?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||:No... I don't want to put that on... I don't want to forget everything...! +I'm a failure... Instead of living as such...please just kill me! +It hurts! Please, let me go! I don't want this to go on! +I can't... I can't hear anything... I can't see anything...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What is she talking about...? +No, wait. Is this...her memory?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||:It feels like...I'm disappearing... +The pain...also disappearing... +My consciousness...slipping away... +Father...do you still need me?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I can hear her voice, but it's intermittent. Is there interference?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||:Is someone talking to me? +Who is it? Are you here to save me? +Or have you come...to replace me?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's alright, you'll be fine.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You simply haven't been chosen because you aren't perfect.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That voice!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||:I knew right from the start that I wouldn't be chosen... +In that case, just let me disappear. Don't let me turn into a monster... +That voice...is replacing me... +It...is tormenting me... +Why? Father...you don't want me, do you?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You ARE wanted. So long as we're together...</color>
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||:No...you're consuming me... +If I can't remain myself, then let me die! +<size=45>If I can't remain myself, then let me die!</size> +<size=50>If I can't remain myself, then let me die!</size>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can't allow that. You're wanted.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hey, are you trying to take over her neural cloud? +Just like how you tricked me and locked me on Level III?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That isn't me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's just one of its memory fragments.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But that voice...and even the tone are totally yours! +I knew it... You're a liar! +Even if that wasn't you, it doesn't change the fact that you've done something like this before!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Like you, this is the first time I've ever encountered it. I don't know what happened to it in the past.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:As you said, this definitely has something to do with us... +And the conclusion I've drawn...is that you cannot be trusted!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Black-Clad Girl</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:If I can't remain myself, then let me die! +If I can't remain myself, then let me die! +If I... +I am...Nyto...

()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Crap. Was I discovered even with Lunasia's signal as disguise?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Tsk... We're about to get hit by a massive torrent. Our enemy is not to be underestimated.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's a bit of a shame to just destroy you, but I can't let you cause any harm to Lunasia's neural cloud!</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That voice seems to be tangled up in the offensive firewalls on Level II!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>If I take this opportunity and sever the connection with her on Level II, I might be able to leave the consciousness in the system over there!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lunasia, what are you doing?!</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:I'm sorry... +And goodbye!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>161</BIN><黑屏2>:... +Have I finally returned to the surface?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You're back?! +Tell me, what took you so long?
()||:M4A1 turned around and looked at ST AR-15. The entire room was littered with white unit corpses. ST AR-15 was shoving a girl clad in black away from her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dammit... These things are way too tenacious... Did you fry them all on Level II?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I think...she did it in the end?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:What? +...Hold on, you're...M4?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Y-yes...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Thank goodness. +What about the consciousness?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I've regained control over my body. +While we were in these unknown enemies' central system, I left Level II and severed the connection when the consciousness was busy wrestling with the enemies.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Good for you... It must've been tough. +What should we do now? +I've used up all my ammo, and it's starting to get dark...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...? We've returned to the original theater in such a short period of time?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:A short period of time?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:How long have I been away?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Starting from when you started acting odd, it's been almost a whole day.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Holy...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We found shelter in a house and waited out a blizzard, then we came back to the theater. +We found a place where Ange had been, and these unidentified white enemies appeared out of nowhere. +Just now, the consciousness said she was going to hack into their network, but several hours had gone by and nothing happened. +Then they found our location and launched an attack immediately. +I barely managed to repel them with my remaining ammo and explosives, but then this black thing again sprang up out of nowhere. +It seemed to be equipped with some kind of shield – my ammo couldn't get through at all. +I had no choice but to cut off its head with my knife, but it was a lot stronger than I expected! +Thank goodness it suddenly stopped moving when things got really dicey!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sorry for putting you through all that... +I've never seen you so rattled...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You'd also be this rattled if you had to face so many enemies all by yourself! I couldn't even leave you behind and just run for it!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sorry...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Whatever. It wasn't your fault. +You said you were in their system. Got any ideas?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:My neural cloud does contain the relevant records, so the consciousness was actually successful in her search for information about these enemies. +Hold on, let me analyze the records... +...Right, I've figured out their current locations, I would say...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's the situation?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is really bad... +These white units are extremely vast in number and they've already set up an encirclement around the outskirts of the city. +According to the communications logs, the main bulk of Griffin's troops have already withdrawn by choppers.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk... Then what should we do?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ange should still be somewhere near the city; I can deduce her rough location from the information I have, and she seems to have put up quite a fight. +Judging by the her inferred location, the Military didn't manage to trap her in their encirclement, but the only opening is in the other direction from where we are.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So we'll have to go around to the opening in their line of defense?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The Military are constantly shifting their positions. If we run into them, we're in no shape to fight.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then what do you propose?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ange must be trying to break through the encirclement. We still have a chance to regroup with her. +Plan A – we move together to evade the Military forces, then rendezvous at the extraction point. +Plan B – we inform her of our location and situation before she leaves, and she might be able to arrange for someone to come and pick us up. +However, whichever plan we decide to go with, establishing contact with her is still the prerequisite.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I just hope we won't have to resort to Plan B. +I can't bear to stay a minute longer in this freaking place.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:There's a civilian signal tower in the outskirts of the city. We may be able to boost our signal and get in touch with Ange.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is it far from here?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's a fair bit of distance, and we'll have to cross a Military-controlled zone.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Things just keep getting worse and worse... I hope Ange can stay alive long enough to receive our signal.
