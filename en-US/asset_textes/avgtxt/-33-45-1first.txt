M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is it finally over?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, it's over.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's the end for both the uploaded consciousness and this half-cold body.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:OGAS... If you take over this body, what will happen to the Isomers?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They exist at the very bottom of the consciousness and will finally be spared the pain of death and mutual destruction.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Their existence...greatly saddens me... They kind of remind me of my very distant past...my previous master.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Previous master...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't understand what I'm feeling either. I need to learn more.</color>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is that so...? Well, I can relate to that.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||:It feels very strange...to have a physical form... I need some time to get used to this.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Before that, the control access for the quarantine wall.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's open now. Time to leave this city of grief behind.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>The enemy has already launched six rounds of bombardment. Our shields have taken a heavy beating and won't last much longer.</color>
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Should we think of another solution?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What other solution? The tracks ahead are completely blocked off. Other than being sitting ducks here, what else can we do?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Just keep waiting. M4 will surely clear the way for us.
()||:All of a sudden, the towering quarantine wall in the distance starts moving. It rumbles thunderously and drowns out the widespread sound of gunfire. 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:She did it! I knew she wouldn't let us down!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4, did you open the quarantine wall?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Is everybody alright? I'm not far from the battlefield. What's the current situation?</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've commandeered a military armored train! +But they've been attacking us with their other train. Even if we fall back right now, they won't let us go! Our shields are going to give out soon!
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>Understood. We can't let the Military pin us down here. Patch me through to the Commander. We have a tough battle ahead.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2><BIN>202</BIN><黑屏1>:Commander, sorry to have kept you waiting. The quarantine wall is now open, and the interference in the city has been neutralized. I have a new friend with me whom I'd like you to accommodate. +I understand that the situation is very dire, so please start the train immediately; I've already made it back to the tracks. +I would like to lead the AR Team in obstructing the Military's armored train to buy you some time, but I require your assistance. +Don't worry, fighting these enemies will be a stroll in the park for us. This is our final battle; I'm sure you will lead us to victory. M4 out.
