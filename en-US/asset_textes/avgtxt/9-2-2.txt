NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：...Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Yegor(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Apologies, who might you be?
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Yegor, Captain.+The General ordered me to wait for you here. Please come with me.
NPC-Yegor(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Looks like the military has been busy lately, seeing as the youngsters are getting promoted. Lead the way, Captain Yegor.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>：......
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>||：Please have a seat.+The General is giving a speech right now and will be with you shortly. Please wait.

NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：This joint operation will greatly improve the cooperation between the military and private military contractors, and we shall closely and efficiently mobilize our resources...+To ensure that our citizens are able to live in a safe and stable environment...+As well as to prevent economic and infrastructure development from being affected by the disturbances of the outside world...+We shall construct an elite and efficient safeguard mechanism by utilizing private enterprises in security.+If this test succeeds, we shall expand into other areas using this experience and accelerate the country's development.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Reporter A</Speaker>||：The government had already handed over the protection of some outer areas to PMCs in the past. Does this cooperation mean the military will take back the management rights to these areas?
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：The objective of this cooperation is to better protect the vulnerable regions. The central government is responsible for the administrative management of these regions, and the military will abide by its decisions.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Reporter B</Speaker>||：Two days ago, the United Nations released a list of new member countries. Is this operation a response to the "Alliance of the United Nations" plan?
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：I repeat, the objective of cooperating with private enterprises is to ensure the safety of these regions. There is no political motive behind it. Your question should be directed at the government's press conference, not here.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：The media is really hard to deal with, huh? Has the General received special training?
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>||：......
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(0)||：(Shrug) You're cautious. I like subordinates like you, including my Commander over here. 
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：The General's speech has concluded. He will be with you shortly.
()||<黑屏2>：...Three minutes later.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Sorry to keep you waiting. Dealing with the media is more complicated than I imagined.
NPC-Carter(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Really? I think you'll make a great company spokesperson after you retire.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：I'm satisfied with my retirement nest egg. Working at this age is too strenuous for me.+Anyway, congratulations Berezovich, the information you acquired is extremely important to us. Next, we'll...
NPC-Carter(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：Indeed, being something that could draw the attention of the military, it's important all right.
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<SE1>Select</SE1>：!!
NPC-Yegor(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：Oi oi... Pulling a gun on your boss's guest is quite rude.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：It's okay, put your gun away.
NPC-Yegor(0)<Speaker>Captain Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：Yes, sir.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：I wanted to ask how you got in, but it would be a meaningless question, wouldn't it, Havier?
NPC-Carter(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：It's not out of the ordinary to come to an important banquet hosted by my old friend and patron, is it?+It's been a while, Carter, and Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Carter(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||：...Havier extends his hand.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：......+...Nice to meet you, Mr. Havier.
