()||<BIN>98</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:The Sangvis offense is completely decimated. Griffin has successfully protected the Military's interference neutralizer.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That was fantastic! We dealt with all those Sangvis troops so quickly! +RO, is this how powerful the military units are?
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh? Even you find them remarkable, SOP-II?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:They are nothing to sneeze at in terms of pure firepower and mobility. +But then again...these big oafs aren't entirely invincible.
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So you noticed it too. As expected of you. +But with the might of the Military, mowing down the Sangvis forces shouldn't be a problem, right?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Even so, I wouldn't miss the capture of Mastermind for the world. +Especially since...she probably has M16...
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II... +M4's here...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Oh, M4! You did well!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Good, you're okay. +The Commander is asking for our next objective. We'll probably have to move right away. Will that be a problem?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Nope! I've been waiting for this!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:RO...
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hmm?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I just want to say...sorry... +I was rather rude to you because of my turbulent mental state... +If it weren't for your support, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish our mission.
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh...don't mention it. +There's no need to apologize either. I've forgotten all about it, haha...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You have bold ideas and make keen observations. You also have the drive to put things in action. +It is an honor to have you on the AR Team.
SOPII(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Uh... +Haha, is that so? I still have a lot to learn, so let's watch out for each other.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry you have to join us under such circumstances. +From the combat records SOP-II sent me, I can see that you really are an outstanding T-Doll. +That's why, just like M16, I've decided to have faith in you. You are now officially part of the team.
SOPII(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I also have faith in you, M4A1, and I'll defer to your authority. +I'll also put in some strong opinion when the situation calls for it. Don't hold my grating voice against me, okay?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sure. I'm counting on you... +(Please, support me and guide me forward, just as AR-15 and M16 once did.)
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:There's still the last part of the welcoming ceremony. Should we wait till we finish off Mastermind?
SOPII(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't mind. It's not gonna take long anyway.
SOPII(0);RO635(2)||:
()||:Click. +A transmission request from the Commander.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Your order, Commander. +Follow the Military forces? +Understood. We're on our way. +Yes, the AR Team will stick together.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:Are we setting off?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yes, the Military is marching toward the Sangvis stronghold. +We are to follow them and protect their flank.
SOPII(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Guard duty? Do you think our vehicles are fast enough to catch up with the military units?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Can't be helped. That's our order. We'd better get started.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:We're off! As long as we stick together, there's nothing we can't do!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(As long as we stick together...huh...)
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:What's wrong, M4?
SOPII(0);RO635(0)||:
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Nothing... Let's go.
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏2>:Congratulations. +You didn't lose anyone this time.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That was just the first step. +I wonder if there'll come a day...when I'll be willing to sacrifice everything for victory...just like Yegor...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:No pain, no gain – there is no victory without sacrifice. However, if you're strong enough, you can minimize your loss.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes...I must grow stronger... +Only then...only then can I...
