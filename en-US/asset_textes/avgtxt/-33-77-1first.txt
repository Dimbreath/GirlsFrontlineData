()||:【Ange.】
()||:【I told you not to speak to me unless you have to.】
()||:【Movements detected in the distance. 120km from here.】
()||:【Show me the monitor.】
()||:【A strong heat source. It's an armored train armed to the teeth. Griffin's armament is no match against that.】
()||:【You've worked with Griffin before; you should know they aren't really the type to rely on brute force.】
()||:【I understand, but I would like to remind you that the enemy's target is this base. If they decide to make a run through Tallinn, Griffin will not be able to keep up with the train.】
()||:【Tsk... The entirety of Estonia is within the contamination zone. What kind of honey jar is this Paldiski Base to draw so many flies towards it?】
()||:【The Navy once called it the Paldiski Secret Administrative Center. It was a port for repairing nuclear submarines.】+【But it has another name according to our internal classified documents - OKB-167. In the previous Soviet era, the 16th Directorate of the KGB had hidden a Pike reserve deep within the base that deterred the entire Scandinavian region.】+【Now the problem is, we don't know what is left of it.】
()||:【You actually sound like a normal person when you're giving information.】
()||:【However, the base was completely sealed off 30 years ago.】+【Opening a base sealed under the Relics Treaty would trigger an alarm in Moscow. Any perpetrator who isn't operating under a direct order from the central authority would be executed immediately. This order has always been carried out strictly without a single exception.】
()||:【Is the Relics Department so influential?】
()||<黑屏1>:【It's mostly due to the fear of another wide-spread pandemic - like monkeys who've experienced electric shock, if you will.】+【The only difference between humans and monkeys is that humans understand the use of electricity. Isn't it in a human's nature to take risks for the sake of benefits?】
