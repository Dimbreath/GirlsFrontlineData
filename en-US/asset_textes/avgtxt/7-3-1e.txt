M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>：Have you confirmed SOP-II's location, Makarov?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：Da, she is exchanging fire with Dreamer's troops in an abandoned factory.+Things are not too bad at the moment, but we can't tell when Dreamer will intervene.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Then let's sever communications among different Sangvis echelons first to prevent them from getting reinforcements.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：Agreed. The nearest communication outpost is around this area. Quite a large amount of data traffic.+Taking this base will do both SOP-II and ourselves good.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Understood.+Commander, please do us the favor of seizing the base.+We'll be on standby here until they finish their game of cat-and-mouse.
