RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Guys, we've got the supplies. Time to regroup! +The rescue party is about to arrive at the heliport! We'll just have to hang in there for a bit longer and make it through the Sangvis base-
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Heheh... Only "about to arrive"?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker><通讯框>;BOSS-9(0)||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:We've figured out the characteristics of encrypted Griffin signals. +You can no longer scuttle around under our noses...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:...nor break through our blockades head-on! +We've even come up with all the job delegation and defense stratagems! +Well? If you wanna surrender, I can consider keeping your neural cloud backups.

G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I-Is there no going home?
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut up. Is this really the time to freak out?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It IS a bit of a handful to engage two Sangvis Ringleaders at once...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:However... +I doubt they'd strike at the same time. +Someone has to guard the base and control the cannons.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That would be Architect. +If the rescue party can storm the base from the back... +UMP45, could you contact Helian?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Helian said the rescue party is still several hours away.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Tough luck... +How can we hold off till then...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:My, my... Are things really that desperate? +In that case, leave it to us...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You...?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Ja... +Aren't we the perfect answer to this kind of thing?

()||<黑屏2>:Five minutes later, M16 and RO635 are having a private conversation.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:(Whispers) RO, remember what I said.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How could that be? They're here to rescue us. +I heard that for Squad 404, the ends justify the means, but they have never failed.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:She is ONLY here to rescue US. +If you want everyone to make it safely to the heliport...don't leave everything to her. +Remember. YOU are the one in command.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I may not be as experienced as you, M16, but do you have to be this wary?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:If we're talking about the one with the foxy eyes, I'm actually worried that I'm not wary enough.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What about M4? What would she do?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:M4? She'd obviously listen to me. +Of course, you don't necessarily have to do that, but you must make your own judgment.
()||:M16 pats RO lightly on the shoulder.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +My own judgment... +(Laughs helplessly) As if T-Dolls can have such a thing...
