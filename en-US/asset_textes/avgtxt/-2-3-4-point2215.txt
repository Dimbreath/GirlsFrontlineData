RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:M16, what did Helian say about that heliport?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:According to Helian's intel, the flurry lets up about every fifteen hours. +The heliport will open for five hours during the down time for us to top up our supplies. +We must time it perfectly in order to do that.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll keep that in mind.
()||:【HINT】The heliport in this area opens once every three turns. It stays open for an extra turn before closing.
