RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><BIN>167</BIN>:That was easier than I thought... Did the enemies not have time to set up too many defenses...? +Maybe I should just seize the controls...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! RO, wake up!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is it...? I'm not completely done yet...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The white enemies! They're making their way towards us! +Have they discovered our location...?
??()||:<color=#00CCFF>Sheesh. Your guardian angel already told you not to touch that control panel.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Those morons laid such a pathetic trap and the prey that fell for it wasn't the rabbit they're after... This is turning out to be quite an amusing day.</color>
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A...forced transmission?! +Who are you?!
RO635(4)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The rabbits are gonna get roasted if they don't start running.</color>  +<color=#00CCFF>I never give away information for free, but I'll make an exception for you this time – you can pay me later.</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The transmission...is coming from a hidden passage in the sewers?
RO635(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you leave now, you might still make it out alive. It'd make my life a lot more difficult if you kicked the bucket just like that.</color>
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you our informant? Where are you?! +Dammit, the signal has already disappeared...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What do we do now? That was him, wasn't it? If we retreat now, everything we've done today would've been for nothing!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:In any case, we've got to move right now... +If the white enemies have this room surrounded, it'll really be game over.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, you still there? I'm really sorry but we require immediate support! +There's a special passage that can help us evade the enemies as we enter the sewers. Please cover our retreat! +And SOP-II, hand over your dog!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Dog? You mean Banana?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I don't care what it's called... I need to borrow it to retrace the informant's signal. +If he could force a connection with us, he can't be far from here. +We still have some time before the Commander's forces arrive. I won't let our efforts be in vain!
