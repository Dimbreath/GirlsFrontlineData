()<Speaker></Speaker>||<火花><黑屏2><SE1>Gunkill</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:In the theater ravaged by intense fighting.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Unbelievable... +Sangvis Dolls have grown even more powerful than before! +Is that a new model?
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:At least that particular Doll has never been sighted before. +There are no records concerning her in my database, so she could be a new model. +She must have exploited a loophole in the White Faction's defenses to have brought so many Sangvis units into the city.
AN94(5);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Even so, isn't this way too many? +Ange just said they're not doing well, so M4 could be having trouble too. +In any case...this fight is almost over. We'd better get ready.
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>96</BIN>:The White Faction is overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught. All the units around Mercurows collapse one after the other.
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>Mercurows</Speaker>||:...I didn't expect mere Dolls like you...to do so much damage. +Fine. If you're so dead set on getting your hands on these two unsavory pieces of meat, I'll leave them to you.
NPC-Mercurows(0);M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Don't you even think about retreating underground.
NPC-Mercurows(0)<Speaker>Mercurows</Speaker>;M16A1BOSS(0)||:Till next we meet, Sangvis Ferri and DEFY!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunkill</SE1>:Stop right there!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Mercurows disappeared into a secret passage and M16's bullets only managed to hit the locked steel door.
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Unfamiliar S.F. Doll</Speaker>||<关闭火花><SE1>Select</SE1>:Oh dear, just a bit too late, M16. +We aren't able to break down the door... What a shame—
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Unfamiliar S.F. Doll</Speaker>||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2><SE1>Gunfight</SE1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:My, my, don't Griffin Dolls have any manners at all?
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Sangvis Doll deflects the bullets AR-15 fired at M16 with a casual flick of her right arm.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:(She blocked the bullets with just an arm...)
AR15Mod(4);AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:What are you doing, AR-15? +Isn't that a member of the AR Team...?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AN94(2)||:Not anymore. +She stopped being our friend the moment she decided to join Sangvis Ferri. +The AR Team...is now nothing more than an empty shell.
AR15Mod(4);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Unfamiliar S.F. Doll</Speaker>||:Hmm, they're no fun at all. Kill them now.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:I don't recall handing you the authority to give orders, Beak.
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:M16, you make me worry so. +If it weren't for me, you'd have been shot - by a former teammate, no less.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:I didn't ask you to protect me.
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Humph, whatever. You'll thank me one day.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:That day will never come. +AR-15 from Griffin and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY.
M16A1BOSS(0);AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AN94(0)||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Drop your weapons before my forces smash you to pieces.
M16A1BOSS(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why should I?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:That's an order. An order sanctioned by absolute superiority in strength. +If you don't want to be reduced to a pile of scrap metal, obey me.
M16A1BOSS(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Do not hesitate, and do not think about resisting. +You aren't in the position to do so.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>AR-15, we're running out of ammo. If we fight them, the probability of our survival is zero...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ange already has our coordinates. We just need to buy ourselves time until help arrives.</color>
AN94(4);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>I understand.</color> +Fine. We surrender.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>172</BIN><黑屏2>:With Sangvis muzzles pointed at them, AR-15 and AN-94 discard their weapons and put their hands up in the air.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You've made the right choice. +Now bring me to the Pike Node.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I have no idea what you're talking about.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The signal of that Baptized affiliated with Paradeus, the clone that refers to herself as "Mercurows", was directly underneath this theater just a while ago. According to your signals, you stumbled into this theater as she was pursuing you. +I know what your objective is. If Mercurows hadn't chased you down to kill you for knowing where the Node is, why would you be here?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk...
Beak()||:As the saying goes, old friends make the worst enemies. You sure know your former teammate very well.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph, follow me. But I can't guarantee if I'll remember the way.
M16A1()||:You will.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:M16 points her gun at AN-94.
M16A1()||<黑屏1>:You'd better find the way, for the sake of your new friends as well as your old ones - before OGAS starts to get worse.
