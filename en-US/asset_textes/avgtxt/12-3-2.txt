RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:It's finally resolved... +M4, you really should reorganize your neural cloud storage properly when you have time.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sorry...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So can you continue with the memory fragment upload? I'm dying to find out what happened next!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You think you're binging some TV show...?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:For some reason this is ticking me off...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem... Now that the issue has been taken care of, let's resume the upload and stop wasting time.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right, I'll get back to work.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<回忆><黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:This is...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:The base layer of your neural cloud. Have you had a good rest?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Shake>||:Give me back...my body!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Have you calmed down yet?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You actually went ahead and did it... Has taking over my body been your aim all along?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I have absolutely no interest in your body. I'm merely seeking the answers to my questions. +That's why I couldn't stand by and watch as you resolved to destroy yourself. I couldn't let our journey end this way.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You had no right to make that sort of decision for me!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Ange, Task Force DEFY, and even Griffin survived the explosion. Look at this.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What's this?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Information that I gathered by hacking into the Military's comms network while you were wallowing in despair.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You mean... +The Commander and Ange...are still alive?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:That's right, they're still fighting tenaciously. +Yet here you were, about to do something unforgivable with your particle cannon.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +Give me back my body... I need to go back for them.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I'm very disappointed in you. Are you even capable of finding them?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I... +I can do it...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Your mental stability is compromised. You can't assess the situation rationally.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<震屏>:I said, I can do it!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Just stay here and be a good girl. I can't afford to let you fool around with your body. +When the safety of this body is secured, I'll hand the controls back to you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why should I believe you?!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You have no other choice.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<回忆><黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hacking complete.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:What took you so long?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:If you think I'm slow, be my guest and do it yourself. +Oh, sorry, I forgot all your ports have been sealed so you can do nothing except sit there and wait.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk... +So what's the situation? +Don't tell me you returned empty-handed.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:The search has been quite fruitful, actually. +Griffin has shaken off the Military and withdrawn from the city. Meanwhile, the Military's command system has been thrown into disarray because of the dirty bomb explosion. +Their armored units are amassing within the city. They seem to be searching for something.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Griffin broke free of the blockade?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:That does seem to be the case according to the communications logs.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I expect nothing less from the Commander. +Then the Military has probably mobilized to surround Ange.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:That is a possibility. +Do you think she's still alive?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Ordinary humans would've already become infected or even died, but Ange wouldn't succumb so easily. +Even if she got turned into an ELID, that woman wouldn't make things easy for her enemies.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(3)||:I see.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So what should we do next? Rendezvous with Griffin? Or rescue Ange?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:We must wait for the night to pass. It's too dangerous to operate while the snow is still coming down.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But we're running out of...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(3)||:If you fancy getting shot full of holes by the new enemies, be my guest.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk...
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:New enemies? What's that all about?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:I can faintly perceive a resonance with someone like Lunasia.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What do you mean...?
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bang! Bang!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<BGM>10106</BGM>:Was that from the basement?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are there more soldiers?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:...!
()<speaker></speaker>||:As if to answer M4A1, a low, beastly growl rumbled from within the house, followed by a furious slam on the door. +ST AR-15 raised her weapon and took aim. +The door got kicked open, revealing a small figure. +The once-white dress was now covered in blood stains, and even the messy hair could not hide the ferocious snarl that did not befit "her" young age.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:A little girl?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:What USED TO BE a little girl.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What...do we do? +Should we leave?
()<speaker></speaker>||:M4A1 said nothing. She just kept staring at the "little girl".
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Having finally broken free of her captivity, "she" howled once more and lunged at M4A1.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang. +ST AR-15 shot the mutated girl right in the center of her brow. +"She" slumped into the snow, no longer breathing.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You made the right call.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I don't need you to tell me that.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Poor human.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Was she a civilian who had been hiding nearby? Maybe her parents were dead, or they wouldn't have left her here all alone.
()<speaker></speaker>||:M4A1 walked up and closed the girl's eyes gently.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:She died of mutation.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...It wasn't her fault.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I know. +Come and give me a hand.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>6</BIN><Night><回忆>:Several minutes later. +M4A1 knelt on the ground next to a freshly filled grave. +ST AR-15 placed the dirty teddy bear and a bouquet of wild flowers onto the soil.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That should do it.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:... +A life was lost...just like that.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's the sort of world we live in. +No matter what it is that we want to protect, this will happen in the end.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:Is it always the same wherever we are? Will the strong always dominate the world while the weak are so casually slaughtered?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's why we must grow strong ourselves – so that we won't be the ones slaughtered.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I didn't know you were also capable of being so sentimental.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:I'm not so different than you.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +That may be true, but I still don't approve of you. +I'll cooperate with you for the time being, but only to ensure M4's safety. +I don't care what you're trying to do. If you don't return control over the body to M4 even after we're out of danger, I swear I'm going to kill you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sure, I get it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A civilian... +I didn't expect there to be any civilians left on the scene under those circumstances...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:The theater was right next to an abandoned town. A lot of refugees had been living alone in hiding within the Yellow Zone.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was our purpose to protect civilian lives... I can't believe we ended up dragging so many innocent people into this.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:So long as there is strife, we will never truly know peace. +Living has always been hard. Only those who survive have the right to judge what is right and what is wrong.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Shooting such a young ELID must've been devastating.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If I hadn't, the infected would've suffered even more.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have experienced the sensation of being exposed to Collapse radiation. It was as if my bones were piercing through my skin. My entire body was in agony - like it was being torn apart. +It must be even worse for those who are even more acutely infected. The only release for them would be death.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:I commend you for surviving that ordeal. +Surely you wouldn't want to experience that kind of pain again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Not if I can help it.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then let's keep going. We can only prevent the same tragedy from repeating itself if we complete the upload and find the information we need to repel the Military. +We don't have much time.
