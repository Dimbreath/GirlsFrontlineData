()||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Griffin's withdrawal is almost complete. +...The Griffin T-Dolls get in line to board the transports. They wave each other farewell, waiting to meet again at the new base.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Why are you still here, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:The Commander just issued another rescue mission in the current theater. +Anyone that wants to take part are free to stay behind.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I heard. That mission is a real dangerous one. Why are you going?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I didn't say I was. Some will go, some will stay. +I'm just taking in the view and...doing some thinking. +Are you going now?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I don't want to stay here a second longer. 9A-91 and Val can't agree more. +Oh right, 9A-91 said your friends are looking for you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:They're just my teammates. Our transport is probably here as well.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:So you're going, after all? Or are you just hiding from them? Or...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I'll make that decision myself. +But I need to think about...
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Don't take too long. This is the last transport squadron. Soon everyone will—
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:74U...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:I used to...be part of Griffin as well. +A proper elite T-Doll. I was actually the adjutant for a while.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Is that so...? +I have heard some rumors about you. Didn't know they're actually true.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Ja...then something happened... +I didn't have a choice, and I ended up...joining a renegade squad. +Dolls or humans, as long as I have my orders, I can harm them all.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I dislike those orders, but...there's nothing I can do... +And...my teammates...
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You like them, don't you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Even though I can't really fathom what's so good about them.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:At least they won't throw a fit if they can't get their hands on booze, right?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:(Chuckles) Indeed. But they have even worse habits.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I have two very good friends. In my experience, we became friends not because they're anything special... +Sometimes, the only reason is because we're together. It's all a matter of coincidence.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Coincidentally...I met three bastards.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:If you're still so uncertain, those three bastards must've been pretty nice to you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Do you want me to stay or not?

()||:...AK-74U smiles a little.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:No matter what your final decision is, I lived through a mind-blowing battle. I'm honored to have fought by your side.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:If you knew what I've done, you wouldn't feel that way.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Who knows, maybe I'd be even more honored? +See you around. Don't skulk alone for too long. Kalin will get worried.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I think you're more worried about her than me.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...416 gives her a casual wave and takes a look at her surroundings.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Now then... Time to get going... +Where...should I go...?
