M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO! RO, do you copy?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What is it? I'm a little busy here!</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:A human is walking this way. I don't know what she wants, but she's definitely coming straight for me!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Might just be some pamphlet distributor! I'll be done soon. Buy me some time!</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hurry! She's almost right before me—
()<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:You can't sit here, young lady!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Uh...why?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:Because a very important demonstration is about to take place here!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? Demonstration? About what?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:A demonstration against the government for reducing our sugar and tobacco rations for three months straight! +Also, the officials claimed that they'd be raising the immigration quota this year, but they still haven't delivered on their promise!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Uh...so...I have to move?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:That's right. Actually, you should just join us!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...I don't really want to take part in any demonstration. I simply want to sit here and watch these electronic cats fighting with the Shiba Inu.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:You should do more for the sake of freedo... Hold on, you...you're not human...!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I...uh... I-I'm a Tact— Uh, no, a civilian Doll?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:A Doll? A freaking Doll has the nerve to take up human space?! Scram already!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sorry, can't this wait just a bit? My friend is asleep.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:How dare you talk back at me, you freaking piece of scrap metal! Is something wrong with your toaster of a brain?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:As the woman raises her hand to slap SOP-II, the latter smacks her arm away out of reflex.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:AHHHH! MY ARM!!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oops... It got bent. I didn't adjust my strength properly...
()<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||<震屏>:There's a killer robot!! Arghhh, my arm!! Call the ambulance!!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Uh...I...
RO635-NoArmor(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What the hell have you done?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, you're awake?!
RO635-NoArmor(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let's go, the cops will be here soon! Run!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But that human...
RO635-NoArmor(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We're done for if we get caught! Go, go, go!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right...okay!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...Two minutes later, in a corner of the square.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I was gone for just barely a few minutes and look at what you've done... +Didn't I tell you to stay out of trouble?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I'm sorry... But that woman...these people seem to be very hostile towards Dolls...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Be thankful that we're working for a nice company. +I've taken several cases in the past – all kinds of abuse and violence against Dolls, sometimes even worse. You wanna know how those cases were resolved?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I want to. I'd love to resolve them myself...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You're not cut out for that line of work. What would you do, point your gun at the culprit's head? Most of those cases don't end like that. +Just do your current job properly. That's the least we could do to show the Commander and Kalina our gratitude.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I understand... So have you found the informant?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:What?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No, I haven't... +I've made a copy of all the footages taken by the cameras in this area, but I couldn't find the person in the photo.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:H-How is that even possible? Maybe you missed something?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I've checked three times. +But think about it – there aren't that many cameras around here, nor are they completely watertight... If the informant has undergone anti-surveillance training, avoiding these cameras wouldn't be that difficult. +He isn't the kind to expose himself too much to begin with. If he had planned his route beforehand, it would be hard to track him down... In the end, we have to go back to gathering optic records from Dolls...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Hmm... But there's got to be some clues... He must've left behind something. +RO, can you send me the footages? I want to take a look myself.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sure.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO draws out a transfer cable and plugs it into SOP-II.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Still, I'm fairly confident you won't find any...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:RO, look at this part! There's a brawl!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A brawl? There are at least 30 brawls captured in these footages.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:But this one was a bit peculiar. Look, several burly guys surrounding a maid with knives in their hands.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Mugging? That's pretty common in slums. +There were five cases of mugging and twelve cases of theft documented in...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:That's not the point. Check out the footage from the two other cameras overlooking this street.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hmm...I think I see what you mean...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Right?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There's no sign of the maid in them...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I've looked at all the footages from other cameras in the vicinity – the maid wasn't in them either, which means she was deliberately avoiding the cameras.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But the mugging derailed her plan... The route she had planned wasn't safe.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Now watch this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The men who had the maid surrounded reveal that they were armed with knives.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Smack! +All of a sudden, the maid crossed her arms and grabbed hold of a man's knife-wielding hand. +Meanwhile, she kicked another man in the lower jaw, then swung back around and jabbed the third man on the neck with her elbow. Finally, she pinned the first man onto the ground and punched him right in the face.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a matter of seconds, the unarmed maid has thwarted her human assailants.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You see?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Her strength and movements... This is definitely an illegally modded Doll... +What she did is impossible without advanced software and a high-spec body... +Even in Griffin, only a small number of T-Dolls have that kind of performance due to our limited budget.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Her movements, speed, and force applied when she beat those muggers were all carefully calculated... Even I couldn't have done it.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Huh? I thought you're an expert in close-quarters combat?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I'm an expert in tearing enemies apart, but I'm not capable of the intricate moves required to react that quickly while applying just the right amount of force to knock them out without killing them...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:In any case, there's our clue!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Humph. If we end up getting fired from Griffin, let's set up a detective agency together!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Huh... Can Dolls be detectives?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Who knows, maybe the Commander could secretly help us get our licenses?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Why are you assuming we'd get fired? Besides, our mission is far from over!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Okay, okay. Then what are you planning to do?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It'll be much simpler now that we know what to look for. The maid may be able to avoid cameras, but she certainly can't avoid being seen by all the Dolls out there. +We can extrapolate her course and even determine her destination with just a single optic record. +Now we just have to look into what the Dolls around these cameras have seen!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Sigh, we'll have to do it again and again and again...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So let's get to work, SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Argh... In the end, we're stuck doing this bother of a chore...
