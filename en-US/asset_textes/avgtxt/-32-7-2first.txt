Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Wow, I can see you're really mad from the state of their corpses.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I'm just anxious! I can't keep IDW waiting any longer! +Look, up ahead—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<BIN>54</BIN><黑屏2>:At last... +This is the Earth Computer. It's the first time I've seen it in the flesh.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Hurry up, you two! S.F. is still bringing in reinforcements and we can only help you hold out for a little while more!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hey! You said you could wipe them all out!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:And I also said that you shouldn't charge too far ahead!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:IDW...IDW!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Don't be hasty, shorty. You're really high up. How good is your balance?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I don't care! IDW's waiting for me—ah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:...Super-Shorty's hand slips, and she nearly falls off the outer wall of the Earth Computer.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Whew... That was close!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Haha, are you alright? +Ever heard of the saying "haste makes waste"?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I'm not as agile as IDW, but I can do it! And besides, nobody but me can crawl into that crevice!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Super-Shorty clings tightly to the outer wall and resumes climbing.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Looks like your small body is your advantage.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I'm not happy to hear that! +But if the circumstances demand it, I don't mind being shorter for the sake of a friend!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Super-Shorty comes to the narrow crevice that leads to the Earth Computer's interior.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,4</黑屏1>:I see it...the crevice that IDW used to enter. +I'm going—ahh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>0,2</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Crash! +...The section of the wall under Super-Shorty's feet suddenly gives way and she falls down!
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Shorty!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏><CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><黑屏1>0,0.6</黑屏1>:...!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>54</BIN><黑屏2>0,0.6</黑屏2>:... +You...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A slender hand from inside the crevice grabs Super Shorty's hand.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:You've gotten heavier, Leader.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<震屏>:IDW? ...IDW! How did you—
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Nya? Shouldn't the first thing you say to me be "Good morning"? +Everyone, please stop!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Whum—!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:The S.F. assault...stopped?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Haven't even had fun yet, Miss Captain?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Eh, it's like eating two pieces of sushi and then hearing the buffet is over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:So...how long was I asleep?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Three years. It's been three years since that day... +I'm sorry, IDW, it was all my fault.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Three years, huh... +I must have missed the endings of a lot of cartoons.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hi, excuse me, I know that I shouldn't be interrupting you two right now. +But based on my life experience as a native, allow me to remind you that you can actually continue your conversation after getting down from there.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:...Half an hour later, in the Core Elevator.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:So how are you feeling?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:It feels... Wow! The outside really is filled with sand! I remember this place used to be a forest! Was this all because of me?
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Thanks to you, the forest is completely buried in sand now. +Fortunately, the humans don't call the shots anymore, otherwise the environmental protection groups would have scrapped you the moment you stuck your head out of the elevator.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Hehe, well, it can't be helped, I slept for a full three years.
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Honestly, If I'd known you could have come out of the life pod, I would have just shouted for you from the outside.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Yes, I did wake up because you called my name. +Only Elisa would have been faithful enough to stay there. I just couldn't escape from among all those S.F..
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hahh, I got all worked up for nothing. In the end you came out all full of life and vigor.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Haha, well, my body's gotten stiff after three years of inactivity. +If I get some time later, I'm going to run ten laps!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:IDW...
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Nya?
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I'm sorry.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Ah? What's this all of a sudden? +All you did was keep me waiting for three years. It really doesn't bother me. You must have had your reasons, Leader.
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:No, I'm talking about the way I treated you before. +I took all my anger out on you and said a lot of things that I regret now.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Ah? Is that so? +I thought it was because you felt I wasn't good enough, Leader.
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:You did very well, IDW. You bought everyone the chance to save the world. +It's just that I'm terrible and don't deserve to be the team leader.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:But how could this team have been formed without you being the leader, and with me as the only member?
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Well you could just be the leader yourself, couldn't you?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Nah, a team with only one member would be finished the moment they made a mistake. +With two people, at least, there's a chance to salvage things like now.
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:...+You were the one who saved me, IDW. +When I had no idea what to do, you came up with a solution.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:So I did help out after all! It was my honor!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:(Sigh) Why don't you feel like I did something wrong?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:But...what's so special about doing something wrong? I'm used to breaking the rules.
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I really shouldn't have discussed this with you. Now I feel like a self-hating moron. +Ahhhhh honestly! Why did I end up as your partner!?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Leader, do you still hate me?
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:No, I never hated you. It's just... +When I'm around you, I'm either a bastard or an idiot.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Haha, that just means you're really compatible with me! That's how partners should be!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hmph, whatever. Besides, it looks like we'll need to keep working together for the time being. +In any case, this mission has gone on hiatus for three years. Are you still willing to complete it with me?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Of course, Leader!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:While you still have to call me Leader, add a "Shorty" to it.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Huh? Why?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Because my friends...get to call me that. +Al-Although, it's not like you're much taller than me or anything!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Ding!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:You have reached the surface of the Southern Hemisphere. Please ensure you have all your personal belongings and weapons.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yup! We're here, let's go, Leader Shorty!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,0.6</黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:Alma, Super-Shorty and the others are here, let's get started—
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||<震屏>:<size=50>IDW!!</size>
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Ngggh! Too tight, too tight!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Good thing you only sent two shorties over, otherwise our plan to save the world would have ended up as a free hugs conference.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:It's because these two were personally selected by me.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Because we were short, right?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Super-Shorty, even if I had to select for small frames, I wouldn't have sent a Dinergate or a Shiba Inu that was all talk on that mission. +I chose you because I believed that you would succeed.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:But Alma, I didn't think that I could do it back then...
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Well, what do you think now?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I've decided to believe in you, because you could always see the problems that I can't.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:I'm glad you finally realized that. +It isn't because we're smarter than you, but because other people are mirrors for ourselves. Super-Shorty, I could always find a way to fix myself from my family members.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Is that why you've been single all this time?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:I! D! W! Maybe you should have stayed in the Computer for a while longer!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Alright, everyone, let's begin. No, I should say...let's continue.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay, let's finish the mission that we couldn't complete three years ago!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>54</BIN>:...Alma walks in front of the Earth Computer.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:So it really does look like the picture that my big sister took.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Did your sister photograph the Earth Computer?
Alma(4)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:When I was young, I thought she was the coolest person ever, until she abandoned her kids for her so-called adventures and dumped them on my parents. +After that, I promised myself that I would never abandon my responsibilities to my family for any reason. +I haven't been able to find a boyfriend ever since.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:That just proves nobody was good enough for you.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:You're a real flatterer, Dana, although I know that it was my own fault. +But it was thanks to the interests that my big sister sparked in me that I can stand here today. +I've completely cracked Elisa. All we need to do now is to put her back into the Computer and we can give it orders.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:You work fast.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Why else would I chop off my real arms and replace them with prosthetics? +The human body is an obstacle. They will never keep up with the possibilities of the mind. +Come, which of you is willing to put Miss Elisa into the Computer and wake her up?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I think that honor belongs to those shorties over there.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:IDW, let's go.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Huh? I'm going too?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Well, you pulled Elisa out, so of course you're going to stuff her back inside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Super-Shorty and IDW pick up Elisa and insert her into the Computer.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Everyone! I've installed Elisa! +Elisa! Elisa, can you hear me? That's strange, why isn't she responding? +Hello, Elisa?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Geez, don't tell me you forgot to connect a wire or something. Let me take a look!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:That's impossible! I was trapped in this thing for three years! How could I misremember?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hm... It looks alright... +Wait a minute, do you hear that sound?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Tick, tock, tick, tock...
()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Huh? It sounds like...ticking...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:No...IDW... +This sound— +It's a bomb! Run! Everybody, run—!
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:What!?
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,4</白屏1>:Everyone! Get down—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2>0,4</白屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>183</BIN><黑屏1>:...BOOM—! +...
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker><Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>41</BIN><黑屏2>:(Cough)... (Cough cough)...! +Dammit, what on Earth... +Super-Shorty! IDW! Where are you!?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I'm fine, I'm fine! +IDW, are you alright?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:I'm fine! It's all thanks to Shorty's shield.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hah...if you had been any taller, I wouldn't have been able to cover you in time.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Whew... So what happened? +Why did the Earth Computer suddenly explode?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:If the Computer exploded, then wouldn't this mean Earth...
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Stay on your guard! There's someone in the center of the explosion!
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||<火花><CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay><BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Who...is that?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
Dana(2)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hey! Is this your doing? +Even if this city's a mess, setting off an explosion in a military base isn't too legal, is it?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...+Good evening, Miss Dana Zane.
Dana(2)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You are... +You're that "Anna", aren't you? +It's about time you told us what the hell you're up to, don't you think?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:As you can see, I have blown up the Earth Computer. +And I fused with Elisa's data and have materialized a physical body.
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Impossible...it can't be!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, there is no Earth Computer anymore. +Or rather...I am the Earth Computer now. Destroying me means destroying the last hope for Earth.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:What the hell kind of monster are you!?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I am God, the very last god in this world. +It sounds very chuuni, but everyone has the right to dream, right? And I simply made it come true.
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:I don't get it, how did you do it... +I checked Elisa! Her data was secure! You couldn't have had the time to fiddle with her!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Is that so? Then did you check your own computer? Didn't someone pay you a visit several hours ago?
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:What—
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Architect... +It's Architect! Her real master is Anna! She deceived everyone!
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:So you're saying...Architect's real aim in coming to the base was my computer!?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What else could it be? I'm just a pile of nanomachines. How could I politely ask to enter?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<震屏>:That [bleep—]! When I catch her again, I'll have a good enough reason to kill her three times over!
Dana(3)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Looks like I've finally got a good reason to throw down with her... +But still, you're the elephant in the room. What do you plan to do next!?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I intend to continue my plan, of course— +To destroy this world.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Why on Earth would you do that? What's so bad about this world?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, I think the world is pretty good as it is.+But that's only if you assume that... +This world is sufficiently real, and sufficiently stable.
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:What...did you say?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:There might not be a difference to you, but to me...it isn't quite the same. +Therefore, don't be too sad. As you know, you don't really need a concrete reason for wars and breakups. It's all because the ways in which people live are incompatible.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:..Saying so, Anna turns and walks back into the fire.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hey, you shouldn't be slipping away like this, should you? Or do you think you can just walk off like that?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What else would you have me do? Why should I transform or whatever before your eyes?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Anna snaps her fingers.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<震屏>:The White Knights... The White Knight mechs!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:They're coming again! How many are there!?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:There are as many as I want there to be. +You should know that since I am now the Earth Computer, I am both the one who gives orders and the one who executes them. +I don't need the sand, I don't need S.F., because now I can destroy the world in any way I want.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Prepare to break through! Let's get out of here first!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Bangbang!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I will cover Earth's surface with strawberry ice-cream, and then summon a chocolate straw the size of Lake Superior to poke through Earth's core. +But first, I'll cover the top ten peaks in the world with Swiss rolls, so I can fill in the blanks on my geography test paper with "egg roll". +Do you like that? Do you think such an apocalypse would suit a high school girl's backstory?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:How much time...would it take you to destroy the world?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:What happened to your sense of romance, everyone? Turning Earth into an adorable ice cream will only take a few hours. +I still need to think about the proportion of the cream, because I don't like it when it overflows. Although, enough to cover the entire North American continent will do.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Don't think you'll get away with this. We'll stop you!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Your former subordinates, those pathetic mechanical weapons, will stop you first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Escorted by the White Knights, Anna walks into the depths of the flames.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I'm going out for a walk, to take one last look at this world, at this civilization with no dreams or sentiments to speak of. +I'll visualize it as a big pile of dirty laundry about to be washed, and then imagine it all fresh and clean; wouldn't that be enjoyable?
Dana(2)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:We'll find you, Anna!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I know, I know, and I'll let you find me. +But do hurry it up. This city is far too fragile compared to the kind of waffles that I like.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><关闭火花>:...As the surrounding buildings collapse, Anna's silhouette vanishes into the flames.+...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:What...should we do...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Looks like you're in a hell of a fix too.
()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:Y-You are—!
Sei(3)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,3</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Hey...Captain Jericho, I'm sorry, we...
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Don't make that face. You couldn't possibly have screwed up more than I did.
Dorothy(6)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Um...thanks for your hard work, everyone, haha...
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Right, I know nobody's in the mood to hear me cheer you up.
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Prime Minister Dorothy? And...Stella! You're still alive!
Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I should be saying that... Looks like SOME good things happened today, at the very least.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Can we summarize our situation? +What should we do now?
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:We still have one last thing that we need to do.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Go on. The Prime Minister will pay me overtime.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:The person we have to stop isn't Anna... +...But Jill.
Dana(2)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Why? I thought you wanted us to capture Anna and save the world.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We are going to save the world... +But the world we can save isn't our own.
