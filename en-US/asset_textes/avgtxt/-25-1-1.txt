NPC-Kalin(8);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's too risky. They fire indiscriminately on all moving targets.</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:The Commander will come up with a safe route, but that'll take some time so hold on tight. +Also, don't expect too much supply. I'm sorry but our inventory is running very low...

NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:All T-Dolls in charge of defense are in key positions, just waiting for transport to arrive.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:The outposts were attacked by an unknown force. Our defense is stretched really thin...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:In any case, Miss Ange's intel is accurate. Enemy forces are relatively sparse here. I have also been supplying the defense teams you dispatched. Hopefully we'll make it till extration flight gets here...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Another mission for me? +The legendary "Not Found" squad? +R...right...if it's for a mission...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I have picked up their IFF signals. I'll input them into the command system so that our T-Dolls won't attack them—

HK416(0))<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you Fräulein...Kalina, the logistics officer here?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's me, alright... +Concurrently manning many other positions as well 'cause we're a bit understaffed here, haha...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:A physically induced memory loss is worth attempting, although such orders were never given.
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's good to hear, haha...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Have you not started the retreat?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We're still waiting for transport to arrive, but we don't know when exactly it...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:I trust the Commander has informed you about us?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, the Commander just briefed me. I was just about to input your IFF sig...
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hold on! I haven't done that yet, so how did you get in here?! There are six layers of defense lines out there—
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:So what?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:S-so... +So that's the reason you're known as the "Not Found" squad... +I finally understand why the other T-Dolls fear you so much...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:And you? Do you fear us, too...?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahaha...of course not! I'm sure those are all just rumors, haha...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Regardless of what you've heard about us in the past, we're just Griffin T-dolls seeking help today.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Right, I only know that you're an elite Griffin T-Doll, everything else is way above my paygrade. +And since the Commander has given the order, I'll do everything I can to help you. +But come to think of it, the Commander's exact words were, "Squad 404 needs your help", so where are your teammates?
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Pants) 41...6... +You were too fast...I can't catch up at all...
G11(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're too slow, Gr G11. Did you crawl all the way here? Where are 9 and 45?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:9 moved 45 to a temporary repair site...and Dier is doing a remote inspection on her... +Even if you're worried about 45, you didn't have to run so fast— Ow ow ow ow...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Stop spouting nonsense from your stupid mouth!
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Is this your teammate?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Kinda. This is Gr G11, our snipe—
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:She's...so cute! +How is such a cute T-Doll also on the "Not Found" squad?!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ugh...that doesn't sound like a compliment at all... +Why are all the humans I run into so weird...?
G11(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:How dare you say that... She's the logistics officer here, you know? +If she wants, she can remove your Imprint this instant and throw you back out onto the street.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>;HK416(0)||:Huh?! R-really?! Nein, nein, nein, please don't s-s-scrap me!
G11(3);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I won't. +Besides, only the Commander has the authority to order a T-Doll dismantled.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Phew... I see...
G11(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Look at your stupid face; you don't seem anxious at all. +Right, bring us to the repair site. Hurry.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Okay, okay! Stop kicking me!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Please come with us, Fräulein Kalina. We aren't authorized to allocate resources.

NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>161</BIN><黑屏2>:...Kalina follows 416 and Gr G11 to the temporary repair site.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are all those T-Dolls in the queue waiting for repair?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's right... The previous battle took a heavy toll on us. +On top of that, everyone's neural clouds lost connection to the Griffin's main server, making it impossible to upload their memory. +That's why I'm trying to at least restore their mobility so they can hold out until our transport plane gets here.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Griffin's neural cloud upload isn't functional right now, you said?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yeah... Our server has been very unstable ever since the Military launched their attack against us. +Then the massive explosion completely disconnected us. +We haven't been able to get in touch with either HQ or Helian... Our other echelons withdrew yesterday, only the Commander stayed behind...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Massive explosion... Was that the dirty bomb with Collapse Fluid...?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Dirty bomb?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:N...nothing. What's the status of the repair site?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Very bad... +We don't have enough spare parts, the only option for ones we can't repair is to have their neural cloud data backed up. +Even so, we can't guarantee all the T-Dolls can be backed up as we only have a limited number of data blocks...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:If that ends up being the case, you'll have to resort to physical backup...
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But that method—
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><Shake>||:...Whoa!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A T-Doll dashes out from the repair room all of a sudden.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sorry sorry, are you alright?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Even if I wasn't, I should be the one to apologize. +Kalin, do you know where AK-47's logistics team has gone?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh, 9A-91 asked for someone to pick up the wounded from her echelon so I sent them to carry out the mission.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Then I'm going over to help.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Uh, wait, you literally just came out of the repair bay—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AK-74U leaves paying no heed to her.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh...she left... +Uh, sorry, Miss 416. Where were we?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Is that T-Doll always so rude to you?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm used to it; everyone has their own quirks.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:You're okay with that?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well...I'm not the one on the frontline, after all.
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh, Gr G11! And 416! Where the hell did you run off to?!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416 found the logistics officer here. I almost died of exhaustion trying to catch up with her!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Just call me Kalin. Is this the injured T-Doll?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:That's right. UMP45 is our squad leader. She protected us from an explosion and took the brunt of it...
UMP9(2);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hmm...this is very severe damage... Please back off a bit. I'd like to inspect her condition.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:S-sure!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:This doesn't look good at all... Her torso support structure snapped into two; the right arm got torn off by shrapnel; more shrapnels buried in the other limbs... +I can't detect her power supply; are both the main and auxillary circuits damaged?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ja... The only thing still working is the backup power supply on the neural core itself. We've shut down most of her systems.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Is that so...? That's very decisive of you, but the damage is critical... +I don't recommend a repair, especially when the power supply isn't functional.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:How about a physical backup? At least that'll make sure we can transfer her data...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...A physical backup?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Fräulein Kalina has a few data blocks that can be used to store neural data. We can transfer 45's neural cloud in there for now and find a way to get her a new body...
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ugh... Wait...
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45! Didn't I tell you not to come out of hibernation mode? If you use up all the battery...
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No...I refuse.
UMP45(5);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Um... Miss 45, the extent of your damage makes repair very difficult. +Not to mention your parts... don't seem to be standard parts that Griffin uses. A neural transplant is your best choice at the moment.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Transplant... +You mean replacing this body...?
UMP45(5);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's the only way to save you. +It's not like you're more entitled to their already limited data blocks. There are a lot of other damaged T-Dolls here.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:No... +I can't...undergo a neural transplant now...
UMP45(5);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? But why, 45?! +Even now, you're still...
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:"That" chunk of data isn't stored in my neural cloud... If I'm moved to a new body...
UMP45(5);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do you wanna die, 45? +Isn't your life worth more than all of us combined?
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Sneers) Are our lives...worth anything at all? +In any case, this body...is more important than my own life...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, are you really...not doing it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...UMP45 struggles to shake her head.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:How about having 9 backup your oh-so-precious data? Data-sharing should be pretty easy since you're the same model, right?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:No... I...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:9, you won't be in combat for a while. You should have enough storage to—
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45 and I...aren't of the same model...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What...? +Seriously...just how many more secrets are the two of you keeping...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...416 lets out a sigh.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Whatever... Looks like we're getting a new squad leader.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Isn't that...what you've always wanted...?
UMP45(5);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What I wanted is to finish you off myself, not watching you die here like a piece of trash.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Ha... Don't worry, you'll have to wait a long time...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...UMP45 turns toward Kalin.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Fräulein Kalin...I know I'm being unreasonable, but I would very much like to keep this body. Please think of a way...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:A-alright, let me see if I can patch up the power supply system first... +Don't worry! The Commander asked me to do everything I can to help you, and I don't plan on letting you down!
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Danke schön... And please relay my gratitude to the Commander as well. I—

AK74U(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Not the Military? Then...they're the unknown enemies... Did they already breach the perimeter?! +...Commander! Do you copy? Our outpost were attacked!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:That's right, the attackers are currently storming our strongpoint! +There aren't many of them, but they've cut off communication between us and our defense echelons out there!

AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:What did the Commander say?
AK74U(0);NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Apparently new troops are coming to reinforce us, but it'll take some time for them to get here. +Right now, we need to organize a fireteam to help out the defense echelons out there, but our numbers... Who else is still operational?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I can still go; are there any other T-dolls still mobile?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A few T-Dolls step forward unsteadily.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Right, you lot come with me.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Are those the only T-Dolls we have left? That's a bit...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:If this place falls, we can't get out of here either.

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(8)||:Danke. Please also establish a direct line of communication to the Commander; I would like to acquire more combat intel.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh...? Oh, okay! I've set up an encrypted channel; it should be interfaced via your IFF signal now.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Direct communication with the Commander, eh? Not just any T-Doll gets such special treatment. +Who the hell are you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Just a Griffin T-doll temporarily back on duty. +You're AK-74U, correct? I hope you won't object to my involvement.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Why would I? We could use all the help we can get. +Just don't die too quickly, I won't mourn for you.

G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We'll be dashing about all the time. With your mobility...just forget it and stay here.

</color> +<color=#00CCFF>A fireteam has been assembled. Our main objective is to support the T-Doll echelons along the outer defensive line.
</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Griffin T-Dolls are garrisoned in three strongpoints at the moment. We have to help them repel enemy attacks and bring them back.
</color> +<color=#00CCFF>For now, our priority is to eliminate enemy units that are inside the wire before we can get to the defense line. The situation is very dire both in and out the outpost. Please give your orders.
</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Also, if you don't' mind, allow me to serve as your adjutant. I may not be a command-type T-Doll, but I can more or less coordinate a fight on the scene.
</color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Are you sure you find the arrangements acceptable?</color>
