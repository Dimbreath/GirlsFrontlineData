NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM><BIN>99</BIN>:Commander, we've succeeded in bringing back the T-Dolls from the other side!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:But none of them have seen the person who contacted us... +Stranger still, even the T-Dolls don't remember who saved them... +So I'm wondering, who on earth were they...
()||<BIN>99</BIN>:...A small drone lands near the base.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:That signal! It's news from the messenger! +I'll go take a look!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Mm..."Caretaker of Caretakers" says that the order with the highest priority is to retreat to the base in Area S11, and stand by for further instructions once we arrive there... +...Something like that.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Gr MP7 really did complete her mission. I hope she's escaped already. +So now we're the only forces still within the contaminated zone...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:...Yes, I'll send out the order to get our things ready and move out right away! +Ah...I know it's too early to celebrate now, but still...
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:When we return to Area S11...when we get everyone back together again... +We'll mount a counterattack some day, right?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏1>:...Yeah! I believe that too! Now, let's hurry and move out!

军方人类代表()<Speaker>Military human representative</Speaker>||<BIN>121</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Berezovich Kryuger. +I am officially placing you under arrest for involvement in the illegal trafficking of arms, the unlawful modification of civilian Dolls, and other crimes. +You have the right to remain silent...
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Even if silence is the only right I have. I know.
军方人类代表()<Speaker>Military human representative</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, I seek your cooperation with us to ensure the process goes smoothly.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Indeed. +It's all just a process, and it could not be going any more smoothly. +So don't be so nervous, young man. I'm only a criminal, not an enemy.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Rope</SE1>:Kryuger stands up.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Dispense with the formalities. I'm much more familiar with them than you are.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Illegal arms trafficking and unlawful modification of civilian Dolls... +These are pretty good crimes. +When I was still in uniform, I once told Carter that the one thing I didn't want was to be put on trial as a terrorist. +He's a cunning old bastard, but at least he kept his word.
