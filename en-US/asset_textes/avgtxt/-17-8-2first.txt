()||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Task Force DEFY continues breaking through the Sangvis units' lockdown and carries on to Squad 404's location.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I'm curious about something... when Ange asked you to rescue someone, were you disappointed when you learned it was Squad 404 that you'd be saving? +Not SOP-II, not anyone else...not even the Commander.
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Orders are orders. +Since we have to save Squad 404, then that's the most important mission given the present circumstances.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...Is that so. +Aren't you curious about what's going to happen next?
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>7</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:Ugh... +This feeling again...
清澈的声音()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Very well done, M4A1. +You're steadily returning to your original self. +You're not far... from home... Everyone can go home together, if only you're willing...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I once wondered if you'd come and bother me again. Are you still not ready to tell me who you are?
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:The answer only has meaning when you find it yourself. +If you're willing to seek it, then you must find your old self. +Build a connection to "her"...Everything begins from there.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You're...always hoping I'd do what you tell me to, aren't you?
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You don't understand the truth... +And I won't harm you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Prove it, then. +If you can help me find the location of SOP-II and M16A1... +Then I'll consider re-connecting with her, with your goddamned Mastermind!
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +I'm surprised, Tactical Doll M4A1. You actually stated terms of exchange of your own initiative.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:If you're as nice and friendly as you say you are, then help me now.
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +The coordinates... +Head towards...these coordinates.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Are these coordinates for SOP-II or M16? +My terms were for the positions of these two people.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I've already given you the coordinates... +If you want to find your friends...then hurry.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...M4A1 snickers at the answer.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Hurry? +Sangvis Ferri no longer has the initiative. You have no bargaining chips to play.
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:I can wait. Can you? +Answer me!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN><Night>:M4A1! M4A1!
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...M4A1's consciousness returns to reality.
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Sorry, I got distracted. What did you say?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I should be the one apologizing. I must have been too boring. +AR-15, explain the current situation to her.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Squad 404's present location is up ahead. +I guess Sangvis Ferri really doesn't like them. Just look at the how dense the encirclement is... +(Serves you right, UMP45.)
AR15Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:We're the ones who'll have to deal with them, AR15. +We'll start by cutting a path from the outer perimeter and easing the pressure on Squad 404...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...M4A1 notices AK-12 looking at her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:What is it?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I'm just curious about how things will look the moment when the AR Team's leader meets Squad 404's leader.
AK12(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点1>:... +We'll need to save them first for that to happen.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Squad 404, this is M4A1. +We've reached the outer wall of the central database's generator room. What's your status?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...Squad 404?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Oh my~ You're here at last. ♪
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:So you're the leader of the AR Team, or rather, the former leader...Miss M4A1.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...Is that...UMP45? +Just hearing her voice tells me she's dangerous...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Is AR-15 there too? How does it feel to be outdoors?
UMP45(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:M4A1 is now our leader. Hurry up and talk about the mission.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Fine, fine. Things aren't too good over here, but we can still traverse open ground.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Have you finished the mission Ange gave you?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I'd feel guilty about answering your transmission otherwise.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Gather your people. We'll be reaching the marked position in five minutes. We'll meet up there.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Evacuating after finishing your mission is very simple, M4A1... +But some scores need to be settled right away. +It's not just a personal grudge, but for the most part it's also planning for the future.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:What do you have in mind? +If it involves creating unnecessary complications, I'll pass.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Gager. +Did you know? The difficult situation you see now was fundamentally orchestrated by Gager.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Gager? +Don't tell me the Commander's engaged with her units...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:They're also the ones surrounding us. If you ran any trouble before this, it was probably them too.
UMP45(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I think Intruder is Gager's subordinate. She'll come up behind us soon and launch a pincer attack on us from front and rear.
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:(Then why did Gager ditch me and Squad 404 to fight Griffin's forces?) +Forget it... UMP45, are you ready to terminate her right now?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Ja, because I can do it. +Although, this plan will need your help. What do you think?
UMP45(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Tell me the plan and I'll decide.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I've sent it to you. The coordinates are already marked on the map.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...M4A1 checks her mail.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:...! +(I see...) +(Squad 404... No, UMP45...) +(Is this why you're so feared...?)
