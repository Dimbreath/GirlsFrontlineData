()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_va_synthestitch</BGM>:...After the operation ends, the Blitzkrieg Corps arrive at their destination, a warehouse.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Captain, look over here. +There's a hidden door, just like your intel said.
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:...The code authenticates and the door opens. The intel from Architect is right. +There's a passage heading underground, but signals are jammed inside. All we can do is go in ourselves and see what's in there.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:It's too easy. I know S.F.'s combat units aren't too strong, but could there be a trap down there?
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:It's certainly possible, which is why my neural cloud's already been backed up. +I'll go in and scout around first. Someone cover me.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:I'll do it, Captain.
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:We don't have the technology to backup a human brain. Someone else would be better.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:Yep, they all say that humans only have one life.+That's why we're not taken seriously by anyone.
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Sei, that's not what I meant.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:Dolls take risks knowing they have backups in reserve. Humans can do the same thing with the courage in their heart... +I joined the White Knights to prove that.
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:... +(Sigh) You know my concern isn't really about your safety, right? +To me, humans and Dolls are all single-use subordinates. There's no difference between the two.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:Thank you, Jericho.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Vice-Captain Sei, cover my back. Everyone else, stay out here and wait for orders. +Let's see if S.F.'s hiding their Mastermind down here, or if this is just some petty trick.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>70</BIN><黑点2>:...Ten minutes later, Jericho and Sei passed through the tunnel to reach the underground area.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:I'm not picking up any other signals, and there's no S.F. nearby. +Is this...a factory?
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:It's abandoned. Looks like nobody's been here for years.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:Which means this place really is a S.F. hideout. +Where's the Mastermind? Let's go find her.
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Careful. You may have ample courage, but you should still be cautious.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:I'm not a genius, but I'm no fool either, Captain. +Huh? Inside this hatch... +Captain, you need to see this!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:...Jericho and Sei fumble with the hatch and open it.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏2>:...
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:This is...
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:This is the highest-ranked S.F., Mastermind Elisa. +We've found her.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:She's...not moving?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Let me see... +...She's out of power.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>;Jericho(0)||:Eh? Out of power?
Sei(0);Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:She hasn't had power for three years, just like this factory.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:What? That's impossible! S.F. has clearly been active for the past three years!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Jericho does not answer. Instead, she continues to examine the Mastermind.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Her S.F. command module...had been removed a long time ago.
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:...+In other words... +The true culprit who's been controlling S.F. for the past three years wasn't the Mastermind. It was someone else this entire time.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:I'm afraid that's the case... +We fell for Architect's trick. Her secret master must've planted false memories to fool us. +What a petty trick... When I get back, I'm going to dip her face-first into Szechuan hot sauce and then find her master, the true culprit that took the S.F. command module!
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Sei, are you alright? +Don't be disheartened. All this means is that we've gone from the endgame to another stage in the investigation. We can still keep looking. +Since the abandoned warehouses became S.F. hideouts, if we find out who owns these buildings, we'll know who took—
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Captain Jericho... +Last night, Stella sent me a message.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:...And what of it?
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:She asked me... +"Do you still remember the place where we played hide and seek as kids?" +"Please help me keep this secret."
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:What does that mean?
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Jericho, I used to play hide and seek with Stella in this district when we were kids. +There were many times when I couldn't find her, because she always knew where to hide within these warehouses... +One day, she told me these warehouses belonged to her family...
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What? +Wait! Was she the one who took Elisa's command module!? +Stella Hoshii! She's the true master of Architect and S.F.!
()||<BIN>184</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><BGM>m_va_where_do_i_go_from_here_</BGM>:...Jericho hears the sound of a gun cocking behind her just as she is about to stand up, so she freezes.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Sei... +Did Stella ask you to point your gun at me?
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:No... +Because she knew...if she asked me to do anything like that... +Then myself from back then would never be able to agree.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:So...this was Stella's plan. +She ordered Architect to deliberately fall into our hands and then tricked us into coming here, where she would have you eliminate me...
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:I just felt something was amiss... I came down here with you just in case something happened, but I didn't expect that...
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:You didn't expect that you yourself would be that "something".
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Captain Jericho... +But being in my position right now, I don't have a choice... +I can't let Stella be captured by the White Knights. I have to...keep the secret...
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:You know what's going to happen next, right, Sei? +This place is completely blanketed by signal jamming. I can't upload my memories to a backup. +Once you pull the trigger, the next time I wake up I'll only remember stepping into this little shack, and I won't remember anything else.
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Yes, I know... +I'll come up with a lie to make you believe me.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:And I will believe you, because you're my most trusted subordinate, and my neural cloud was written by a goddamn computer program. +I will continue to be friends with the person who killed me, then go back to the bar and finish that drink I said we would have, and celebrate a hollow victory! Do you think it's fair, Sei? I have never been killed even once by S.F.! +Yet you're going to kill me to help someone in possession of Parapluie who might be planning at this very moment to endanger everyone in Griffin City!
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:I... I don't know... I don't want to do this either...but I want to protect Stella. She must have her reasons. +I'm not like you T-Dolls, Jericho. I only have one life, one chance... +For her, I will become any monster, take any risks, and do anything she asks of me!
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Are you really sure? I don't think you really dare to shoot me. You're getting too worked up, Sei. This isn't like you at all...
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:These are my true thoughts, Jericho! +I don't care about political perspectives, social debates, human rights and responsibilities, Dolls, humans, I don't care about any of that! +The reason I'm doing this...is simply because she believed in me. She believed that I would carry this out...+And all I want is...to do something for my friend...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Jericho falls silent for a while.
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:"Friends", huh. I've never really understood that concept... +If I were human and Stella were a Doll, what would you do?
()<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:...I don't know. +The "me" in that scenario wouldn't be the same "me" right now...
()<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's true... +Ah, friendship... Looks like it really is something only you people would believe in. +Now then, there's one last thing.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:You do know that when fitted with an Imprint, the speed of a Doll's gun draw... +...Completely outclasses that of a human being's, right?
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE2>:...Bang!
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:...Jericho?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Especially...when it comes to their mental state... +It looks like...you still weren't...calm enough...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Jericho collapses to the ground.
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Jericho...Jericho! +I didn't mean to! I...I-!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:It's fine... +It's okay, Sei...
Sei(0)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Why...Jericho... +I'm sorry...I...
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Now... Go do what you want to do... +It's alright...there are times... +When I also... +Want to do something...for a friend...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:......
