帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Do you...really have to go now?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yes.
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Your performance hasn't been fully tested yet, and it's extremely dangerous outside right now...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You know I have to go. +If you must stop me, disconnect me and shut me down.
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...I get it. You won't change your mind. +My private chopper is on the roof. The Commander will send you the battle coordinates...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Thank you...Miss Persica.
()||<黑屏1>:Tactical Doll M4A1 takes her leave.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏2>:As expected, her neural cloud has started changing after the restriction was removed... +Though this isn't really the time to ponder that.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Persica initiates a connection.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>System Notice</Speaker>||:...Connected.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:Oh my, is the sun rising in the west? Why else would Lady Persica contact me?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Don't play dumb. You left that beacon in the Sangvis database, didn't you?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:Haha, finally busted.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Since you know the address, I'm sure you've checked it out.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:The beacon is for returning a past favor. Does you no good to ask any more questions.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You still don't trust me?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:If you're just calling to catch up with me, then sorry, I'm very busy at the moment.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...Let's change the subject. +I found the surveillance file from back then. +But the drone was shot down in the contamination zone. I need the team to retrieve it for me.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:Can't you just send the AR Team?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Kryuger has transferred all the T-Dolls...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:All of them? +Damn, I look forward to seeing Griffin's next operation...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Are you helping or not?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:You can surely guess what actually happened even without looking at the file.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:... +Even so...I have to see it with my own eyes... +I'm sure you understand how I feel.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Sound Only</Speaker>||:Tsk... +Fine. But just to make this clear, the price is not negotiable. We're making a living here, you know.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As long as I have the file, name your price.

UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +This flashback again...
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Voice of a girl</Speaker>||:Electronic cache replacement complete. Neural cloud database sequence optimized. Neural consciousness returned to Level II. +Outdated internal encrypted file detected - awaiting command to backup, transfer, or delete.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:All denied.
稚嫩的男声()<Speaker>Voice of a boy</Speaker>||:It's a waste of space storing this antique in your neural cloud. Let me delete it for you!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Permission denied. Touch it and I'll tear off your limbs then throw them underneath tank treads.
稚嫩的女声()<Speaker>Voice of a girl</Speaker>||:Alright. Just leave it, Dier. Maintenance is almost over.
稚嫩的男声()<Speaker>Voice of a boy</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk, if that's what Sier says... +Okay, okay. Consciousness returned to Level I. We can now reactivate the body.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>70</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:It's finally over? +The maintenance took surprisingly long this time. How are you feeling, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Pretty normal, I guess. My body feels a lot lighter though.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Sighs) ... +Waking up in this grimy basement ruins my mood every time...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:When are you EVER in a good mood...? I for one had a really nice nap...
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry... We only managed to find this basement of this unfrequented cafe...
NPC-Seele(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Tsk, you shouldn't have to apologize, Sier! +Renegade T-Dolls like you should be grateful for even getting maintenance!
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Oh? Perhaps 416 misses the bright and spacious Repair Bay back at Griffin?
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who are you kidding, 9? 416's pampered body deserves something MUCH better than Griffin's Repair Bay. Like this place.
UMP9(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk... Not that I have a choice.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Alright, stop sulking. Have you seen my jacket?
UMP9(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;HK416(0)||:...Beep beep beep.
UMP9(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:Oh, just a moment... We're receiving a call.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:Whoa... Don't tell me we're getting a job right after maintenance...
G11(2);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:New electronic interfacing protocol upgrade pack transfer initiated. Download in progress... +Um... The boss requires all members of Squad 404 to have it installed.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:What...does that weirdo want us to install this time...?
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:As always, is she gonna tell us only after the installation?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Okay stop complaining and lie down. I'm gonna move your consciousness back to Level II again.
NPC-Deele(0);UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hurray, Gr G11! Another nap~
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(3)||:Sigh... But I have a feeling it's gonna be a nightmare...
G11(2);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Prepare for consciousness transfer - three, two, one, begin.
德尔()<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Right, you know the rules. Enjoy the game!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sigh) I knew it...
