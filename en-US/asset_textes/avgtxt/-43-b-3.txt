()||<BIN>288</BIN><黑屏2>:... +In the Dark Zone.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Ah-choo!
()||:AK-47 rubs her nose. She has been waiting here by herself for a very long time.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:A-91's taking so long... What's up with her, anyway?+Come to think of it, she sent a radio transmission just now. Wonder what that was all about?
()||:...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Eh, forget it.+Tsk. Seriously... It's not a good habit to keep people waiting.
()||:Thoroughly bored, AK-47 kicks at a nearby stone.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...Don't tell me something happened to her?+Did Vivi intercept her when she was taking the roundabout route?+She wouldn't be so dumb, would she?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker><Shake>||:Gwah! +W-what was that?!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:X Honey Muffin died from an explosion.+X Chain Charge 81 died from an explosion. +X Dazzling Mouse Tamer died from an explosion. +X Candy Cannon died from an explosion.+X Abzolut Vodka died from an explosion.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ehhhhh?! Isn't that A-91?!+How did she get blown up?+And she went out along with a bunch of other guys whose names don't sound like they're drinkers...
()||:AK-47 sniffs at the air and looks in the direction of the other Dark Zone exit.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:It must have something to do with that explosion just now.+Was it that way?
()||<黑点1>:After a brief pause, AK-47 shakes her head and runs toward the source of the blast.
()||<黑点2><BIN>299</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...What the hell is this?
()||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene1</BGM>:Ground zero of the explosion is unexpectedly close to AK-47's position.+However, when AK-47 arrives, all she sees is countless pillars of multi-colored light all over the ground.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Did I accidentally stumble onto Ali Baba's secret trove or something...+Ah, speaking of which, five people died here, right?+Did they drop these items?
()||:AK-47 approaches the pillars, and ISAC just so happens to chime in to remind her to restock on supplies.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Cy...+Did they rob a hotel or what?
()||:Most of the multicolored drops are food and water, with the occasional bit of ammo.+Also, there's...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Er... +I guess these things belonged to A-91. +And SKS' stuff is also...
()||:As she looks at her instantly-bulging backpack, inspiration strikes AK-47, and her half-drunk mind suddenly arrives at a terrifying notion.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Could this be a gift from the Fairy Queen?!
()||:... +Of course not.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:... +So I'm the only one left, huh.
()||:Her squad had been a rowdy, lively bunch just a few hours ago, but in the blink of an eye, she is all alone, muttering to herself.+The buzz of alcohol hasn't fully faded yet, but AK-47 is starting to feel empty inside.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I don't know what I should say, but don't worry, comrades.+I'll make it to the end for everyone's sake.+All this is for the Moscow that stands behind us!+YPA!+Also, for ten million dollars' worth of vodka!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>288</BIN>:Haha, I don't know what's going on, but...+I suddenly feel like I'm going to win!+At times like these, a professional Tactical Doll like me can grasp the situation with a glance.
()||:As she cleanly and efficiently eliminates the rogue agents in her way, AK-47 is filled with surging euphoria.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ka-chak.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:I didn't know there were so many supplies in the Dark Zone. There's such an abundance of ammo even I'm starting to think it's a bit excessive...+There's no way I can lose! I've practically won! +Ahahaha! I feel great— Hey you! Don't run!
()<Speaker>Rogue Agent</Speaker>||:...!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ohoho, that was a surprise. +How dare you screw around when I'm having fun, you little bastard!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang!+AK-47 pounces like a great white shark savaging a shoal of fish as she directs hails of lead and streams of fire at every moving target in sight.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's how it should be — now THIS is a game!+Hahaha! Oh, this is nowhere near enough! Come on, bring it on!
()||:A stunning scene is playing out.+AK-47, endowed with an extraordinary amount of supplies, is tearing right through the rogue agents roaming the Dark Zone.+Chocolate bars!+Canned rations!+Mineral water!+Soda!+Incendiary rounds! Explosive rounds!+Thriftiness! Economization! Stockpiling!+None of these mean anything to AK-47! At this moment, she is the reigning Lord of War of this land!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Now! Who's hunting who now? Ahahaha! +Oi, Dima, Dima? Miss Dima?
()||:There is no response from the system or the comms.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Tsk, she's ignoring me.+So what should I do next? I was supposed to find something, right?+Ahhh, forget it! Who cares? I'm as high as a freaking kite right now—！
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ahahahaha! Come on, run faster, piglets! Run back home to your mama!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!+A sudden explosion puts a damper on AK-47's revelry just as she's about to reach a climax.+In the distance, a group of rogue agents suddenly swarm out of the rubble, opening fire as they move.+They seem to be chasing someone.+As she sees the figure leading them, AK-47 suddenly freezes in place, as though she had suffered a system crash.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm? ...I'm not seeing things, am I? Is that a Doll over there?+And she's kind of familiar, isn't she?
()||<黑屏2>:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't push it, you lot!+Tsk! If only I had more ammo...<下雪></下雪>
()||:She might have taken down the most fearsome foe of all, but the flood of unrelenting foes is still hot on 416's heels.+Overwhelmed by the opposition's numbers, 416 can only mount a fighting retreat, but even after expending almost all her ammunition, she still can't shake her pursuers.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I can't let this go on...</color>
()||:416 knows that at this rate, they're going to grind her down into nothing.+The only way to reverse this outcome is to reuse her previous gambit of turning things around with explosives.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The explosives are ready, but I need to gather up the enemy...
()||:416 nimbly darts through the enemy hordes, her movements swift and dexterous.+However, she does not know that her skillful display is pouring gasoline on someone else's burning heart.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:This is it, this is it! +This is a chance to really show my stuff!+I'm tired of these suckers! It's about time I faced a worthy opponent!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:YOU! Da, you!+While I don't know who you are...but I won't let this chance go!+It's not right, don't you think? Fighting all this way and not killing a single player?!+You over there! I don't know you, but I'm sorry to say you're going to be my first prey! +—Don't hold it against me!
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ka-chak.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Here! Comes! A! K! 47!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang!+AK-47 smashes into the enemy horde like a juggernaut, firing with wild abandon.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Yet another lunatic!+Is there no end to them?!
()||:416 freezes up for a moment, and when she recovers, she also hurriedly cocks her rifle.+She has no desire to begin trying to communicate with the rampaging bull that is AK-47.+More to the point, the massive stack of buffs radiating from her means that she is definitely not someone 416 can fight.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What— Wait, wait! +That's—!！
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hahaha! Too late too late too late! Kneel before me!+I'm going to eat you up, milashka!
()||:No obstacle can stop AK-47 as she sweeps down on 416 like a storm, intent on devouring her in an instant!
()||:—Click.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()||:..Her wild laughter suddenly cuts off.+It is as though someone has taken a still photograph of the scene. Not even 416 manages to react to what has happened, given that her finger has just tightened around her trigger.+AK-47's blacked out brain instantly comes to its senses — the strange sensation under her feet has awakened a certain reflex in her.+With just the slightest contact, she realizes exactly what has happened.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:... +...Cyka blyat.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:X Smirkov Red Label died from an explosion.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's where I set my trap...+...I was going to say you ran into the explosives I planted.
()||:As AK-47 is blown sky-high, countless pillars of light begin falling back down to earth.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Still, I'm saved!+So thanks, weird stranger!
()||<黑屏1>:...
