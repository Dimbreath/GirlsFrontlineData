92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_SpecialOPS</BGM>：No fun...+I still remember the first time your pigtails literally stood on end...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Jeez...+I'm not AAT. I won't fall for the same trap seven times a day.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Are you there yet?+Sten's also in position. Then let's hack into the mortar!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker><通讯框>||：Hmm... RO, this hacking program...is kinda hard to get my head around.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||：There does seem to be a few problems. The operating routines need a bit of tweaking.+I've sent the set-up to you guys. Adapt to it quickly.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：The hacking program was originally the work of Sangvis Ferri. We were short on time so this is the best we could do with it.+Hurry up and get this over with. We're running out of time here too.+M16 and Makarov are going after SOP-II, and I'm worried that Dreamer will unleash another round of barrage.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||：Is she...mad enough to blow herself up?

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Their Mastermind is never one to shut herself in a lab. She's been learning and improving her craft.+Both Dreamer and Jupiter are her new toys...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||：If we manage to hack into the system, at least we won't be sitting ducks when going against the latter.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：True, but it's gonna be a bit of a chore...+We'll have to take over all the bases around the mortar before we can initiate the hack...
