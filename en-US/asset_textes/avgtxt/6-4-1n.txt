 ()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><Night><BIN>3</BIN>:Twenty minutes later, the remaining members of Team FF rendezvous at the temporary outpost.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:FF FNC still hasn't returned with T91?
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Let's wait just a bit longer... She said she'd be here in ten minutes max. +And I'm sorry, 57, but to be honest... +I'm not entirely sure...whether our targets are actually safe at the moment...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:I know, but don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. We should focus on the task at hand. +Oh right. Mark down all the locations T91 mentioned before and prepare a report for our next correspondence with the Commander.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Already on it. We've...run into this kind of situation a lot.
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Well done, 49. You really ARE experienced. +Once they've confirmed the final location, we'll be off. +The night is almost over. It's game over if we alert the main forces of S.F. again.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:I envy you, 57. You're unexpectedly chill even now.
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:It's just that I'm a sore loser. It's clearly something I can do. I don't want to give up just like that.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Haha, how reliable. Sometimes I think you're also a suitable candidate for the position of team leader...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Are you serious? Well, not that I disagree... +Besides, FAL's careless and frivolous ways don't really sit well with me.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:But Team FF wouldn't have achieved so much without the support you have for each other, right?
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Oh? What makes you think so?
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I have a feeling that I'm only doing better than I usually do precisely because FAL is the leader... +Because she fills in the missing piece of my neural cloud...the piece that I yearn for so badly but can never possess. +Could that also be the case for you, 57?
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Humph... +You may be all meek and demure, but you actually have quite a lot to say, don't you?
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:(Chuckles) I'm sorry. I've said too much. +Besides...I know full well that I won't ever participate in Team FF's operations again after this one...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Do you like Team FF, 49? Would you like to keep working with us?
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Of course I'd love to experience more interesting things. But a T-Doll like me is hardly qualified...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Heheh, rein in that self-consciousness, 49. You're the one to decide whether you're qualified.
 ()||:Five-seven rests a hand on FF FN49's shoulder.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Not to mention, our recruitment policy isn't based on whether you're qualified, but whether we need you. +Think about living through the night first. I'll see what I can do for you and FF FNC afterwards.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hey, we're back! Are you ready? +The last location was a bit hard to find, but thanks to T91, all locations have been confirmed!
T91(0)<Speaker>T91</Speaker><通讯框>||:Don't mention it. I'm very glad my experience from the time I spent in hiding proves useful. However... +I've lost my weapon in my previous battle and all my energy is pretty much spent. +I'm afraid you're on your own from now on.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;T91(0)||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:No problem, T91. Merci beaucoup. We're extremely fortunate to have run into you tonight.
FN57(0);T91(0)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I don't think it's a matter of fortune. +I couldn't have escaped if it weren't for a companion on our team.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;T91(0)||:Oh? Who is she? What happened?
FN57(0);T91(0)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Well... +Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter now. It's just that I want to thank her in person. +So please, get everyone out!
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:We will, T91. Thanks for all your hard work. Take a proper rest. +49, FF FNC, report everything we've learned to the Commander and come back with a battle plan ASAP. +I'm gonna make some adjustment on my command module to maximize my efficiency in leading this operation.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Will FAL...be okay?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't think about unnecessary things. We just have to complete the mission she's assigned us. +Get ready and let's go.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Five minutes later.
FNFNC()<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Commander! Commander! Commander!!
FN49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Hey, don't scare the Commander.
FNFNC()<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Is this really the time to worry about such things?! +Commander-der-der-der-der-der-der-der-der!!!
FN49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Why are you stuttering, FF FNC...?
FNFNC()<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Quoi?! It was just an echo! +See? That woke the Commander!
FN49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:I don't think it's because of the echo...
()||<黑屏1>:...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2>:Commander! Got enough sleep? We're about to set off! +We've finished compiling all the locations where missing T-Dolls are being held captive through an infiltration. +Now our objective is to rescue them as quickly as possible, Commander, and that depends on you! +Heheh, you've worked all night with us. To show my gratitude, I'm inviting you to join my next chocolate party!
FN49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Umm...Commander... +I beg you to reconsider participating in a party that only involves watching FF FNC wolf things down... +Anyway, thank you for being with us tonight... +We are all set. Please give your final order for the night!
