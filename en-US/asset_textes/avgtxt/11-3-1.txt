()||<Night>:The time is 19:10. Somewhere in the residential area of Belgrade.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:SOP-II, how is it going?
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I've gathered optical data from 200 Dolls and finally found her...
RO635-NoArmor(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Thanks, SOP-II.
RO635-NoArmor(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sigh... You know what's the hardest about this? Your order has allowed me to see all sorts of...mind-blowing things...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Well...these are civilian Dolls after all... Let's have your analysis.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:These records were taken from around an hour ago. I've strung together all the footages that revealed her whereabouts. You can watch them all in one go.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Good. I'll also send you what I've found out. This way, we should be able to predict her actions and plot her course. +Look, to the right of the red convertible by the road. That's the maid, right?
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's her alright. Check out the next footage. +She's still moving. I wonder if she'll eventually lead us to our informant's residence.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:If the informant is this cunning, it's unlikely for the maid to randomly pop home.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:It doesn't matter. Let's just get a handle on the way she operates for now and track her later. The informant will give himself away eventually.
()||<黑点2>:...Five minutes later.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO...have you finished going through all the records?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Yeah...something's off...
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Doesn't that convertible look familiar to you?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Not just familiar. This is the very same car we spotted her with earlier... +That maid...she's been walking through different streets, but she's just going around in circles.
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But why? Some kind of weird strolling command?
RO635-NoArmor(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:In my experience, there's only one possible explanation... +She realized that she's being followed. Informing her master would expose him, but she can't stray too far from the residential area and risk being abducted. +So she's trying to find a way to lose her stalkers, but since she keeps getting intercepted, all she can do is go in circles and look for possible openings.
RO635-NoArmor(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:She noticed us? That's impossible. We've only just started gathering data, and this must've been an hour ago.
RO635-NoArmor(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:I don't think it's possible either, which means... +Someone else is following her.
RO635-NoArmor(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? You mean...we're not the only ones after her?
RO635-NoArmor(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:That's very likely. We can't be the only ones who want information...though our fellow stalker is probably no friend of ours.
RO635-NoArmor(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No matter who they are, we can't let them get their hands on the maid!
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:You're right. We should locate our competitor and get rid of them before they notice our presence.
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Do you want a tip?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:You know something?
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I just accessed the public network through another Doll. +That way, I could widen our search parameters and keep an eye out for any suspicious persons around.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:You got our stalker? I suppose spotting them by the eye is a way to go at it.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Look, on the left, between the fire hydrant and the homeless man, there's a guy in a big coat playing with his PDA. You see him?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Yeah. What about him?
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:There's something odd about the way he moves.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Yeah...there tends to be a very minute sense of delay when it comes to human movements. This could be a Doll masquerading as a man.
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You think so too? He's been moving naturally enough in between these streets, but from his tracks, he's been maintaining a very steady distance from the maid.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:I didn't expect...that you'd notice something so obscure.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Humph, my senses are really keen, you know. I'm an excellent tracker!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:This does seem to be your strong suit, but are you certain? He isn't moving very fast. At this rate, he'll lose her very soon.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What if he doesn't have to worry about catching up?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:...I see. There are more than one of them and they each have their own route. +They're slowly drawing in the net. The maid will find herself trapped in the end.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:A cliché but effective way to capture someone. +Should I sniff out all the stalkers one by one?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:No, that would take too long, and there's no telling if we missed out anyone.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then... +Fourth floor to the right, someone there has been observing this area the whole time. He's hidden behind the curtains but I can still faintly sense his signal. +It could be the Doll in command... I'm not the best in electronic warfare. He might become aware of me if I force a connection, so why don't you give him a try?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Got it. +I'll just have to hack into this Doll and track down the others through him. +Leave it to me. Keep an eye on the maid.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Just keeping an eye on her isn't safe enough. If they decide to make a move, we won't get there in time to stop them from snatching the maid.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Then... Still, it's too risky to expose ourselves right now.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'll pretend to be a normal pedestrian, just like them, and I'll inch my way closer bit by bit... +You can create an opening for me to lead her out of their encirclement.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Right... Try to lead her back to the square we started on. That will make it difficult for them to go after her with more people around. +We can throw them off our trail in a crowd... given that the maid is willing to trust you.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That won't be a problem. You can tell just from the way I look that I'm on the side of justice!
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||<黑点1>:From just the way you look...? Hard to say...
()||<黑点2>:... +SOP-II sets off from the corner and stealthily moves toward the street. +RO635 activates her electronic warfare module, which turns the whole area into a simulated cyberspace.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let's start with...our first stalker.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...RO635's avatar climbs onto the roof of the building their target is hiding in.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>Doll tracker</Speaker>||:The target has shaken me off for the 23rd time, but she is still within the same area. +Query – should we adjust our course of action?
RO635-NoArmor(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That signal...
RO635-NoArmor(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hold on, they're—!
RO635(5)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Dammit...
RO635-NoArmor(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Why...why do they keep showing up wherever we go? +Is it a coincidence...? No, that's impossible... Are they after us or...
Doll tracker()||:Acknowledged. I shall keep observing the target. I will not deviate from the plan unless the target repeats her action for another seven times.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There's no time to investigate. I've got to stop them... +I can overload this Doll and make it look as if he crashed, but if I don't break his external connection, remote diagnosis will restore him very soon. +However, if I destroy him completely, his collaborators will realize someone's helping the maid, which will put her in even more danger.
()||:Pzzt...pzzzzt...
Doll tracker()||:...? Report...my...
()||:Pzzzzt—!
Doll tracker()||:Nothing out of the ordinary. Everything is within normal parameters.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Got it!
RO635-NoArmor(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, do you read me?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What is it?</color>
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I've hacked into their Level II. It's the White Faction. +There are more of them than I thought – we certainly won't stand a chance if it comes to a fight. +However, I'm going to disable one or two Dolls barricading the intersection. If the maid is quick to catch on, she'll definitely find the opening.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then I'm gonna cover her exit and prevent the enemies from ambushing her?</color>
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Exactly. I'll find all her stalkers and plant a backdoor program in them that can trigger an overload. +When you're making a run for it, I'll overload them one by one. By the time they realize they've been hacked, it'll be too late.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger that! And as soon as we're out of danger, I'll apprehend her. We have a LOT of questions to ask her!</color>
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good. Then let's get started!
