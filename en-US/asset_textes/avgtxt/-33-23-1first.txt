()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_stage5</BGM>:UMP45 stands up. Her surroundings are pitch black, but she can still make out writhing figures from within the fog. +Like undersea monsters crawling out of a black tide, these figures slowly but surely begin moving towards 45's landing site.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Are these offensive firewalls? If that's all there is to you, you can't do anything to me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:UMP45 opens fire at these thoughtforms. The shattered thoughtforms scatter like ashes, but wave after wave of them flood out, nearly drowning her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk, as I thought, that couldn't possibly be all... I've got no choice but to escape, huh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Bangbang! Boom—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At that moment, UMP45 has a hard time telling if the explosions are really as loud as they sound to her. +Flames burn a path through the thoughtforms, while the black space seems to eliminate all sound, as though it were a silent, distant sky. +After the light and shadows shrink back, it looks like nothing had ever happened. +UMP45 hurriedly dashes through the scorched path and runs forward.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Looks like 9 and the others are still thinking of ways to assist me. I need to obtain more data.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:After running through this unknown space for some time, the scenery around UMP45 begins to change.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Have I shaken off those offensive firewalls?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:Why have you come here?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Wha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The black space seems to have a border to it, and when 45 walks in front of a half-hidden door and pulls it open, the blinding white light makes her squint out of reflex.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Tsk!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:When she manages to make out what she's seeing before her, she freezes for a moment.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><白屏2>:It is a virtual space like the one she saw on Level II, filled with countless girls who strongly resemble M4 in appearance. +Countless pairs of empty eyes stare right at 45.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:45 subconsciously takes a step back, but the door from earlier has vanished.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:At least I managed to find something that looks like her...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The M4 look-alikes swarm toward UMP45 like the thoughtforms from before, and the girl in the lead walks up to UMP45.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why, why are you among us? +This, is not a place you can enter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 shrugs, but her fingers grip her gun tighter.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:You're not the judge of whether or not I can be here.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You, are not worthy, of being here. +Get out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the girl finishes speaking, UMP45 is sent flying before she can raise her gun. +The horde of girls surrounding her also start attacking UMP45.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You think I'd just leave because you tell me to...? +I haven't even figured out—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The opposition's attacks show no sign of abating despite what UMP45 said. They simply surround her slowly, like machines carrying out an order. +They try to touch UMP45, and the places on UMP45 where they make contact begin to slowly disappear.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is bad... They're much more troublesome than those thoughtforms... +Plus, they're directly rewriting my neural cloud operating instructions. Are they preparing to completely consume me here...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sudden explosion causes the horde of mysterious girls to stop attacking for a brief second, and 45 takes the opportunity to duck aside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zzzraaa—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:At this moment, there is a response from 45's communicator. +The voices of Squad 404 are carried intermittently over the sound of electrical buzzing.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You dummkopf, where the hell did you run off to by yourself?! Do you know how overheated your body is right now?!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>All of our neural clouds are being tied up in maintaining this bloody transmission with you and we even have to help you take down this damn firewall attack!</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...If you've got the time to scold me, then just help me get rid of this ridiculous defense system.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We can't! Do you know how hard M4 is trying to restrict our connection?!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You need to get out right away... This is all we can do!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The audio transmission cuts off, and 45 doesn't have the time to wonder if it was because of the firewalls or if 416 hung up. +She has only a moment's respite, then the attacks from before resume in full force.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>45! We should be able to block their attacks for a few seconds, try forcibly logging off!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:9's voice is accompanied by the enemies lurching unnaturally at her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(But I haven't found what I want yet...!)
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>45, can you hear me?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Disconnect — zzraa — neural cloud!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'll try my best to disrupt their attacks—</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(I can't just give up like this!)
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>45! Can you hear me?!</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:9, hurry and contact the Commander. These are the memory fragments I managed to intercept just now...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But what about you?!</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:I can't — zzraa — leave yet — zzraa
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>157</BIN><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:45!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Her voice is no longer interspersed with the sounds of static. The members of Squad 404 crowd around UMP45's body, each of them staring at her.+They are surrounded by dim light, the stench of corpses, and damaged, stained stone walls.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What...what should we do...? She's not moving...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is this the end...for 45?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You guys...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hm?
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Shut up! 45's just trapped in there! Take care of her body! +This is the information that 45 tried so hard to send to us... We need to inform the Commander right away; I'm sure the Commander will have a way to bring her back!
