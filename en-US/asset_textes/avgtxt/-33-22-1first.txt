()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:At the same time, on the other side of Tallinn.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zzzraa—
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hey, 45! Can you hear me?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:9's communication signal suddenly goes through, accompanied by the sound of an intermittent electrical current.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja. +I didn't expect you could re-establish the connection. +While you're at it, 9, help me record these—
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uh... 45, are you still...inside M4's Level II —zzzraa— layer?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I can't...maintain neural cloud consciousness —zzraa— in there...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm just barely able —zzzz— to speak with you...through basic audio...</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like it's very hard to keep it stable even if we came in through a backdoor. It's alright, 9, just leave it be. It would be bad if M4 found us. +Just help me record these images.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:UMP45 cautiously and slowly moves through the white region of cyberspace. She sees M4A1's afterimages and the girl holding M4's hand. +These images soon vanish before UMP45's eyes like popped bubbles.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>195</BIN><白屏2>:UMP45 stops walking and looks around, then she strides in the direction where M4A1 has vanished. +UMP45 comes to a halt. At this moment, the signal that UMP9 is monitoring suddenly goes out of control.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I can't believe the space inside M4A1's neural cloud is so massive... It's so big it defies common sense. +Can a single Doll really handle so much neural cloud space? Or is this space not installed in her? +What is this place? Why does everything here look upside down...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Sunlight cascades down through the gaps in the trees' shade. The inverted trees are weird, yet captivating. UMP45 can't help but admire them.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<白屏1>:M4A1's internal cognitive logic is a mess, but you can't tell at all from the outside. If an ordinary Doll's base layer is in such a state of disarray, they'd probably have thrown up errors and shut down long ago. +...Or could it be that this isn't inside her. It's an external neural cloud domain being processed internally... Is that possible?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Shake>||<BIN>201</BIN><白屏2><SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Suddenly, M4A1 runs past UMP45.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<白屏1>:M4?! Uh...wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>206</BIN><白屏2>:45 runs after the image, but the space suddenly changes, and a mansion appears in front of her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is this an illusion? Or is this a memory fragment?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A stream of M4A1's phantoms run past 45 and into the bizarre mansion. +Different M4s hurriedly enter with different gaits and different looks on their faces. 45 isn't sure if she's imagining things, but she senses that the trees overhead are growing denser.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>45?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Oh no... The signal on my side is too much of a mess, and there's a lot of noise...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What did you find?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:45 stands where the M4s were passing through earlier and studies the mansion before her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nothing much... Just that there's a mansion in front of me... I feel the answer should be in there.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>A mansion? I think there's something wrong about a mansion appearing in a neural cloud. 45—</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The transmission gets cut off.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Somewhat dazzled by the light, UMP45 narrows her eyes and stares at the silhouette of the mansion, then walks up to its front door. +Just as she's about to raise her foot and step forward, she suddenly feels someone shove her hard from the front.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The white light before 45's eyes instantly vanishes, and she experiences the feeling of an endless descent. +After falling in the darkness for a long time, 45 feels herself slamming onto the ground.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dammit, why is her Level II so weird?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as 45 starts muttering to herself, she subconsciously cuts herself off. +That's because 45 suddenly realizes exactly where she is.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It didn't take long for me to be spotted. I'm no longer in M4's neural cloud, huh. +Well then, let me see what you're all about, "monster" living inside a Doll's neural cloud.
