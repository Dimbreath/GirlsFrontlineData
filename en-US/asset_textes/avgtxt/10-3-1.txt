RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:(So this is...M4A1...) +(I gotta say something...) +Um...
RO635(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4A1 looks up and gazes at RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I just want to say... +(C'mon, RO! Say something!) +You're the leader of the AR Team now, aren't you...?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That is correct. +You just transferred your command authorizations to me, didn't you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Err...you're right... +Oh, and...regarding the search for M16A1...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You didn't find her, did you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's true, but there's still a possibility that she survived, so please—
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Our current mission takes higher priority. No further attempts to find M16A1 are to be made for now.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hmm...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Thank you for your concern, but I'm fine.
RO635(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4A1 touches M16A1's equipment case gently.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We'll talk after this operation is over. +(This isn't the time to be dejected...) +(It's because of my indecisiveness that the AR Team is in this sorry state...) +(AR-15...) +(And M16...) +(I must pull myself together. I can't afford to be the weakling that I've always been...) +(Which is why...I must focus on leading everyone in accomplishing our mission...like a proper commander!)

SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4...are you okay?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:How can I not worry? You've been away for so long...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:As you can see, I'm perfectly alright. +You should be happy about that. +More importantly, what did the Commander tell you?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The Commander said the Military just gave the order to deploy our forces...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Right now? What's the hurry?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We won't have time to catch a break at the base. We must head toward the S.F. stronghold and regroup with the Commander right away. +The Commander should've set off by now.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Good. Looks like we haven't missed the first kill.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Are you sure you're okay, M4?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I told you, I'm fine. We're gonna cause a bloodbath on the field soon. Isn't that what you want?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Of course I can't wait to tear apart some Sangvis junk, but I'm more worried about you. You've barely recovered...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's taken me way too long to recover. It's time I stretched myself a bit. +Everyone, check your gear. We're heading out!
