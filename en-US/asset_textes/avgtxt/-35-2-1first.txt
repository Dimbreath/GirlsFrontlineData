()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:... Behind a shady corner near the Griffin base.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:So what's this plan of yours?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Remember the tech Mastermind recently developed?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You mean the one-way jam in comm links or the augmentation mammapla—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer clamps a hand fearfully over Gager's mouth and gingerly touches the bridge of her own nose.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Neither! I'm talking about simulating Griffin signals!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:The one that allows us to temporarily disguise our Sangvis signals as Griffin's? +That's completely experimental technology, and only proves effective for about 30 minutes.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Yeah, but that's more than enough.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At Gager's thoughtful nod, Destroyer grabs a Dinergate and starts tinkering with it enthusiastically.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:As long as we physically alter this Dinergate to look like the Griffin model and cover up its Sangvis signal with a simulated Griffin signal, those stupid T-Dolls won't have a clue! +Then, I'll snatch away the gifts while the Dinergate creates a diversion—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer grows more animated as she speaks. The Dinergate is modified in no time, save for a few parts that cannot fit anywhere. Gager then takes it into her hands...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:... +Are you sure this isn't going to cause any unexpected problems? +After all, this technology hasn't undergone any form of testing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer watches nervously as Gager activates the Dinergate. Upon seeing nothing out of the ordinary, Destroyer continues...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Ahem. Well, since nothing seems to be the problem, we can proceed as planned. +Think about it, this is also the perfect time for you to look for that traitor. +We'll both get what we want.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:It does appear to be a pretty foolproof plan. +Then let's do it. However, in order to properly control the Dinergates, we'll have to split up.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I'll get in touch if anything happens.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I hope you're smarter than that idiot. +Let's kickstart this plan with an ambush laid by my forces.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:... Hmm? What idiot?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Gager's figure had already vanished into the snowy night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>81</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... At the Griffin base.
M1918(6)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Kalina, Sangvis units have been detected about 500 meters outside of the main entrance! Recon squad is requesting aid!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:At a time like this...?
CZ75(2)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Right on time! I was just worrying about not finding any good materials!
Ameli(2)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:The Commander isn't here... It's scary... I want to hide...
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker><Shake>||:Hey, don't go burrowing off... I don't want to experience a "game over" alone on a Christmas Day without the Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG5 sighs as she pulls Ameli out from her hidey-hole. 
MG5(2)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Do these T-Doll's neural clouds just turn into goop the moment something unexpected happens?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Ahaha, "turn into goop". You're funny, Gr MG5...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Noticing the deafening silence and M14's awkward stare, M21 coughs to cover up her embarrassment.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Let's get back on track. My neural cloud can't handle any more of your nonsense.
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:While the Commander might not be here, we still have Kalina, so let's hurry up and prepare for battle.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Don't worry. I've studied up on the Commander's combat records. Leave the commanding to me!
