AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:.... + There's another detachment 1700m ahead and to the right, heading right for us. +Oh dear...S.F. has blocked our path in three directions now. Could this be a coincidence?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:There's only one explanation for how Sangvis Ferri has been tracking our position—
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>117</BIN>:It's my fault again, right?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This is precisely why we have to take you away.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:We've entered firing range of that Sangvis squad in the rear, and they're opening fire. +Those trash are too lazy to even do proper recon.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They're simply acting according to preset orders. I'm guessing Mastermind has her hands full at the moment.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So that's all there is to Mastermind's computational capacity, huh. I was hoping Sangvis Ferri would put more effort in countering the Military. +That said, this isn't good news for us either.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:...I'm beginning to wonder why I took this mission. +It's like trying to avoid moths while carrying a lamp. Really asking for it, you know. Is there any cover nearby?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Like I said... +Why did you come back...?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Now's not the time to look for cover, AR-15. The Sangvis units from 11 o'clock are almost here.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2><BIN>118</BIN>:If you really think I'm a burden, then all you have to do is dump me here! +Put me down, AR-15! Let me look for SOP-II and RO!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Would you mind not freaking out all the time? +Wait a while longer. When I can't hold on any more, you'll get your way. +But right now, I don't want to waste my efforts.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:We need to get clear. There's some open space up ahead; the Military had a big battle there just now. +Prepare to race through the wrecks, but if you're even the least bit careless, you'll be joining them.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:Put me down, AR-15! +I don't...I don't want you to die for me again, so put me down!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Put a sock in it. Of course I'll drop you if I can't run fast enough to save myself! +AK-12, how much longer before that third Sangvis detachment catches up?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Around 10 minutes? +I figure their plan is to surround us here. Simple and crude...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:...But it's effective. +Let's say everything's as you predicted. You've got a way of dealing with them, right?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:And what if I said...no?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then you'll die a very humiliating death here. +And I know that while you don't really mind the part about being dead, you can't stand being humiliated. +So let's have it, before they punch through the cover behind us.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:Ah... +Ange told me you were old-fashioned and stubborn, so I was prepared to go on an op with a Dummy. +But you make the most interesting faces. I'm curious about you all over again, AR-15.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That doesn't sound good...So, what do you plan to do?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The Sangvis units chasing us are already gathered here. So we'll wipe them all out in one shot.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:With just the two of us?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'd be enough by myself, but I wouldn't mind you firing from the side to add to the fun. +AN-94 is more suited for such brutish ways of fighting, so I'd rather borrow some of the military units.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're going to...force a connection? +But...the strain on your neural cloud...
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't judge me by your standards, Miss M4A1. +Hmm... While these military units would be punched through soon if we kept using them as cover, they'd be enough to deal with those Sangvis forces once I can get them moving.
()||<黑屏1>:...Click, click— +...Beep, beep, beep. + ...Whirrr—!
军方人形()<Speaker>Military unit</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Authentication complete. Awaiting orders.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:How did you do that...? That was incredibly quick.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:Dear me, I'm not some random civilian Doll haphazardly modified with an Imprint. +Being praised for something so obvious kinda bothers me.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then couldn't you have done this earlier?! Or did you want to watch me run myself into the ground?!
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Forcing a connection is really tiring, you know? Besides, we hadn't gotten into the middle of these hunks of junk back then. +Still, now that it's done, I'll sweep away these Sangvis forces to buy us some time and use the rest to make up for screwing up on M4.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2><黑屏2><BIN>118</BIN>:Eh?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Make up?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh yes, making up. Just like I did with you.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You mean...you've got Level II debugging equipment with you?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:Well, I AM an electronic warfare specialist. Obviously I'd have that stuff inside me. +If there's enough time, then we should get started once we fall back to a safe zone.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...what are you talking about?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't you want to run on your own two legs? It's time to repair you. +And add a few things while we're at it...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Add? Add what?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You'll become...like me.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Stronger, less restrained, but also wilder... +This is where all the misfortunes of being a Doll begin.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +What on earth...do you mean?
