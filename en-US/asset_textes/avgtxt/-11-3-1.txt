UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, do you copy?! We must abort the mission! +Even Sier advices us to retreat to the perimeter for the time being and think of something else!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No, listen to me. We stick to the plan.
UMP45(2);HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:What are you thinking, 45? S.F. knows our every move. +No matter how we proceed, it's suicide if we go any further.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(3)||:No... S.F. doesn't know our every move. +All they know is MY move.
UMP45(2);HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What? What makes you think so?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:Think about it... +Destroyer only made the two broadcasts after I said something. +And judging from what she said, she couldn't hear you guys.
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:But she can hear your voice, right? She can find out what you're doing any time!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:I think she can indeed hear my voice, but not "any time". +Otherwise, she would've just blown us right up rather than only making two broadcasts this whole time. +Besides, her new body must still be incomplete, or we would've found her by now.
UMP45(2);HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So you plan on getting back the drone while the window is still open?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:This is our best shot. +If we retreat now, there won't be another attempt. +The drone will be theirs - mission failed.
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:But how do we know you're making the right call? If this is a Sangvis trap...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:Have I ever been wrong?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:...Understood. +But 416 and Gr G11 are still out there. We have to meet up with them.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:That won't be necessary. 9, go get the drone. I'll cover you with my echelons. +416, head to scouting point eins. Gr G11, scouting point zwei. The two of you monitor every single junction within sight. Report immediately if you detect any signal of a Sangvis Ringleader!
UMP45(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I sure hope your lucky guess is right. Get up, Gr G11. We're going!
UMP45(2);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ugh... I have to do this...on my own?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Don't worry. I'll give you cover.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:What about you, 45? +If you're right, then aren't you their primary target?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(2)||:True. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't help dwelling on it. +Keep calm. We only have a tighter deadline. It'll be fine as long as you're snappy. +I'll only be safe if you get the drone ASAP.
UMP45(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:45 claps her hands twice.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Chop chop, girls. +Get your hands on the drone and let's all go home!
