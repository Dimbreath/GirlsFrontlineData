Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>265</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_25</BGM>:Ah... I don't know why but somehow it feels like it's been ages since I last had an outing! +Everything looks new to me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's probably because you've been busy with missions.
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Missions from the Agency are the most important, aren't they? +But after work, it's only right to march~ ahead~ happily like this!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're really cheerful. +My, you've bought a lot of books. I thought there was only one new picture book?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:We don't get to go out often, so Claes and the others have asked me to get them some books too. +I don't have to pay out of my own pocket anyway, so I agreed to help, hehehe~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sheesh. +Still, do you really need to read while you walk? Why don't you read it after we get home?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:But I'm DYING to find out what happens next! 
()||:Cano explains as she twirls merrily in the street, waving her picture book around and being completely oblivious to everything else. +Meanwhile, around the corner of the street, a girl is being dragged along by the leash of a gigantic dog.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hahaha, slow down, Perro!
()||:The girl is wearing a pretty dress and leather shoes, her heels pitter-pattering crisply against the ground. +The sun shines mildly on her hair and clothes, casting a warm halo around her entire figure.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Whoa!
()||<震屏3>:Woof woof woof! +Cano and the girl collide into each other as the dog barks.
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Ow, ow, ow... S-Sorry about that! Are you okay?
()||:Cano jumps back on her feet and hurries over to help the other girl up.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm alright, don't worry.
()||:The girl with long, brown hair smiles kindly even though she just got knocked over. She looks exactly like a well-mannered little lady from a rich family. +She dusts herself off lightly and answers Cano with a smile while trying to soothe her spooked dog.
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:Oh...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it, Henrietta?
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:That's Angelica. Why would she be here?
()||:I've kind of figured out who this girl is based on intuition, though her sudden appearance still takes me by surprise. +The main character is bound to make an appearance...I suppose...? +What exactly is the point of taking Angelica out of her own role in the play?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry!
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:It's okay, really! Even Perro thinks it's no big deal, don't you, Perro?
()<Speaker>Big Dog</Speaker>||:Woof!
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:In that case, we'll be leaving~
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Oh, one second. May I ask what book it is that you're holding...?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Huh? This? +It's the very popular "Prince of the Kingdom of Pasta"! Have you never read it?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:No...I haven't, but...
()||:Angelica takes the picture book from Cano.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:But...somehow it feels very familiar...
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:That's the picture book Signore Marco wrote for her, how come she doesn't remember it at all? +We all know it's not her fault, nor is it Signore Marco's fault...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So whose fault is it?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:At that moment, an ear-splitting screech of a car's tires draws dangerously close. I haven't encountered any enemy here so far, but I can tell our interceptors are far from friendly. +Cano also looks nervous. Clattering footsteps come from all around us – we're about to be surrounded.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Cano, get Angelica out of—
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Before I can even finish, a burst of bullets are fired in my direction!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:!
()||:A force jerks me back abruptly from behind and I land heavily on the ground. +A bullet whizzes past the top of my head and hits the wall behind me, producing a deafening crack. +Meanwhile, Cano has already drawn her weapon and started returning fire.
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Are you okay?! It's a terrorist attack by the Five Republics!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine! Get them all!
()||:I turn around and see Angelica staring at me with a terrified look on her face. It was undoubtedly her that just saved me by dragging me off my feet. +No ordinary human with normal reflexes could've done that, but right now she looks exactly like an ordinary girl who's very frightened.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks for that.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:I... What...
()||:Sitting on the ground, Angelica stares dubiously at her hands, then at me.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Signore...Marco?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You know my name?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:I shouldn't know you...but why do I feel like...
()||:Angelica's eyes gradually grow more resolved. I can sense the airs of a "rich girl" dissipating from her.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:We can't let them get any closer. Please give me a gun, Signore Marco.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But you...
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:I can fight! A gun, Signore Marco!
()||:I gape for a second, then I hand my sidearm to Angelica. +Once she takes it, she immediately heads over to Cano and covers the flank almost instinctively.
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right, protecting our Handler is our most sacred duty, one that we can never forget. I was a little unsure when I first saw her, but now it's beyond all question – we have found the real Angelica.
