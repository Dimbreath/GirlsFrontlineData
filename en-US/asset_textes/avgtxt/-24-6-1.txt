SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Found it! This is a Sangvis reserve outpost, and... +The unit signals here are really weak. Looks like hardly anyone's guarding it... +For safety's sake, I'll expand my detection radius.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II looks closely at the electronic map.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The enemies...are all above the base. What are they doing? +Eh, who cares, all I need is to steal a power supply anyway. This is a great opportunity! +Looks like we'll be able to see each other again soon, RO! Now, all we need to do is pinpoint the loc—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Whum. +Just then, SOP-II notices several Griffin signals on the map.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Are those... +Griffin T-Dolls? +Don't tell me... +They're the forces from the resupply point who got surrounded by Sangvis Ferri and were forced to flee? +And then S.F. left their own base to chase them...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:...SOP-II hesitates.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑点2>:Keep calm and think, SOP-II... +What would RO do? +She'd say, "Our friends are surrounded by S.F., and they're about to be wiped out."  +"We must save them no matter how dangerous it is. We're allies on the battlefield." +Yeah, she'd definitely say that. +But...these Dolls can back their neural clouds up, right? And I only have one shot at this... +RO isn't awake yet, and I don't have a command module either... +I'm all alone, while S.F. must surely have a Ringleader with them... +Nobody's going to take responsibility for my actions. Would it be safer to find a backup power source first...?
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:Ahhhhhhhhhh what a pain—! +Why do I have to make choices like these?! I'm not a team leader, and I haven't been given any orders either! +I... What should I do...?
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II stands in place, but the world does not answer.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah, whatever, I'll just head out first... +That's right, I'll head out first and think about it later!
