UMP40 and UMP45, if I remember correctly? +Heheh, that's right! +You remember...our designation... +Haha, I remember every single member on the team. Not to mention you're pretty famous. +M16A1, what are you doing? +Huh? Just chatting. +What's the point in chatting with T-Dolls like them? +Don't say that. Every T-Doll on the frontline has something to contribute to the effort. Who knows? They might just end up saving your life at some point. +Saving my life? We can simply backup our neural clouds. True pros won't hesitate making sacrifices. +Haha, what an extremist. Still, best not take any bullets if you can help it, eh? +Sorry about that.
