AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>207</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:M4, they've sealed us off! +What now?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Tsk, is there another route we can take...? +Not this way... This won't do either... What about this...? Dammit!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The enemies are closing in!
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Backed yourself into a corner, have you?</color>
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The white units had M4A1 and ST AR-15 surrounded at a dead end in the building. A Nyto strolled out casually from among the units. She planted herself in front of the only exit and pointed her weapon at them.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Didn't you say you couldn't control these Nytos?</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I wasn't able to back then, but it was only a matter of time.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If you can occupy someone else's body, then why won't you just leave me alone?!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I was cultivated in your neural cloud in the first place, and I have no interest in controlling someone else's body.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've been telling you all along that I am after the same thing as you – to find out who I really am.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It doesn't sound convincing at all coming from a puppet under your control.</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What other choice do I have?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>So what are you going to do? Shoot us full of holes?</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lunasia, do you know what your most valuable bargaining chip is?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Humph...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You know that I don't want to hurt you, but there is something I need to tell you.</color>
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll in black lowered her weapon and pointed towards the distance.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Not too far from here, another company of the white forces are about to engage Ange and Griffin in battle.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What?!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you want to stay here and dawdle, you'll have to kiss the last departing flight goodbye.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You still don't understand?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I only managed to hijack these units because the puppet who's in charge of them is busy elsewhere.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>When it realizes what I'm doing, my hands will be completely tied.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Not only will you miss the last available flight, your chances of leaving this area alive will be practically nil.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I...don't believe you...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, you do. You're just refusing to acknowledge that.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You're like a sulking child, being unnecessarily difficult and wasting precious time.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I am not—</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You've already figured out the truth yourself.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The fact is that you can't do this on your own.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>All I'm trying to do is to make you realize that and admit it yourself.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So are you ready to take me back?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Of course, I can force my way through whether you're willing or not, but I'd much rather you ask me to come back in your own words.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't even think about it!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>In return, I can freeze all these white units and this black puppet on the spot so that you can get to the signal tower right away.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You can only venture on if you survive. Don't just think about yourself. Consider what's best for the friend standing right next to you.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Do I even have a choice?</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Of course you do. You've always had a choice.</color>
()||<黑点2><BIN>156</BIN><SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:30 minutes later.
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The white units all stopped moving for some reason...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's the best possible outcome.
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:This has something to do with you, right? Both the mysterious consciousness and the black puppet are...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Sorry... I'd rather not talk about that now...
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Any news from Ange?
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:DEFY got back to us. +AK-12 sent us a set of coordinates. Their chopper will be waiting for us there. +But Ange is unconscious, and the Commander got captured by the white enemies... They went through a really tough fight.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...So the mission is still a failure in the end?
()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It's fortunate enough that we're all getting out of here at all... Just leave the rest till later.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Lunasia, this is just the beginning. We need an explanation. An answer. A resolution. The truth.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I know what I must do. You told me I've always had a choice, so I've made the choice to never believe you ever again.</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That doesn't matter. I'll still help you because we are one. That's a fact that you can't deny or change.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>One day, you will understand that everything is written in the stars, just as one day, you will finally accept the fact that you are Lunasia.</color>
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If that is true, then I will face it, and when the time comes...I'll even fulfill this destiny myself.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But your so-called "written in the stars" is just another pointless lie to me.</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>That's alright. Time will tell. When you stop being so close-minded, the answer will naturally present itself. Perhaps it simply isn't time yet.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But it doesn't matter. I don't mind waiting for the day when you finally accept the truth. I know such a day will come.</color>
