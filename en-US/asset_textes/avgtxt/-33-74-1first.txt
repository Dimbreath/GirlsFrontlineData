()||:<color=#00CCFF>The audio recording starts playing.</color>
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>The loud murmuring of a discussion.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>A phone starts ringing suddenly and silences the entire room.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>The ringing persists for a long time before someone finally picks it up after a cough.</color>
()||:【Who's this?】
()||:【What, do you dread picking up a call from me so much?】+【If you're so reluctant to talk to me on the phone, I can write to you next time. After all, the postbox on Lubyanka Square is much more accessible than a line to Internal Affairs.】
()||:【You can save your gibberish till I have you locked up in the interrogation room.】
()||:【You sound rather piqued. I don't understand. Shouldn't you be happy about being the big winner of the last game?】
()||:【I'm certain my mood will dramatically improve if I can find out where you are calling me from and who it was that put you through.】
()||:【You used me to reopen the base that was supposed to remain sealed indefinitely under the Relics Treaty so that Statesec will seemingly have nothing to do with the Pike Nodes. Now that I've done my part and you no longer have use for me, you want to kill me? That isn't very gracious of you, Chief.】
()||:【I don't know what you're talking about.】
()||:【That's okay, it's enough that I know. You may be an ungrateful scumbag, but I won't hold it against you.】+【That Carter got you good in the Butterfly Incident, I bet you still hold a grudge against him. I've prepared a gift for you - one that can send Carter to hell.】
()||:【What kind of gift?】
()||:【Evidence of Carter and his men conducting illegal research on the Relics. I'm sure such evidence is enough for you to get them a secret execution. What do you say?】
()||:【Humph, and how do I receive this gift?】
()||:【Simple. Have someone get it for you.】
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>All of a sudden, there comes the sound of a door being blasted open, followed by a lot of clattering footsteps and the sound of metal colliding.</color>
()||:【Don't move! Get down on the floor! Clear out the room! Chop, chop!】
()||:<color=#A9A9A9>More continuous footsteps and the sound of a door being kicked open.</color>
()||:【Sir, the area has been cleared. The room is completely empty. All we found was a box.】
()||:【Oho, your men are faster than I expected. I suppose they ARE professionals.】
()||:【Tsk...】
()||:【You didn't think I would be stupid enough to just sit there and let you catch me, did you? Still, I do applaud Statesec for solving my encryption algorithms so quickly.】
()||:【I am going to get you one day.】
()||<黑屏1>:【Before that, take a good look at the box I left behind. Those coordinates are extraordinarily valuable. I look forward to seeing who you'd send over there, hehehe.】
