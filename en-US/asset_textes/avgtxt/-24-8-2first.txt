Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2>:SOP-II! Our defense line is up! 
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Alright! Cheer up now, everyone. Scarecrow won't be able to last much longer— Cough...cough...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:What's wrong?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cough... I shouted too much, so my voice module's a little overloaded...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Is it that bad?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ah...when I fled earlier, I threw away a lot of unnecessary parts...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:No wonder your body is all beat-up... +Don't worry, we held on to some supplies while we were withdrawing. We can help fix you up a little. +So go rest a bit. Scarecrow won't attack right away.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We're not just going to hold the line here, we'd best evacuate if we find a chan—

SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Huh? That noise...it's coming from our flank! +Does S.F. still have the manpower to split their forces?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(3)||:SOP-II, it's the Military! They've found us!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The Military?! Why are they still here?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(3)||:They never left! The fighting from earlier must have attracted their patrols! Dammit! +We're going to be attacked from both sides now. Not only can we not fall back, we won't be able to hold out much longer!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No, we won't be caught in a pincer attack... +Sangvis...their first move won't be to attack us.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(3)||:Why is that?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:S.F. is a higher priority for the Military than us. I'm guessing they're not much better off than we are.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(3)||:Could it be...the Military's attacking them too? +Then what should we do now?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:... +Cx4... +Do you trust me?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Of, of course I do! +If not for you, we'd all have died long ago!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then...you have to trust me for what comes next. Can you do that?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<黑屏1>:Huh? +What...are you going to do?
