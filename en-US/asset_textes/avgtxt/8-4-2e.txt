M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Per...sica.+I've extracted...the file.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>：...+Well done, M16.+Deliver it to 16Lab with your drone.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||：I've already dispatched it along with the equipment you gave me...+I've never used it, and I hope M4A1 will never have to use it either...
M16(3);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：...She'll use it as she sees fit.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||：Ha, true... She's a smart girl...+A bit TOO smart, unfortunately. An indecisive AI isn't fit for command. You really should've designed her to be more assertive.+Or if I'd been more strict with her... Sadly, that's no longer possible...
M16(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Perhaps... But you're certainly still helping her.+You know...M4 is right behind me. Everything you say is directly transmitted to her neural cloud.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Why are you doing that?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：To stabilize her mental state.+I'm attempting to break her seals, but forcing her to awaken through technology will make her neural cloud go haywire.+Your voice is keeping her calm and at peace. That's crucial to repairing and recalibrating the personality of her AI.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Seal? Recalibrate? I don't think I'm following...
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：M4A1... This time, I won't just wake her up.+When she awakes, she'll be stronger...and more dependable...+That's...how she used to be.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||：Ha, I just can't picture...an M4A1 like that.+Too bad...I won't get to see it...
M16(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Will you regret this, M16A1?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||<黑屏1>：Why would I? It's a bargain for me!+If I really mean that much to her...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>54</BIN>：Tsk...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：What is it? Your neural cloud...is starting to act up.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：My head...is throbbing...+It's a very dull ache, nothing too bad, but it's kinda annoying... Is this how it feels to be rewired by Parapluie?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Possibly... But AR-15 never reported this.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Maybe she didn't want to. That girl...is always acting brave.+And...now there seems to be interference in my channel...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：That's Sangvis Ferri rewriting some of your modules. The channel will be jammed.+Very soon, you won't be able to hear me...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Ha...+So I won't even get to say goodbye?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：The link is still there. If you want to say goodbye, do it now.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Haha, will I wake her up, like in your fairytales?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Do you want that?
 ()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：M16 falls silent for a moment.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：M4A1...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>：No matter what I'll turn into...wait for me.
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：M16...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Ha, that's a bit embarrassing...+But it's all I want to say...
 ()||：With that, M16 gives herself a good stretch.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：In any case, I'm done here, right? What a relief.+Then let's bid each other farewell while my mind is still my own...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：M16...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：...!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：M16...+Don't go...
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：...!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：M16...don't go...!+M16A1!!
()||<黑屏1>：At last, I see hope in this labyrinth.+It is in the form of a familiar and dependable figure, burning all alone in the distance, and I know that is the exit...+I run after her. The flame grows rapidly and bursts into a blinding light...+Until at last, it turns into a surgical lamp in the ceiling...and I make my way back into reality from what seemed like an endless dream.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>53</BIN>：(Gasps) (Pants)
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：M4A1...+You've finally...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：...+Where...am I...?
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：You're home, M4. Welcome back...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：I see... I have finally...+Also, Miss...Persica...+...Where is M16?+I heard her voice...
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：M16...+Is out on a mission... She isn't here for the time being.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Is...that so...+I want to...see her...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Really? Then you'll have to wait for quite a while...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>：Statics crowd out all correspondence in the channel, and the signal is completely lost. It's time to leave. Leave everyone behind...+I get on my feet and dust myself. I'm starting to feel rather attached to the room.+Not because of the deleted memory, but because this is where I bade my last farewell...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>54</BIN><黑屏1>：I am bugged. I am monitored. I am used as an anti-communication weapon... What will I turn into, now that I've been marked by Parapluie?+The person who comes to mind right now isn't myself or anyone else. It is none other than AR-15...+That girl... What would she be thinking at a time like this...?+I'm losing my train of thought. I take a deep breath and hug my weapon tight.+I leave the room behind as the old iron door creaks shut.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>："Most people won't realize it's the last day of their life as they wake up that morning."+Sometimes, things are actually easier when there's nothing else to lose.
()||：Thud!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>57</BIN>：My neural cloud can no longer propel my limbs. I fall on my knees in the long corridor, like a cat with its bones taken out.+Time's up...+Now...I just have to await my fate...+......
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Singing...?
()||：I start to hear the singing of a clear, female voice. I can no longer tell where it's coming from.+Maybe it won't hurt to just listen... I'm truly exhausted...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Beautiful...+Have I finally...started dreaming as well...?
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>：Not really, M16A1. This is neither a dream nor a delusion.+You're merely completely immersed in the Sangvis deep web.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>56</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>：Dream...er...
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：My, my. You know...I really, really hate handling stuff like this...+Things that make me work overtime on short notice really ruin my mood...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Well...? Not gonna...shoot...?
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Now let's not be hasty. Let me tell you something interesting.+Just now, you see, a modular drone flew over the area...+That kind of thing can be spotted from above very easily, you know...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：You mean... WHAT?!
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Relax. It has certainly been shot down, but it has fallen somewhere beyond my territory.+It'll take a while to see who'll get to it first.+But then again, it no longer has anything to do with you, does it?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Humph...+Don't underestimate...our Commander...
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Whatever. After all, I don't really care about that sort of thing.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：So...what...do you want?
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||：Technically, it's our Mastermind that wants to see you.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：What?+I'm not seeing her here.
Dreamer()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：She isn't here, alright...+But she's there in your mind...+Didn't you just hear her?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：...!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN>：The next day. Griffin HQ.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||：Welcome back, Mr Kryuger.+Was everything sorted last night?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Thanks to Persica, it's dealt with for the time being.+But we can't let down our guard. The military will pressure us time and time again in the future.
NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：By the way, Mr Kryuger...+Regarding the T-Doll M16A1...
NPC-Helian(1);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Her sacrifice will not be in vain.+Reward the Commander in charge of the operation. Comfort the other T-Dolls and keep a close eye on their mental state.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Understood. I'll follow up on the matter. However...if I may be frank, sir, aren't the AR Team's neural clouds a little inconvenient?
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Everything comes with a price, Helian.+We're on the battlefield. There are always things that matter more than others.+Let's head to the office. I need to make some changes to the working plan. Are the preparations we've discussed ready?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Yes...+Mr Kryuger, is the final showdown...about to begin?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Just get on with the preparations...
Kryuger()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：In any case, it won't be very far off.
