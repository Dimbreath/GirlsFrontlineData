TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Phew...that was close. +It's finally over.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Congratulations on your outstanding performance, Leader K2.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:That wasn't too bad. This world is on a relatively shallow Level, so the stress on the command module is minimal. +If it had been in real life or standard electronic warfare, my neural cloud would probably be pretty scrambled by now.
K2(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:... +Now tell us, K2. +Why exactly are you here...?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:Well...
K2(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Ah...of course you'd be here. +After all, we were saved by the echelon under your command... +Which makes you...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:The 【K】 in 【ATK】. +Actually, that's just a silly name the Fairies came up for us. +Sorry, M950A and Thunder, for keeping you in the dark this whole time. It's a little awkward now, haha...
K2(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:It's not funny!  +How...how could you do this?! +Arghhhhhh! You make us look like idiots!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:I'm so sorry, 950. We didn't mean to keep secrets...
K2(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Then what is the meaning of this?! +My dear team leader runs off on adventures to an alternate universe with her teammates while I try to play role model like a moron, is that it?!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:We'll explain later. I take responsibility for everything, 950. +But right now, the most important thing is to find AEK.
K2(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:AEK...where the hell has she gone?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:TMP has been trying to find her, but...
K2(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:I found her rough location.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;TMP(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:Huh? Really?
K2(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Yeah!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I found it... +The rumors are real!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:What's real?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:The 【Graveyard】... +The hidden 【Graveyard】 in 【Pocket City】... I found it!
TMP(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What?! +You say you found the 【Graveyard】?!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;M950A(0)||:But-but it's all ruined, thanks to you! +I was tailing the two Fairies...but you spotted me at the bar!
TMP(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:The two Fairies? Which two Fairies?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;M950A(0)||:Oh yeah, they were retreating with you! +I've been digging around for a long time and apparently they're the only ones who know that the 【Graveyard】 actually exists! +It's all your fault it's all your fault it's all your fault!
TMP(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;M950A(0)||:...TMP flaps her long sleeves at M950A.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Argh! Stop it! +What's that got to do with me?! You were trying to run!
