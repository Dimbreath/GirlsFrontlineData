NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Everything's been going smoothly, Commander. +Where exactly is this legendary enemy that no one has ever seen? Somewhere further in? +...Hmm? Enemies? I thought we've taken care of them all? +Keeping a low profile and killing everything we come across are essentially the same thing, right? Now then...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker><通讯框>;NEGEV(0)||:Tavor hailing Negev! Negev, are you there?
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Negev is never absent. What is it?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Sorry, the situation has changed. +My movement has alerted Sangvis forces to our presence. They're currently congregating near the car factory. +If we can get there in half an hour, we'll still have a chance to retrieve our target without engaging them directly.
TAR21(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:You got that, Galil? +Check our progress for me... +Hey, Galil...?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Pzzzt. Pzzzt.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker><通讯框>;NEGEV(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...Negev! Do you copy?! +I've been spotted and surrounded! I need support and route of retreat!
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:At the same time?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Same time? What do you mean? Hurry up and come get me!
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Tell me the fastest route from my current location to the car factory and the time it'll take to get there. Then we'll deal with the rescue.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Arghhhh here it is again! The Negev-esque negotiation! Where the hell did you pick that up?!
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Negev is a prodigy. I was born knowing how to spell "victory", remember? +Hurry. We don't have much time.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Alright, alright! I've sent you the route. You can make it in 25 minutes, but only if you can get past the next outpost fast enough!
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:And what's the fastest way of doing that?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Don't be spotted too often, or kill everyone who sees you.
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Perfect.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:As for my rescue, will Tavor-
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Tavor is still busy and can't join you yet. Hold on and don't die.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:What? Hey, then how...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Click. Negev hangs up.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay. Let me finish the job.
