()||:【For heaven's sake. That cost me way too much.】
()||:【What is this?】
()||:【A report about the incident four years ago. Most of it has been erased. I don't know who tampered with it, but it was definitely a pro.】
()||:【I found some similar incidents. "Young Girl Responsible for Assaults in Griffin Sectors", 16 cases. Witnesses had reported seeing girls that resembled the assailant in multiple areas.】
()||:【"The assailant who survived could not be identified. After interrogation, she was sent to..." This part got struck out. "In the other cases, the remains of the shot assailants were processed..." This also got crossed out.】
()||:【I'm guessing the other girls were all identical.】
()||:【They were clones?】
()||:【If he was behind everything, he would certainly have no qualms about that. Ethics and morals mean absolutely nothing to him.】
()||:【Only 16 cases were documented in the report; there might actually be more clones than what we know of.】
()||:【Is it possible to track down the other clones?】
()||:【As long as one of them comes into contact with you. The others must've been destroyed upon retrieval. Besides, this was four years ago, and Griffin has jurisdiction in many sectors.】
()||:【...Indeed. Even back then, I thought I ran into her by pure coincidence.】
()||:【But you're correct in suspecting otherwise. That incident was anything but a coincidence. Those clones were actually transporting something.】
()||:【...Could they be transporting their brain?】
()||:【That's my guess as well. But is that even possible? Why would he know you were scanning their brains?】
()||:【He knows me too well... Also, her brain waves are very peculiar, almost structured like a Doll's neural cloud...】
()||:【But...isn't it quite a technical challenge to digitize the human consciousness?】
()||:【That's true...which was precisely why he was sure I would do it.】
()||<黑屏1>:【In the end, I still lost to myself... I've got to do something.】
