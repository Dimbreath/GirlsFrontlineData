赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...And that is everything we know about what's happening in Area S09. +The Military's actual main force has found an excuse to enter the region. +They are also declaring that this is a terrorist incident caused by a PMC going rogue, and the regular army is going to take over the administration of this entire region very soon.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:...I knew it. +The first thing I considered was that the Military would use us as shields, then discard us to achieve their aims.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:But in the end, they flat-out threw Griffin under the bus. Now they're trying to push us into a corner.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Carter's plan was more outrageous than I'd imagined.
()||:...A nearby TV is reporting a major incident that occurred during a joint training exercise between the Military and a PMC. +General Carter is giving a statement on behalf of the Military.
卡特()<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||:Regarding the accident which occurred during this training exercise, there is no need for anyone to worry. +Our forces have activated our emergency response plan and the situation is currently under control. +Please be at ease. The Military has a firm grasp of the situation, and we will conduct a legal investigation to determine the parties responsible for this incident...
()||:...Kryuger turns off the TV.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Helian, issue the evacuation orders as planned, then take everyone and go.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, are you sure...you want to stay here?
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:They only need one scapegoat to help them finish acting out this farce. +Given the chaos on the battlefield, they cannot and need not shut down all of Griffin's frontline bases. +Griffin will not vanish as long as those commanders and T-Dolls are still around. +And those commanders will need someone to help them. Helian, I trust you know what I'm talking about.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I...
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I'm sure you will be safe.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:Do I look like a man who'll let himself be taken without a fight?
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then take care, Mr. Kryuger. +I will lead everyone while we await your return.
()||<BIN>120</BIN><黑屏2>:...Helian bows and leaves the office.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||:... +Now then...
()||:...Kryuger makes a personal call.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Havier, it's me. +I'd like to tell you something while we're still alive...
()||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the same time, while withdrawing to Area S11. +...The Commander has just achieved victory.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM><BIN>99</BIN><Night>:We did it! Commander, your tactics were effective, and we finally beat those military units! +Now this route is safe, and everybody will be able to...
()||<BIN>99</BIN><Night>:...Click.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<Night><BIN>99</BIN>:Yes...alright... +Commander, there's information here which indicates that other Griffin T-Dolls besides ourselves are withdrawing too... +In relation to our current location, they're still behind us! +...Eh? You want us to escort them out of the contaminated zone?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:Understood! Everyone will be a bit upset about getting home late, but we've got to do this! +Heheh, besides, not doing so just isn't our style. Let's hold this place and protect everyone!
