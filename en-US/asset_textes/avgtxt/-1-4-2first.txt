Weaver(2)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Damn it, an attack by Griffin!+They must be under the command of Squad 404... So, they're alive after all!
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Guess again, Ouroboros.
OTs14(0)<Speaker>Ots-14</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:That undignified look of distress on your face... It doesn't suit you.
Weaver(2)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:OTs-14, you're still alive?
Weaver(2);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs14</Speaker>||:This is how life is, Ouroboros, not everything will go your way.
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:......+You're right. Savoring your deaths without having to do any work myself isn't very likely to happen...
Weaver(1);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs14</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Your mission has already failed in that explosion. Do you still intend to fight to the death?
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:For my self-worth and dignity... Slaves like you will not understand...
Weaver(2)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑屏1>:I can destroy you and every T-Doll under Griffin's command!+Including AR Team, Squad 404, and elites like you.+I will prove to the Mastermind that I am infinitely more valuable than any jammer could ever be!
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>2</BIN><Night>:So it was OTs-14 that was with SPP-1! Helian really helped us out this time!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:So, there's our victory condition. What's the plan, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We'll move out while she's dealing with Ouroboros's main forces.+UMP9, continue to use your dummies as bait to delay the enemies that are after us.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Leave it to me. I'll initiate all the simulated signals!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:416, carry Gr G11 to an elevated point at target area R13 to cover our withdrawal.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Roger... 416, be gentle, I don't want to wake up on the way there.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No problem, I'll knock you out before I drag you over there.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:After setting up Gr G11, 416 will head over to assist OTs-14. She'll be leaving with us.+We will wear out Ouroboros until we can destroy its command center.+Keep your comms open, ladies, and let's move out.
