MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Stand by. We'll get in touch again in 30 minutes. +Lee Enfield out.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:What are your thoughts, Miss Lee?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:About what?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Do you believe this is the doing of a ghost?
()||:(Thunderclap) +A massive thunder crashes through the sky just as Tokarev finishes her sentence.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...There are no ghosts in the world, Tokarev.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:But no one can truly say for sure.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:What are you getting at, Tokarev?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:If the culprit really is a ghost, do we stand a chance?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +I've already made myself quite clear the first time, please don't make me repeat myself. +Saying the same thing twice is meaningless, but I'll say it again – there are no ghosts in the world. +A murderous ghost is nothing but a cunning illusion.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Your certainty puts my mind at ease. +Everyone was pretty rattled back in the room. +Sorry for testing you, but you will need an iron will to keep the situation under control.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I understand that we are all taken aback by what happened. +I know how hard it is to keep a cool head when there's been a casualty. +You've done well, Tokarev.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Spasibo.
()||:As they are talking, they open another door.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Is this an archive?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Looks more like a study.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:There seems to be some notes on the desk. Some kind of record?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Should we take a look?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
