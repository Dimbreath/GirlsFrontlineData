AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>I might have... Nyet, it's nothing. I took a detour because I didn't want to be followed.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hm?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Well, whatever. All that matters is that you came.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>...I've been keeping watch for three hours now, and neither the signal source inside the base nor the military forces here have made any abnormal moves.</color>
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>This might just be a backup unit. If only we could hack the systems here and conduct electronic surveillance...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm sorry, if AK-12 was here instead, she'd probably be able to do a better job.</color>
AN94(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't say that sort of thing.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>...I'll sneak in again once it's dark. Help me keep an eye on the movement of personnel in and out of the base.</color>
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Understood.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Wait...!</color>

AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>Something doesn't feel right...</color>
AN94(4);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Something doesn't feel right? Let me do a scan... A vehicle has started up, it's a jeep. But it's not emitting any signals with White Faction characteristics.</color>
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Shake>;AR15Mod(2)||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Nyet... that can't be it. There's something wrong with that vehicle, we have to catch up to it right now!</color>

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏1>:AR-15 has no choice but to abandon her hiding place to chase after AN-94.

NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>;AR15Mod(5)<通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I read you. What's the matter, why are you broadcasting in clear?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>AN-94 ran off by herself to chase a military vehicle, I can't establish a secure channel by myself!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Something's wrong with her, I'm doing my best to catch up with her in case something happens!</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>So we've sighted the big one at last.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The big one?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>94's instincts have always been very accurate. There must be some important clue on that vehicle.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If she's chasing it in such a hurry, then it's very likely that the vehicle's headed straight to the base where the "Node" is being kept.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That doesn't mean she had to run off on her own... I'll catch up and follow the vehicle with her.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If we do find the "Node", should we destroy it immediately?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What on earth could it be...?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>You don't need to know. The moment you find something like it, wait for my order and destroy it on the spot.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Understood.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This channel isn't secure. I'll find some way to contact you after I catch up with AN-94.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>Acknowledged.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'll be waiting for the two of you to contact me again, AR-15.</color>
