BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:It's all over, AR-15...+Creatures on the brink of death...should just stop struggling.
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||:You're not...in much better shape yourself...+Your forces on the outside have been wiped out by our commander. It's just a matter of time for Griffin units to make it out.
AR15(2);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:+Humph. But M4A1 is the only one I'm after...+Perhaps it's about time you handed her over if you don't want me to execute you because I run out patience.
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||:Alchemist... You seem to have overlooked one thing...+I never said...that I had M4A1 with me...
AR15(2);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:...?!
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:I see... I see!
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<震屏><黑屏1>:Hahahahahahaha!+You sure are fascinating, AR-15!+Wonderful! Such heinous and underhanded treachery is exactly the kind of romance I seek!+Pity...that it'll be over soon...+An execution with only you present, no matter the form, is a bit of a bore...

SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>5</BIN>:Keep talking, freak! Keep gloating!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏>:Say something, you bitch! Don't think you can die just like that!
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Stop it, SOP-II. Don't waste time on a corpse.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ha... Sorry. Things have been so tense I lost it a little...
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:(Sighs) That's very like you...+If you hadn't, I'd have thought you're a dummy.

AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Hey, stop squeezing me so tight! I still have injuries on me!
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I finally get to see you again, AR-15...
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:Why are you freaking out so much? It's not like I'd die...+More importantly, how did you find me?+M16 gave you some suicidal ideas again, didn't she?
AR15(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This is the battlefield. Everything we do is a risk, right?+Parapluie can't cut off every kind of connection, AR-15...+...As long as we want to see you.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:...
AR15(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry. The squads trapped by Alchemist have already started evacuating.+Let's get out of here first. We'll think about where to settle you after making sure the way is clear.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:...+Sorry. I can't go back just like this...
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>5</BIN>:Take this drive. All the information I've collected is in there, including M4's hideout...+As well as...the things I want to say to you all...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:AR-15... What are you talking about?+It's okay! I'll move you somewhere safe and 16Lab will come up with something!+Helian said the Parapluie outbreak wasn't your fault so you won't be punished too badly.
SOPII(2);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's not the problem, SOP-II...+You don't understand just how terrifying the situation is. Alchemist was just an insignificant enforcer...+If we don't stop the one behind the whole thing, Sangvis Ferri will consume everyone here!
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:The enemy hiding behind the scenes...+Do we really not stand a chance against her?
SOPII(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Not in our current state, no...+So I must go and meet her. This is the only way of saving everyone.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:AR-15... Are you blaming yourself for what happened here...?
SOPII(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'm stating facts, SOP-II. I'm not doing this out of shame or guilt...+I promise I'll find a solution, so please, you can't stop me.+It's for you, for M16 and M4A1, for everyone here...
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:Then promise me...that you won't do anything stupid...+Can you promise me that, AR-15?!
SOPII(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+I'm doing what must be done.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Hurry, SOP-II. Get out of the jam.+M4 is still waiting for you. Protect her. I'm counting on you...
