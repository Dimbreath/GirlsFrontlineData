NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><BIN>157</BIN><睁眼>:I'm...still alive?
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Da, we're all still alive.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:How?
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Hope has appeared.
NPC-AngeDamage(2);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ange!
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:SOP-II? +Is...is that you?
NPC-AngeDamage(2);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's me! Didn't expect to see me, did you?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:You seem so different. The thing on your shoulder...
NPC-AngeDamage(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh...don't mind me. Just know that I'm your ally. Good evening, Miss Ange.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:Hello... That color scheme looks very familiar. The voice also rings...
NPC-AngeDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sorry. There's a lot of interference in the contamination zone; we couldn't isolate your frequency so we had to rush over here on foot. +After all, the radiation is still spreading erratically and so is the outbreak. As long as we remain in the theater, we can run into ELIDs anywhere.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:416...you came as well?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Surprised?
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:What about the others in Squad 404?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:UMP45 is badly injured, so the others have withdrawn to take care of her. Sorry they didn't have time to say hello.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:That's fine. I'd feel a lot better with the whole squad here, but even you are no match against the military's tanks on your own.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We know, which is why the commander has mobilized the HOCs to help us defend the trench!
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:That might not be enough. As illustrated by the previous encounter, we can only hold off the military's attack temporarily.
AN94(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We've also brought along some comms equipment that we can use to contact the commander, but it'll take some time to assemble. Activating it will also draw the military's attention.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:We clearly don't have time for that. +Yegor is amassing the entirety of the military's remaining forces to annihilate us. They'll have this bunker surrounded in no time.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Da, the military is going to launch the next round of attacks any minute. We must come up with a contingency as soon as possible.
AN94(0);SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We have no choice but to make a run for it now, right? +Let's destroy all enemies in the way while the encirclement isn't complete yet!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(3)||:The military's rear forces will get into position soon so that's too risky. +Maybe we should be stealthier and sneak around their scouts to get out of here.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||:If we fight our way out, we must eliminate all enemies as fast as we can and will possibly have to deal with their reinforcements... +If we sneak out, and their detectors are too perceptive; we could run the risk of being discov—
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Shake>||:Cough...cough! Cough, cough!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange!
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange was caught in the explosion just now. The Collapse Fluid is eating away at her body even more quickly. We're running out of time!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><Shake>||<黑屏1>:Then let's go...cough! +In any case, we must get outta here...cough, cough! +Cough, cough, cough, cough!!
安洁莉娅()<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I can't... my body...is already... +I can't give up... I can't give up! +I can't let them come all this way for nothing! There must be another way!

()||:...Meanwhile, Yegor is observing Ange's hideout.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:That bitch has slinked into the bunkers there. With that infection, she must be trying to slip off to somewhere with less contamination. +The only card in her hand is the few HOCs, but they'll be crushed easily once our main force gets here.
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:Sir, we just received a report. Our artillery force's ETA has been pushed back by 15 minutes.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:...Yegor turns around.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:15 minutes? What's taking them so long? Have they encountered enemies?
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:They have run into a group of ELIDs. They wish to avoid a direct confrontation and are considering taking a detour.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:I thought I'd made myself clear. Destroy all ELIDs on sight. Tell them to get their asses over here.
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:Sir, you should know who these ELIDs are. They—
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker></Speaker><Shake>||:...Yegor grabs his subordinate by the collar.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:I know them better than you, Corporal!
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:...Yegor grits his teeth. The lesions spread across his face make his appearance all the more twisted and disfigured. +Then he loosens his grip, and the subordinate backs off. Yegor sits down on a pile of supply boxes and takes a deep breath.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:I know full well these are my comrades - my brothers. +Many of them have been going through death and destruction by my side for over a decade. The nuclear missiles in WWIII didn't kill us. Not to mention the T-Dolls...we even managed to escape from those true instruments of death. +But today...they died at the hands of that crazy bitch. She detonated a Collapse Fluid bomb just to impede us.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:...Yegor's gaze bore into everyone present.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:I know, wars are supposed to be devoid of honor and emotion, but you should also know...the one who hates the idea of killing these ELIDs the most is the one who has to give the order - ME! +But now, you have all seen for yourselves the damage Collapse Fluid can wreak... That's right, I'll give it to you straight - these brothers are beyond our help. We cannot save them. +All we can do is avenge them, and we could miss our chance because of a minute's delay... +Now, Corporal, do I have to repeat everything I just said to them myself?
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:No, sir. They'll be here right away.
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The corporal speaks into his communicator, and the sound of heavy bombardment comes from a distance.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:May their spirits rest in peace... Now, we seek vengeance from the culprit herself!
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Yegor rises to his feet.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The main force is on its way. Complete the encirclement ASAP and tighten our security. We mustn't let them take a single step out of here before the artillery force completely flattens this place! +We have to destroy them here, and this is our only chance!
