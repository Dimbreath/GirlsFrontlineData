()||<BIN>98</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The battle ends.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Finally...Did we kill her? +Go check her corpse!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll A</Speaker>||:Commander! Miss Kalin! That corpse was just a Dummy!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Eh?! A powerful enemy like that was still just a Dummy?! +Then...where could the real Agent be...?
()||<BIN>98</BIN><震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1>:...Bang!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_stage10</BGM><黑屏2><火花>:...A thunderous explosion blasts me from behind! +Fire falls like rain and smoke fills the air. The darkness spins as I fall. +...... +...
格琳()<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Commander, where are you?! +Answer me, Commander—! +Everyone, put out the flames! And look for the Commander!
()||:... +...I've fallen underground, and the entire command post is burning. +The sound of crisp, elegant footsteps approaches me.
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Humans are so weak... +You're already unable to move after a fall like this.
()||:...I hear the Doll's voice in the darkness and hurriedly raise my sidearm to defend myself.
()||:...Thud! +Something heavy presses down on my chest, making it difficult to breathe.
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:My apologies. That was carelessness on my part. +But don't you think you're acting too surprised?
()||:...The smoke begins to clear, and my vision slowly returns.
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:After all, I did say... +That I would bury you personally...
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<BIN>123</BIN><睁眼>:
()||:...My handgun...is nowhere to be found. 
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:All humans are bound for death, and I am always happy to oblige them. +Two years ago, another Griffin commander confronted me like this. +I wonder who was more pathetic, you or her? I'm sorry, it is hard for me to judge, but in any case, the outcome is always the same...
()||:...I try to struggle, but the Sangvis Doll's strength is far beyond what I can imagine.
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, did that hurt? Still, I'm already being very restrained. It is obvious your chest would not be able to take it if I simply rested my full weight upon it. +And I like it slow...I like to take my time and savor it...
()||<震屏><BIN>122</BIN>:...The weight on my chest grows heavier and heavier, and it becomes harder and harder to breathe.
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Ah... +This is humanity, this is death...
()||:...I can't...breathe anymore.
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Dear Commander... +Your face is becoming more and more beautiful... +This...is the last... +The very last mark you will leave on this world...
()||:...Is this...the end?
()||<黑屏1>:...Click.
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Hold it, Agent! +Let's talk!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>()||:...! +This voice...
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:Nostalgic, huh? You weren't very thorough as a murderer.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:...Why are you still alive?
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's not important. The point is that this Commander must live!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:And why is that?
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Do you...wish to see M4A1?
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:...
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I have a way to let you meet.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Do you think I'll believe you?
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You have to believe me! +All of S.F.'s usable forces have been wiped out, and if you want to fulfil your Mastermind's wish, then let this Commander live. +I will...I will arrange for her to meet you.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:... +For this human?
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I'm human, too. I have my reasons for doing this.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:I cannot understand humans, nor am I inclined to. +I simply wish to enjoy a vacation before the apocalypse comes. +But it would seem...even such a small thing is too much to ask for.
BOSS-8(0);NPC-Ange(0)||:
()||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:...Phew— +...The weight suddenly lifts off my chest.
()||<黑屏2>:...... + ...
代理人()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Whether we are humans or Dolls, work gives us a reason to live. +...Don't you agree, Griffin Commander?
