IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:AUG... have you been waiting here the whole time? Where's the others?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Both G17 and SSG lack the habit of lazing around in the repair bay. They're both outside.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Repair bay... Were we completely annihilated? Did we fail our mission?
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I don't like utilizing the word "run", but that was the last thing you ordered me to do.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Then did we... successfully intercept the Sangvis cargo?
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:We've acquired a lot of intel.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So we did fail...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:What's there to be upset about? Your team didn't get completely wiped out. Your worst fear has not come to life.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Still... I can't seem to get over it at all...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Keep lying in there for all you want. +As the humans are so fond of telling each other, "Sleep. In your dreams, anything is possible."
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Dream... +AUG... I actually... just had a dream.
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Allow me to remind you that T-Dolls cannot dream. +I believe the proper term for it was "computational tests that the Neural Cloud undergoes during reconfiguration".
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I know it wasn't real! Cut me some slack, okay?!
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Mhmm? So what did you dream about? +A sea of flowers in full bloom or World War IV?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:It wasn't anything that grand... +My dream was probably about... another possible outcome of our most recent mission...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So your neural cloud was actively trying to figure out what could be worse than being helpless as Sangvis Ferri plans to massacre people by the millions?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Have you experienced something like this before?
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I never need to. +Sentences that start with an "if" serve no purpose other than grate on the ears.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:(Sighs) I even promised the Commander I wouldn't return empty-handed before we set off... +I just can't let it all go so easily like you...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I have nothing to say if the victories in your dreams bring you satisfaction.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Dreamland is a place where you can have it all without losing anything. A true marvel to behold... +But a wholly unrealistic one.
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:It's good that you're back from there. +Now with your feet firmly grounded in reality, it's time that I give you some bad news to strike at your heart, dear leader.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:UgUgh... I don't want to hear any of it... +We've never had a mission turn out so disastrously before. I don't want to know what the others are saying about us... +Especially that... nasty anonymous dissing forum or something...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:What is it that you want?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Everyone has collected so much intel about this crisis, but we can't even find the cargo...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So do you want to find this legendary weapon of mass destruction, or do you think it's better if we never find it?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:What I want... is to do whatever possible to prevent Sangvis Ferri from wreaking havoc with such a devastating weapon... +For the sake of those who we've sworn to protect... and ourselves.
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Spoken just like the leader of a team which was nearly wiped out. +See to it that you can uphold such an oath before speaking of such things. +Oh, by the way, here's a perfunctory reminder that we have just received our next mission.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Huh...? Wait. I literally just woke up in the repair bay...
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Did I also mention that while we were having this conversation, the Commander was having an emergency meeting with all the team leaders?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN><震屏>:Why didn't you tell me something this important?!
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You couldn't have made it anyway. +The discussion we had about dreams was also very interesting.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Even if I couldn't have made it, we can't just not go entirely! I thought the vice-leader could attend in my place?
IWS2000(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I left early. +As a member on the team that screwed up their mission, my only purpose is to convey the Commander's commendation.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Commendation...? For what? +...Are you making fun of me?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I just told you, didn't I? We acquired a lot of intel.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>22</BIN>:... +...What have we... No, AUG... +What did YOU bring back from the mission?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏1>:My team leader's greatest regret.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:Yellowcake?! +So the intel brought back by the other teams is true?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Ja... AUG's video recording of the sealed container inside of the cargo hold... +Taking the radioactive remains of the convoy into consideration, that is the logical conclusion to come to. +I suppose... we did achieve something during our last mission.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Huh? Don't tell me... what we were seeking was a batch of nuclear missiles?
SSG69(0);IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN>:They weren't fully assembled. It was most likely the raw materials, but we don't know for sure what exactly was inside that container. +However, taking the recent stalemate that we've had with S.F. into consideration, the Commander cannot rule out the possibility that they are attempting to produce such destructive weapons...
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Well, obviously... Biological weapons that would cause epidemics and poison gas are ineffective on us, after all...
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:No need to be so frightened, SSG. +Who knows, maybe they're facing some hard times and can only make a living by selling ores.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...Enough with this irrelevant discussion. +The Commander has just made this information confidential to prevent Dolls like you from panicking.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:That takes the fun out of everything... Now I can't complain about it to the others... +I even just saw a thread discussing this on the "Griffin Anonymous Dissing Forum"...
SSG69(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:MDR made the best out of the timing. +But now all that's left on the page is posts hard-selling the advantages of bullpup rifles.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN>:You yourself are a bullpup rifle, Fräulein AUG...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Fishing for appreciation is something I have no interest in. Whether I'm liked or not by others doesn't concern me.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:IWS, is there something on my face?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>1.5</黑屏1>:No... It's nothing. +We'll form up after sorting our gear. Our teams have been assigned to engage with all suspicious Sangvis outposts. +We'll be working with Squad Welrod, and will be heading out to sortie any minute now. +Our mission must be completed without fail this time...
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:That's right, this time...
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +...Six hours later.
格洛克17()<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:The Sangvis defense ahead is stronger than what our scouts have reported. They don't seem to have noticed us yet.
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Roger that. How are things on your end, SSG?
SSG69()<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:The view is clear. Squad Welrod is waiting for our signal.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:Their security is tighter than what's been reported... I should've anticipated this...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Are you sure you're getting a reading from your radiation detector?
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>10</BIN>:I did think of that. I even... +Huh? Where did I put it...?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:It's with me. You left it on the table after checking it.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Ah... Um... Danke... and sorry about it...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Don't mention it. +The location of this Sangvis outpost, though...
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>10</BIN>:...What about it?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Nothing. Judging from the wind, it's going to rain soon. +Let's get started whenever you're ready, and tie up some loose ends.
