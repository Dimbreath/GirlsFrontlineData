NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Thank you for your hard work on the operation, Commander.+Persica's technical analysis on Jupiter is almost complete. We'll be able to launch a full-scale counterstrike very soon.+However, I summoned you today for a different mission.+Come in, M99.
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>|||:Yes, ma'am.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Good evening, Commander.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>48</BIN><黑点2>:Commander, Sangvis Ferri has been wreaking havoc on Griffin territories with Jupiter, posing a severe threat to the safety of our human settlements.+Even our supply routes and storehouses have been jeopardized, which greatly hinders our efforts in bringing in supplies to the local settlements.+To that end, HQ has decided to dispatch a squad to a storehouse that came under Jupiter's attack so as to salvage any surviving supplies and transport them to a local town.
M99(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:M99 is the T-Doll leader in charge of this operation. Your mission is to guide her and her squad in carrying out the operation.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's an honor to serve with you. I'll be counting on you, Commander!

M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Oh my...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>;M99(0)||:What is it?+The Commander is already on the move. We should also get started.
97typeS(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:True... But...+We're traveling in the dark, Hawk. Aren't you nervous at all?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>;M99(0)||:Not at all. Escort missions are my forte - what's there to be nervous about?+Besides, I've run this route many times before while patrolling with Mosin-Nagant and her friends. We all know it like the back of our hand.
97typeS(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Really... No wonder Miss Helian assigned you to me...+But personally, I can only feel at ease if I can see far ahead, and vision is bad during the night...+I still have much to learn...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>;M99(0)||:Haha, we all have things we're good at and things we're not. Specialization, you know.
97typeS(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:But why must they send me? I'm clearly not fit for such operations.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>;M99(0)||:Jeez, Chief... Things don't always go the way we want. Sometimes we can only accept that and move on.+Don't worry about tonight. You're part of what I'm escorting, and I won't let anyone touch a hair on you!
97typeS(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Very much appreciated. Let's go. We shouldn't keep the others waiting.+Commander, our destination is the storehouse across the mountain. Please lead us on our way.
