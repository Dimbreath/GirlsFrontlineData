M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Yo, all you crooks in your open-crotch pants, time to face the music and hand over all your stuff!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I can't believe they had high-end gear like this, but it's all ours now!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What about the chocolate bars? The sodas? +Do they not eat snacks or something?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Oi, what are you standing around for?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:It's nothing, I'm just reflecting on how we're becoming more and more like robbers as we go on.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Perish the thought, we're wiping out the city's criminals, aren't we?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:But it feels wrong!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:You're just imagining things. When you've been a cop for a long time, you tend to be a workaholic - it's perfectly normal.+Come, after we take out the nearby perps and stock up on supplies, we'll head over to the next district...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Hey! Someone's attacking us from behind!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Are they coming from the library?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Oh, they've got balls alright. It's almost as though they're trying to bait us into the library for a fight.
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:What should we do, Boss?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Well, I wasn't planning to go to the library, but since these assholes are throwing their weight around, we ought to make an example of them. +Come on ladies, time to RUSH B!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, isn't just charging in there too rash? Shouldn't we make sure it's not a trap...eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The squad completely ignores VSK-94's voice of reason and changes direction, charging toward the library with great gusto.+VSK-94 is about to give chase, but then they suddenly double back.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Why are you turning back? Finally realized the importance of caution?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:The word caution doesn't exist in my vocabulary. It's just that there's one thing we haven't done yet.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:One thing?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:P7!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Yes, Boss!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Ka-click.
ART556(6)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>35,30</Position>||:Yessssssssss! +Hearing that music makes me feel like victory's at hand!
P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>;ART556(6)<Position>35,30</Position>||:Exactly!
P7(6)<Position>0,70</Position>;VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Who are the real crooks here, anyway?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:What, are you going to chicken out now?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I just don't want to disgrace myself after leaving my job as a police officer.+Still, this is just a game, so I'll take things as they come.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:That's right! She sure learns quick~+Now gather up, ladiess! Let's go!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:—Outside New York Public Library.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene1</BGM>:Well, this is a buzzkill. It's like revving up for a good long peel down the highway and you break down before the light turns green. +Speaking of which, with such sloppy gunplay, we could be standing in front of them and they would still shoot themselves in the ass. Aren't there any decent crooks left in Manhattan?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:What I want to know is why would they shoot at us from so far away?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Looks like the Boss can't answer that.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Boss, looks like there are still enemies inside the library. We need to figure out a way to open the main door, though.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Maybe there's a key nearby which can open the lock...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Key? No need for that crap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ART556 and P7 realize what's happening and make way. M870 walks up to the library door and shoots off the lock before kicking it open.+Just as expected, there's a bandit holding a shotgun behind the door, but just as M870 is about to open fire, he is shot in the vitals from behind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The enemy collapses, revealing a girl with twintails, wearing a black cape with a red inner lining and holding an automatic rifle.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:... +Er, hi?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Police!+Now reach for the sky unless you want a few more holes in you!
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Huh? B-but I didn't do anything!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She tries to bargain her way out of it, but seeing that M870 still has the barrel of her gun trained on her, she obediently complies.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Are you another player? I didn't expect you to surrender right away.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hey, new girl, don't be fooled. Some people just love to play the innocent in front of you before ambushing you while your back is turned.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I can relate!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:By "some people" you mean "yourselves", right?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:97, we're about to move out, what's the hold...+Who are these people?
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:12! It-it's the police!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:The police? You mean that midget nun and that dog-eared brat over there?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:These are FOX ears, hello!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Whatever. We're leaving.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;AA12(0)||:My oh my, we've got a mean-looking character here. Are those rings around your eyes from dodging arrest warrants day and night?
M870P(0);AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...Hah?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:The hell do you mean "Hah?" You have three seconds to surrender and hand over your supplies!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:97, what's going on here?
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Miss Springfield! We-we're being robbed by the police!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Hey, since when were there cops in video games?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:There are now.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><SE1>Select</SE1>:M870's posse of self-proclaimed constables on patrol raise their guns in unison and point them at Springfield.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Point your gun at them too, junior!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Uh, I'm sorry, I'm not used to pointing my gun at people who aren't suspects or violent criminals.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Don't worry, they will be soon enough.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:You accuse people of being violent while resorting to violence yourselves. You make me sick. Still, things being what they are, there's no room to negotiate, right?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:A moment, please. We should try to avoid fighting if we can help it.+You want supplies, right? As it happens, we have a lot of them. If these are acceptable...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With some quick tinkering, several columns of light appear in front of her.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:We have winter clothing...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>;M1903(10)||:Humph, you think you can buy us off so easily?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:How naïve, we're friends of justice, you know!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...And lots of chocolate and soda too.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Well... I'm starting to think Miss Springfield must have her own reasons~
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Yup yup, how could such a kind-hearted big sis be a suspect, heeheehee~
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||:She bought you off in the end, didn't she?!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Pfffft, your minds are slower than the old wind generators in the Yellow Zones, aren't they?+If she's got all those supplies, it means she must be loaded. In that case, why settle for the scraps she gives you when you can just take it all?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Look, even if you say that...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:A cop's gotta do what a cop's gotta do!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Correct! Time for a seizure of assets!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...You sure play fast and loose with things.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:I control my minions better than you think. Loyalty is a thing that you can regain with just a little generosity. Simple, don't you think?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Can't say I agree.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Pffft, you'll just have to get used to it, then!+Now, let's count up their sins!+I can't believe they actually loaded this poor librarian into a sack and beat him up in order to rob the place!
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Librarian?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I'm talking about this poor, pitiful man lying on the ground!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh my, you're starting to sound a bit unreasonable.
MP7(4)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:No matter how you slice it, that guy was an enemy that either you or Type 97 bumped off, right?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:From now on, he's a librarian~!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Tsk, so it's a setup, then?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:It's called "upholding justice", and it's part of the game of cat and mouse. Even if you say you weren't present at the scene of the crime, I'll drag the police line to wherever you're standing.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:I've had it with this.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:AA-12, you should avoid conflicts that can be avoided. At the very least, we need to make our position clear to the other party.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...+M870, I don't think a simple breaking and entering warrants a firefight, right?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:You think so? Then we'll add "assaulting an officer" to it, then.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Since you're playing the role of a police officer, there's no need to attack non-hostile people, don't you think?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:By the time you realize they're hostile, you'll be the one on the ground.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I have my standards in passing judgment!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Oh, don't get all preachy with me at a time like this. Look at you, you're like a freshly-hatched chick with no idea what's going on, even if you ARE holding a gun.+Your mistake is thinking that the world is a wonderful and perfect place. I can fix that for you later on, but for now, get your ass out of the way of my gun barrel!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb</SE1>:Cyk—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:As the standoff continues, a flashbang suddenly detonates between the two squads.+For players, being flashbanged means their vision will be scrambled for a short while. It's not fatal, but when the tension in the air is so thick you could cut it with a knife—
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>GF_xDivision_Battle1</BGM>:Whoa, wait! Cease fire!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Uwah!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Who's shooting?! Who's shooting?!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:No can do, they were aiming to use force in the first place!
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:You bad cops threw the flashbang, right?!
MP7(4)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Urgh, shouldn't we fall back now?+Even if we don't, why don't we get to cover first?
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I guess things are out of control...+In any case, let's get out of here. Come, 97. Quickly now.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Ah, okay!

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Ahhh! The criminals are getting away!+How could you let such big fish escape, P7?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:For chocolate bars—!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Wait! Don't just run off on your own!+M870, we need to go after them.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:You have the right to remain silent!
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<Shake>0.1</Shake>:Your vision's pretty much recovered, right? Stop shooting into the air!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Ah? So you were here.+What did I tell you? By the time they show hostility, it's too late.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I don't care about Springfield and that lot, but ART556 and P7 were carrying almost all of our ammo and gear. Don't you think we should get them back?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:They'll be fine. If you ask me, they'll catch up with us in three minutes' time.+Alright, let's move on!
