()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...A few minutes ago, on the other side of the battlefield.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Fräulein Kar definitely won't be able to make it... Then we have to do this ourselves.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:How can we do this ourselves? +If we so much as LOOK at a Sangvis ringleader, we'll have to reinstall our neural cloud.
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Hmm...so should we stick to the original plan? +But they're already exchanging fire, which means Gager won't run over my booby traps... +Besides, I didn't actually have the time to plant the explosives!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Then let's retreat for now? +Isn't it better to let the elite handle this?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:But some other Dolls are being attacked! +If we don't do something, they could be wiped out!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:That might be true...but we'd also be wiped out if we charge in without a plan...
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:C-calm down... Think of something... +Oh, right! We can do this!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Several minutes later...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:D-don't shoot! I surrender!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Look, I can't run anymore. +I surrender, and I'm dropping my weapon.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager approaches MP41 warily.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She actually didn't fire. I seriously thought she was gonna shoot me down just like that.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Now I just need to wait for her to come close.</color>
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker><Shake>||:Don't hurt me, I'm completely harmless...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:... +...Or not!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:...On a hill in the distance.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Never saw that coming, did you, Sangvis idiot! That's just one of my Dummies. +I've rigged half of the explosives onto her. The moment you close in... +Hehehehe...
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Are you sure she'll fall for it...?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑点1>:This is a plan that I've been perfecting for months, a dumb Sangvis won't be able to see through it!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Gager walks up to MP41's Dummy...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;MP41(0)||<黑点1>:She grabs her by the neck and lifts her right off the ground.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点2>:With that, I'll be Griffin's new star! +Detonate!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...... +...No reaction in the distance.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Huh...?
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:...
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑点1>:What?! +Why didn't it go off?  +I've clearly pushed the button... Why isn't the Dummy obeying my command?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:A new Griffin Doll. Here I thought it was a friend of that piece of junk who's been trying to bait me...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Turns out it's just another piece of trash.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Could it be Sangvis interference?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Ja, that...that must be it! +Crap, I completely forgot about that! +W-what should I do now? I think I screwed this up.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||<黑屏1>:I told you it's impossible for us to defeat a Sangvis ringleader! +Can we just go?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:...Meanwhile, 98k is at her sniping position.

98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:...

98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:20%. +There's still a 20% chance that the shot can penetrate her armor.

98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:If it's a Dummy, then her mainframe must be somewhere nearby. +If this shot does the job, then we can all go home safely. +But...if it doesn't kill her, Gager will do whatever she can to find me. +Get MP41 away from there when Gager comes for me.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It isn't our job to rescue that Doll.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>We can repeat our previous steps and complete the mission.</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:If we abandon our companions without a thought, how are we different from Sangvis Ferri? +Besides, it is my fault that MP41 is running around where she shouldn't be... Please remove her from danger. I'm using our last resort.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you crazy?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You want to tackle Gager on your own?</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:You know I can do it. Worst case, it's easier to retreat alone.

It's your call.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm sure you know this already, but I still have to say it before I go.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You should've told that mischief maker to scram in the first place.

98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:I'll reflect on that when I return. Now move.

()||:StG44 darts into the woods swiftly and disappears into the darkness.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right, it's a long shot – literally. +I must hit the core in her torso or the other Sangvis units will remain active.
()<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Take aim...

()||:The bullet zips through the air and is about to hit its mark in Gager's chest... +But Gager deflects it with her weapon at the last second.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager runs her finger over the slightly dented feedway on her weapon and looks toward 98k's sniping position.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Was that from more than a kilometer away...? +Her aim was true even when shooting from that distance. Finally, a Griffin Doll that's more like it. +Just you wait...I'm going to get you, then I'll make you tell me everything I need to know.
()||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Meanwhile, back to MP41.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Another gunshot... That sounded like 98k! +Is Fräulein Kar actually nearby?
