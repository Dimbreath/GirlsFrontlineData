UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Sier! Answer me, Sier! +Have you guys figured anything out yet? Why can't 45... +...be rebooted at all?!
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uh, um... Please don't panic...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's just that...well...</color>
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Argh, shut up! I shut down her Level II consciousness to save power!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Stop bothering me; I'm remotely giving her emergency maintenance right now!</color>
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Will 45 live?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Griffin logistics officer did a good job.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, even with the minimal power supply secured, we can only save a few core modules and buy her some time.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You'll need to move her to a more advanced repair facility for me to sort this out completely!</color>
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:There's no such facility here. We'll need transport to move 45. Could you arrange for that, Sier?
UMP9(4);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm sorry...but your coordinates are way too dangerous at the moment.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>According to intel, the area is embroiled in conflict among different forces and heavily contaminated by Collapse Fluid. Your temporary base is also under attack...</color>
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:It can't be done?
UMP9(2);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, it can, anyone willing to take such risks is bound to be pretty expensive...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>As you know, our capital reserve...</color>
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:I don't care how much it costs; just get the best extraction team here ASAP!
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>U-understood! I'll do that right awa—</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Beep!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>9, how's 45 doing?!</color>
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:I was just talking to Sier and Dier. 45 will probably have to be transferred soon!
UMP9(4);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You can't do that now! The enemies have breached the base!</color>
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Is it that bad?!
UMP9(4);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're buying time for the Commander's reinforcements, though I'm not sure what exactly that is.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>In any case, keep 45 safe with Gr G11, they might break through our defense lines any time.</color>
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:I will, but 416... +You know that you no longer owe 45 anything, right?
UMP9(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know. She said so.</color>
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:So...is it time?
UMP9(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>All I want is to prove myself.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But first of all, I must make sure you all survive.</color>
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Then... we are counting on you, we WILL save 45 here.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Are you alright over there, 416?
G11(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Commander is here, and we have a lot of T-Dolls.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Make sure you stay alive. We'll meet again.</color>
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Even though we don't know when, right? +I just hope...we'll get to fight together one last time.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Not this time. I can't carry you on my back anymore.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Transmission terminated.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>bossbattle_loop</BGM>:...Not to mention, you won't be of much help here anyway. +Scheiße! How the hell can we penetrate their armor?! And what the hell are they?!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Save your bullets, this is exactly what I meant. They have force fields designed especially to deflect our ammunition. It's practically impossible to get through them. +But thanks to you, we can at least organize a counterstrike behind the defense line.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're very welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Bang bang!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:416, I just want to say that I'm very sorry about what I said. Also... +You're pretty dependable...and a lot more capable than all the T-Dolls on the base now.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Just do your job; I only care about orders on the field.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Now that you mention it, 416, you remember the Commander's order?
AK74U(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Draw the enemies' attention, slow them down, and don't let them find our extraction point.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:That's right, if we can't do that, it's over. +416, our mission is to buy time till the Commander's "reinforcements" get here, not to destroy the enemy, so I don't think we have to stand our ground here—
AK74U(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We still don't know when the so-called "reinforcements" will arrive so count on getting lucky. +Besides, we don't even know how much we can count on them.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:In any case, we can't win on our own, right?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:One moment you wanna charge in blindly, the next you wanna retreat like a coward, what kind of T-doll are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Bang bang!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I was just making a suggestion, since you said so, I'll stay with you. +I just think we should trust the Commander. After all, you don't have a command module, and this place is not the most defendable...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The Commander is still busy mobilizing these "reinforcements". Once that's done, I'll hear from...
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Click.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Ah, here they come.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Fire at will, don't fall back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Commander, we can't stay holed up here! +We can barely hold them off for now, they'll break through other strongpoints in no time!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||: +<c>I'm working on it! <c>You think I haven't prepared for that? <c>Just hold out for a bit longer, help is on the way!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支><黑屏1>:Please hurry up! The extraction point will be done for once the enemy realizes that our numbers are pitifully small!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支><黑屏1>:Whatever you have planned, I hope it works!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支><黑屏1>:I sure hope this won't be the last order I ever get!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1><黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:<color=#00CCFF>Anyway, we'll obey your order and slow the enemies down...so that the reinforcements can get here safely! </color> +<color=#00CCFF>But Commander, what exactly are these "reinforcements"? Can they really fight off the enemy? </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Sorry, it's not that I don't trust you, I simply don't want... </color> +<color=#00CCFF>...Nevermind. I'll focus on the mission at hand. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>Time is running out, here's our objective again: we must strengthen our defense line within the time limit to ensure our reinforcements' safe arrival at the base!</color>
