NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Commander, please come over here. We've received an anonymous message.
Commander()||:What is it?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Information provided by WAVE Tech. It seems to be an audio recording this time?
Commander()||:Is this WAVE reliable?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hmm, it is indeed a very mysterious company. They have been giving us information without demanding any payment. We correspond through emails but the sender's address is always randomized and untraceable. +However, all the intelligence they have supplied so far proved to be accurate. It's uncertain why they're aiding us, but I think they should be on our side.
Commander()||:I hope it isn't another trap... Play the audio recording.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay!

()||:【Congratulations, my esteemed comrade. You put on quite a spectacular show in Belgrade, Chief.】
()||:【What have you heard now, you wily old fox?】
()||:【Oh, nothing - nothing whatsoever. You simply appear to have made an incredible sacrifice. Now both the general public and the political circle of the Pan-European Union are moved by our government's great sincerity and competence.】+【Protecting their ambassador at the cost of our own senior official's life - how absolutely touching. It's so perfect it almost feels premediated.】
()||:【Humph, the plan went terribly wrong though. "Vympel" was this close to storming the city.】
()||:【"It's a bit of a shame, but there's no point in holding Belgrade. Besides, we already have the Pike Node. Thank goodness K was desperate enough to make such a risky move. The absence of Statesec forces actually made it easier to disassociate ourselves from this whole business." I bet that's what you're thinking, am I right?】
()||:【You prattle too much, Havier.】
()||:【Sorry. Then let me tell you something you'd like to know.】+【You'd better extend your gratitude to that Griffin Commander. The Pan-European Union is so appreciative of the protection Chairwoman Ulrich received under those circumstances that they've already convinced Milošević and the representatives of the other countries in Southern Europe. That's really good news.】+【Of course, that young lady is also a very gifted diplomat. Still, despite the many demands that she has successfully lobbied on the Union's behalf, the two Intercontinental Railway construction projects are still going to be undertaken on terms that are acceptable to us.】
()||:【Humph, it's not as if they could afford to refuse the deal. The two railway projects are more in line with the Union's interests. That bastard caught wind and shoved that extremely green German young lady out as a scapegoat so that he wouldn't have to deal with this himself.】+【He was banking on the fact that if Ulrich had died, the Pan-European Union would have been in the position to make exorbitant demands. What a sleazy crook. But never mind that now. Tell your intermediary that the Central People's Committee is very happy with how the situation has turned out.】
()||:【I bet the folks sitting in the first three rows are even happier about your success in crushing the activities of the Moscovite radicalists and the Military, isn't that right, comrade?】
()||<黑屏1>:【As I said, you prattle too much. This conversation ends here.】
