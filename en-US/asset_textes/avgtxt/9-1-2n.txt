T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...T77 waves her hand in front of T65's face.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:...
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:T65, are you spacing out?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:Spacing out...? +Ah... Oh! +Why would I space out in a place with active enemies?! Don't be silly, T77!
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Right, my bad, my bad. +But according to the scouts, this area is secure.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:Is it...? +...
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...Are you waiting for someone?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:Look, T77. On the other side of the hill... +Do you think... Miss M16 is waiting behind that fog...?
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Why would she be hiding behind the fog? +You think she isn't impressed by the convoy that's here to welcome her home?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:Perhaps...
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Don't think too much of it. +Where's Garand?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:She's helping M3 with the makeup. Probably gonna be done soon.
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:... +Am I the only one who thinks this might be too much for M3 to handle?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:Don't worry about that. She's the best choice for this task. +Like I said, don't think too much.
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...I guess I should be more worried about who's playing M16...
()<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:We're ready.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Finally! +Let me see!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Never mind.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:I nitpicked a little bit earlier, but now it's flawless even under intense scrutiny! +You don't have to be so stiff, Miss M3. Just relax.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:U-Um... I mean... +Even though my voice has been altered... I'm not so certain that I can completely imitate Miss M4's tone...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Don't worry. We can dub over it with recordings in post-production. +For now, we simply have to make the visuals convincing. +Have you memorized the script, M3?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:I did... +But my co-star Miss AK-47 isn't here yet, so I'm not sure if I'm ready for this...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Is AK-47 still not here? +I was just wondering if she'd sought you out directly.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Huh? I thought she was with you...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Uh-oh. We're done for.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Did she... forget about this?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:That can't be. I've reminded her repeatedly to come here right after she returns to base... +Let me ask Miss Makarov...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Well, if AK-47 isn't drinking, she's on her way to get drinks. +She's most definitely forgotten all about this.
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...Being drunk is a big no-no in acting.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:You think so? +AK-47 would at least take this seriously...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Who knows? No matter what she's up to, we must finish filming this soon.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:You got in touch? +Well? When is AK-47 coming?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:...I definitely did, all right. +Miss AK-47... +She...
