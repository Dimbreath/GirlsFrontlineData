UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Miss Helian, do you copy? +S.F. has located us. What is the status of the rescue party?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:Weather conditions are improving. +The heliports in the area are now fully operational.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Finally, some good news.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:So we can use the heliports anytime, right?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:Yes, but only in this area. +And our rescue party is going to arrive later than expected as mobilizing such large forces hinders our efficiency.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Couldn't you send a team to aid us first?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:Our recon team has spotted new Sangvis forces in the vicinity. +They are very likely to be a Sangvis unit's backup, so it's very risky to just dive in. +Contact me again after you come up with a specific plan of action. We'll do our best to coordinate with you.
()||:Connection broken.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So...if we don't hurry up, we're gonna be fenced in?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then let's just run for it!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've used up too many supplies. +It'll be incredibly hard to break through the Sangvis base in our current condition, especially considering the possibility of fighting against two Ringleaders.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I know where the supply outpost is in this area, but getting there is gonna take a while. +Besides, if a Sangvis Ringleader decides to actively search for us...
M1887(0)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker>||:Leave it to us. We'll stall the encircling forces. +Our aircraft was shot down by Jupiter around here, so we know this area. +And we've been relying on your command throughout the entire operation. We, too, want to be of use.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +I understand. Then please lend me your strength.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:45, please give me the shortest route to the supply outpost. +We're moving immediately.
