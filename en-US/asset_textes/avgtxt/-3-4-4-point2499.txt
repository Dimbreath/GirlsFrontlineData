UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:What are you looking at, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Some...new discovery. +Look, that artillery station there only has a single Jupiter cannon installed.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:How come...? Did S.F. go on strike halfway through the construction?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Simple. The AR Team accidentally wandered into the Sangvis cannon testing ground. +Many cannons aren't installed in time...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:New idea, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I think we can break through those incomplete cannons with what we have. +That's gonna save us a lot of time and resources.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Sure, let's do it. +But make proper observation beforehand and don't go charging at full-fledged cannons!
()||:【HINT】Some cannon nodes are significantly impaired and easier to confront directly. Observe and strategize accordingly.
