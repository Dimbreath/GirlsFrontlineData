NPC-Persica(3);RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：You've already consumed too much coffee for the night. It is detrimental to human health.+Besides, I think I heard you muttering about something...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;RO635(3)||：Uh... I just happened to receive a voicemail. Don't worry about it.
NPC-Persica(3);RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Sighs) This is a significant operation. As the person in charge, please stay focused.

M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Hmm? Did I miss something?+I was just taking over from SOP-II upstairs.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Ah, it's fine. But make sure you tell me next time...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Commander, I've marked a command post on the map. Taking it will draw the attention of most enemy forces.+We will proceed to the database after you succeed in your mission.+The anti-jamming system is running smoothly. You may begin anytime.
