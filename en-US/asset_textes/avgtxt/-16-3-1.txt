M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:... +I... Where am I...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏2>:...! + This... +A...AR...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:Don't squirm. +You're really heavy.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:... +Is that...really you?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:Don't move your head. Hearing my voice should be enough, right?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:Why... +...I don't believe it! +AR-15... You...you're alive?!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:Let's get out of here first. I'll explain it to you afterward.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:But why... Why did you show up here and now...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:I have a mission of my own. Running into you was simply a coincidence. +But...I guess it's not a bad thing.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:Put me down, I'll walk on my own.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:I wouldn't need to carry you if you could walk.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:...?! +My body...is not responding...?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN><SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:If you want to blame someone for it, she's standing beside me... +Something went wrong when she disconnected you. It caused slight damage to your neural module, so your ability to move has been temporarily restricted.
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:Da, da, it's kind of my fault, which is why I'm carrying this case for you. +Still, it's also your own people's fault for installing such sophisticated modules in an outdated T-Doll, right?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:That's... Whose voice is that?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:Tactical Doll AK-12, from Task Force DEFY.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:DEFY...? What do you do? +AR-15, are you one of them now?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:I've got a new employer. Don't really have much choice in the matter. +Her name's Angelia. You've met her before.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN>:Ange...lia...? +...You mean the woman who helped me enter the combat zone? +How about the others? +What about SOP-II...and RO?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN><SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:...Now's not the time to think about them. Sangvis elites are still around. +Focus on what's in front of you, keep quiet, and fall back with me.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN><黑屏1>:... +SOP-II... +RO...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0.8</黑屏2><黑屏1>2</黑屏1>:I...remember... +I saw RO and...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:No! I can't...I can't leave them behind! +Put me down! Let me go back!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Keep still! In your current condition, S.F. will capture you before you can take more than a few steps if I let you go!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:And whose fault is it that I'm like this?!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏2><SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:We had no choice but to sever your Level II connection in order to break the link between you and the people monitoring you.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:The people monitoring me? +...Who? Who's monitoring me?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:Did you really think Sangvis Ferri was our only enemy?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:What...What exactly is going on... +Isn't Griffin's mission...to wipe out Sangvis Ferri...? +I...I abandoned my teammates and my objective...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏1>:Whatever you want to do, get some rest first. +We'll give you the power you want after that...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:M4?
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:There was too much strain on her neural cloud. She couldn't sustain her Level I surface consciousness.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2>:What a mess... +Go on, AK-12. Tell me what you found on the scene...
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Nothing but bad news. +First off, M4 SOPMOD II's missing. I'm certain she's not in the vicinity, and there were no clues around which could tell us about her current status.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:...
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Was I too direct?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Better to be more direct... +How about RO? I saw her...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:...AK-12 sighs.
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:RO635 has completely ceased to function, so...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:... + I...I won't forgive them for this. +Also, about what I said regarding the recovery of the fallen Dolls' neural module...
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:RO635's was completely removed. +I'm certain it happened after she was killed.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:... +Could this be good news...
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Look on the bright side. Maybe SOP-II avoided the ambush and left with RO's neural module. +Would you be satisfied with that answer?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:... +I would very much like to assume that is the case.
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Naturally, I'd advise you against having that idea, lest you end up disappointed. +But this is no time to think about others. +There are two S.F. squads around us, at 11 o'clock and five o'clock respectively. The terrain nearby is such a mess so we can't go around them. We'll probably have to take them out.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Can you really scout the battlefield while making small talk?
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Are you looking down on me, or overestimating yourself?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏1>:Neither. We'll let the results of the battle speak for themselves.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:(M4...if you knew the state the AR Team was in...) + (What...would you do?)
