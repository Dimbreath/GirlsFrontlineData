破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoaaaa!!
()||:Destroyer stumbles and crashes right into the ground.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Where?! Where did that come from?!
()||:BANG!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Tsk! It ricocheted. That armor is too thick.
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't stop. Keep up the suppressive fire.
()||:BANG! BANG!
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Whoa! That was way too close. Thank goodness I'm back on my feet! +Dammit! How are they still moving without any orders from UMP45?!
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||:There are too many possibilities to count. No use thinking about that. +How far are you from the target? Are you within three kilometers?
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:Hmm... Pretty sure I am! I've been pumping it you know?!
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good. Then let's enjoy the show!
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:UMP45, I'll relish every face you make...
()||<BIN>3</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Meanwhile.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Sorry, 9. We failed.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That dog's armor is too thick. We weren't able to deal any effective damage. +It would be great if we have another sniper with stronger firepower.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:That's fine. Our new friends are getting Gd DSR-50. We still have plenty of opportunities. +Continue with the guerilla tactic, Gr G11. Don't let Destroyer's Dummies reach you and wait for another chance.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't you need any cover? The objective of retrieving the drone rests entirely on you...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:I'm very good at this kind of job. Save your worries for 45. +Who knows how she's doing...
()||<BIN>55</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Meanwhile.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I can't get in touch with the team, but judging from the gunshots just now, Gr G11 has probably figured out what to do. +In that case, destroying that big dog is only a matter of time as long as they can keep it tied up. +Now the question is...whether I can keep this up...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ugh... Dammit... Here it comes again... +But...I can take it... +What's...this... +Sangvis Ferri...again...?!
()||<黑屏1>:...
系统提示()<Speaker>System Notice</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Training over. Please vacate the machine. +UMP45... +Your results are atrocious. +Recalibrate your equipment and condition and prepare for another session.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I just can't do it... +My accuracy has gone below 30%...
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:How on earth can I do better...? +I train as hard as everyone else, but my body just keeps messing with me. It's always a beat behind other people...
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Oh, hi there, newbie!
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Uh, commander...greetings.
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Haha, cut out the formality. Come sit down! +And do I look like a commander? Never got that before!
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh? Don't tell me...you're also a T-Doll?
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Is it weird? Maybe I'm too expressive? That's pretty much the only good thing about me... +Heheh, anyway, I'm a new recruit just like you! Guess we'll have to take care of each other!
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ah...sure... +And thank you...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(0)||:No biggie. We're companions, so we have to cheer each other up! +Ah, can I sit here?
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yeah...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Well, are you feeling better? It's only one or two sessions. Don't let the results drag you down! +After all...that's not really your forte!
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What? How do you know...about that?
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Don't freak out. I just saw your shooting practice when I was passing by. +Your posture, reflexes and accuracy all show that you don't have any advanced fire control system installed.
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So...it's that obvious...
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:That's why you must not force something that you physically can't do! +You think such crazy drills even work on T-Dolls?
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's got to help, more or less! My result has improved in the last few days! +(Mutters) Though...it went down again today... +At this rate, I won't make the deadline of the compatibility test with the new commander...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(2)||:Don't take it too seriously! There must be a job where you can make use of your strengths here.
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I...just want to be chosen by the commander... +Otherwise, I have no purpose as a T-Doll...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||<黑屏1>:Nothing to say to that, huh? +Doesn't matter. I'm probably the only useless T-Doll here anyway... +You don't have to concern yourself with my fate...
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Pffft! +Hahaha!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Laugh all you want. I know I'm a pitiful sight.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sorry, but haven't you figured it out yet? +I'm just as useless as you!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What? How could that be? Are you also...
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Here, check our imprinted weapons! +Our clouds may have been wiped, but we're the products of the same hapless factory.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Really...? Then you, too...
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right. I, too, have a bunch of weird electronic warfare modules installed for whatever reason, so I can't hold a gun properly either... +But what a coincidence that I ran into you while I was just strolling around!
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2>:I'm UMP40, your elder sister by name and by fate, so I'll be sure to have your back!
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh? Have...my back?
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:We are poor birds of a feather that have suffered the same fate ever since we were manufactured. We're practically obliged to be friends, you know?
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But is it necessary for T-Dolls to make friends...? That's so weird...
UMP40(4)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Jeez, aren't you a thick one... +We're all equipped with emotion simulation software, right? That means humans want us to be like actual people outside of fighting! +And all actual people must have a friend or two, right?
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're...not wrong, but how is that beneficial for our work?
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:The computational speed of two stupid T-Dolls combined is still higher than a normal T-Doll, right? +The future has a lot of hardships in store for us. From our missions, our superiors, other T-Dolls...but we can face them together! +Oh, is the commander still waiting for you? Don't you have to do another training session?
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, uh...
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 checks the channel.
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Sighs) He's already logged off. I have nothing to do...
UMP40(5)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Humph, such a meanie! +How can a bigoted man who looks at nothing but performance be a commander?! +Maintaining rapport with your T-Dolls is more important than anything else!
UMP40(5);UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't say that. A commander's decisions and orders are all absolute. +I guess...I'm simply not qualified to build up rapport with the commander in my present state.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(1)||:Don't beat yourself up like that. How about some word of advice? +Not that it's anything special...
UMP40(2);UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Laughs bitterly) I've got nothing to lose... +So please give me some guidance!
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(0)||:Well, you don't have to be so reverent with me. We're sisters now. Best friends. Got it? +First of all, you must get rid of all that negativity radiating from your very being! +Know that nothing will change if you keep moping.
UMP40(3);UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Haha. +You're practically telling a person with a broken bone to go get some exercise, or a chronically depressed human to be optimistic... +That's easier said than done. I want to cheer up too. It's not like I want to be down in the dumps forever...
UMP40(4)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>;UMP45_Young(0)||:Don't worry. I'll help you! I'm an expert in maintaining a positive outlook!
UMP40(4);UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Really?
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>61</BIN>:Everything will get better. Trust me! +And this is the first step!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh? What's this?
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Give my fist a bump. There, that's a promise. +Trust me, and I promise...
UMP40()<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I promise that everything will change some day...

破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Huh? Did something go wrong? +Can't be an issue with Parapluie, can it?
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Impossible. I spent a long time making sure... +Hold on... +The orders I just issued...all got rejected by UMP45's authorization!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:So... Parapluie didn't alter her Zener Protocol into our OGAS Protocol at all...
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:No... This is definitely a connection established with OGAS Protocol. The signal under Zener Protocol has vanished completely. +I'm being rejected because I don't have the command authorization...
