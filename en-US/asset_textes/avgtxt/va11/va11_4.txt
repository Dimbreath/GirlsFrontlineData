Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>186</BIN><BGM>m_va_hopes_and_dreams</BGM>:Hey, Jill. +I'm stepping outside to buy something. Want me to pick up anything for you?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I bet that you're going to buy those electronic Dinergates.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:And a lot of souvenirs. Those Griffin people really know how to make a buck.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Can you help me get a robomaid, too? +Fore messed up the clothes I folded with all the ease of me going out to get a pack of cigarettes.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but I just saw the news and all the slots for Griffin's domestic rental service are sold out. +You can sort it out by hand or get another cat. I wouldn't recommend the latter though; Fore's just too cute.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I don't want to do it myself, so I've decided to forget it all and throw myself into my work.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You're just running away from the problem. Your room won't clean itself when you go back tonight.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:But my feelings can recover by themselves, just a little.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Then I hope your customers tonight won't be too taxing. I'll leave the place to you, Jill.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:See you later, Boss.

吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>186</BIN>:Time to mix drinks and change lives.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Good evening, Jill.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Alma—! +Oh no, I'm sorry. +Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Enough of that, Jill! All I need is a proper "Good evening".
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:You can ask me to be courteous, but not to know my limits.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Hehe, as it happens, I have a friend here who is completely fluent in etiquette. She'll teach you how far you can go, Gr G36— +...Gr G36?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ah...my apologies. +Good evening, Jill Stingray. +It is good to meet you, and I hope you will have a happy night.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Alright, I know now that etiquette is deliberately saying things that sound nice but aren't too trustworthy. +But good lord, I can't believe you actually managed to get ahold of the maid rental service. I wanted one tonight.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:I won't give her to you, because she's just too perfect, both as a maid and as a companion.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(I've seen way too many strange Dolls these past few days, so idealized androids like these end up surprising me instead...)
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:And I don't just have one of them, I've got many bodies in store, and I've changed them all into different clothes according to the manual.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Sounds like you're already treating them as your daughters. But that's being hasty, Alma. you're being far too hasty.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Give it a rest, Jill. Every girl enjoys something like this, and I bet a lot of men do too.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I'd choose to raise a cat. Anyway, you really have been gone for a while, Alma.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Don't bring it up, I've been so damn busy lately that I've only managed to step out to catch a breath tonight. +Start with a Brandtini. I haven't had one of them in far too long, darling.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No problem, my Brandtini girl.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Let's give Alma the Brandtini she likes. She came here for this and for me.) +<va11><perfect>6
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:What can I say? I'm never disappointed when I come here. +Are you the best bartender in Glitch City, Jill?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:No, but I'm sure that I'm the bartender in Glitch City that treats you best.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So, why don't you tell me about what's been keeping you busy lately? Does it have anything to do with this Doll maid?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Debugging work. +Griffin Dolls use technology that I rarely come into contact with. Their tech is very...90wish...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:90-what?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:90wish. They're a secretive tech group from many years ago.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Can I take that to mean that they're a team of hackers?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:No, they were far more than hackers. Their knowledge of the field of artificial intelligence was extremely advanced. +One of their core members founded 16Lab with the help of IOP, and provided technical support for the development of Griffin's Dolls. +You should know that anyone who works in the electronics industry would be interested in the secrets inside their heads.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So that's why you accepted the work of debugging this Doll?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:While the clarification was a little unnecessary, everything I did during the course of this job was completely legal.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Ah...Alma...
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Hm?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Er... I'm sorry, did I say something wrong? +Miss Maid over here looks a little...angry? And she seems to be avoiding me?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Don't worry, she just has a mean look in her eyes and she's a little farsighted. It's just a factory design, so don't let it bother you.
Alma(2);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I apologize for my rudeness, Miss Jill. I simply wanted to see your face clearly.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:It's alright, I like glaring at people from time to time myself... +(What kind of mad scientist would make a Doll farsighted...)
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:No need to be so uptight, Gr G36. This is one of my regular haunts, and this bartender is a good friend of mine.
Alma(2);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:No, I am sorry, I am simply...having trouble coping.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:What's wrong? Do you think there's a problem with your neural cloud?
Alma(2);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I cannot say why either. Something just feels wrong.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:I felt the same way when I went outside too... Gr G36, have your reflexes grown slower?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Alma, is your debugging really "legal"?
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Of course, other than a few small...er... +I'm sure everyone must have taken apart a computer or keyboard before, purely out of curiosity to see how it was made... +And then maybe you discovered that there were one or two keys you couldn't put back...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No, my nanny would never have allowed it, and I was never that interested in that sort of thing. All it has to do is work.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Aren't you the slightest bit curious about riddles, Jill!?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Not curious enough to break other's things, which is why I'm not the one in trouble.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:I'm certain that I didn't do anything too far out of the ordinary. Perhaps there was a bug when I was working on the neural cloud, or some stray debris got in... +Let me see your eyes, Gr G36... +Right, I'll note this down. Hang on a bit, I need to go out back to make a call.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Don't take too long, I still need to go outside for a smoke afterward. +...She's gone. +I'm sorry, Miss Gr G36, you know Alma's a good person, just that she's more curious than most.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:It is alright. It is true that Miss Alma did not do anything wrong. +It is just...I do not know where the problem lies.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Of course you do not know where the problem is. +That is because you are not even yourself.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:You are...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Good evening, Jill Stingray. +I apologize for causing you unnecessary trouble this evening. I am Gr G36; the real Gr G36.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What? No, I'm the real Gr G36. You are not.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Wait, wait a minute... +Why is there a maid Gr G36 here along with a butler Gr G36... Granted, both of you look like you have the same face...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Miss Jill, please do not panic. I hope you will allow me to explain the matter in detail. +However, may I first sample a Suplex from your establishment?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:A Suplex?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:I apologize, my request was too sudden.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No, it's completely fine, I've already served drinks to many Dolls already. A moment please.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Let's give the butler Gr G36 that suddenly appeared out of nowhere a Suplex... Wow, can she really handle such a stiff drink?)+<va11><perfect>23<good>7,15,19
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Here, Miss Other-Gr G36. This drink is very spicy, mind, so please take your time.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I am prepared for this.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I changed the taste, what do you think of it?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Mm, I know what this is, it is fine.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:You really have studied your drinks. Perhaps we could talk for a long time.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:I thank you for your care and effort in making this drink. Please allow me to sample it.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(She... emptied the glass in one mouthful!) + (And then she lowered her head, like a shoebill.)
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:...Perfect. It will definitely be popular. +Thank you for serving me, Miss Jill. I will take its recipe back to Griffin.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I'm honored. So, what were you going to explain, Gr G36...er, or should I just call you Miss Butler instead?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:By all means. I will now take up some of your time to explain the situation. +Gr G36, could you have consumed this drink just now?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Me? ...I...I do not think so.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:As you can see, Miss Jill, the real Gr G36 ought to be able to hold her liquor well. +This maid Doll before you might be dressed in Gr G36's commonly-worn clothing, but in truth... +She is nothing more than a vacuum cleaner.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Wait, a vacuum cleaner!?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Yes. An hour ago, before Miss Alma brought me outside, she accidentally knocked over a vacuum cleaner. +After that, I went to help her up. +I imagine that due to some bizarre effect of her prosthetic arm which was filled with electronic synapses, it caused my mind and that of the vacuum cleaner to be switched.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, you're saying... +That this maid here...is actually a vacuum cleaner? +I know vacuum cleaners have been allowed to possess wills of their own, but suddenly transferring one into the body of a Doll...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But I...don't remember at all...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:That is because your mind might have been transferred to a Doll's body, but your memories were not brought along with them. +When my mind was removed from my original body, my neural cloud automatically recognized the other soul within my body as the consciousness of the main body. +Miss Vacuum Cleaner, it is the neural cloud that made you think you are Gr G36. Your memories and personality actually belong to me.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I...I am...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(What a wonderful night this is turning out to be, I'm actually listening to an android and a vacuum cleaner discuss their souls.) +Then what about you, Miss Butler? If you're the real Gr G36, then how did you escape the vacuum cleaner?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:I activated an emergency escape program and transferred myself into this backup body. +After that, I followed that maid body's signals here.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I...I don't believe this... I'm a vacuum cleaner... +My memories of Griffin...and everyone...they're all...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:This is the most direct way to prove whether or not you are Gr G36's main body. +A Doll's mainframe and dummies can share memories, but as an external entity, you cannot form a complete match with the neural cloud, so your authorization to access my memories will be restricted. +Think about it, do you remember forming an oath with the Commander?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I...I don't remember...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Then where did that ring on your hand come from?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...!
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Wow... the plot suddenly took a nose-dive.)
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:No...it can't be... I... +I'm sorry, Miss Gr G36...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Do not be afraid, Miss Vacuum Cleaner, I will not do anything to you. +I simply wish to reclaim my main body and continue serving Griffin. We will discuss the matter with Miss Alma and find a sufficiently gentle solution to this problem.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I... It's true that I can't think of any other way, we should just...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:(Maybe she might retain Gr G36's memories while being a vacuum cleaner... That doesn't sound too pleasant either.)
G36little(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:H-Hey! Wait a minute!
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Dammit, don't tell me...)
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Good evening, Miss Jill, Miss Vacuum Cleaner and...Miss Toaster.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Good evening...wait, what did you just call her?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Toaster? What are you talking about!?
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Uuu...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:You've scared the poor girl, Miss Butler. +(Although what she said scared us too.)
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Uuu...ah...may I have a Fluffy Dream?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Ah? Oh...alright...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Let's give this little Doll a Fluffy Dream, and maybe she'll be able to explain what on Earth is going on.) +<va11><perfect>9
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Thank you very much, Miss Jill!
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Er...I suddenly realized something. If you're a child model, are Dolls allowed to drink?
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:While my personality has turned childlike due to my body, my memories came from that adult body. +If my memories are from my adulthood, then am I still a child?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:This...er... +Forget it, I don't care anymore. Besides, Griffin Dolls don't have IDs.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:I apologize for startling you with that shameful display just now, little girl. +But did you say I was a toaster? Where is the basis for that? I clearly have a complete set of memories.
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:The confusion of Miss Alma's fall...did not just involve the vacuum cleaner. +If your memories are complete, then why do you not remember that I wanted the recipe for the Fluffy Dream drink?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:My memories state that I wanted to make the Suplex, and not the Fluffy Dream.
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:I originally wanted to make the Suplex, but in the end I decided on a milder drink for the upcoming cocktail party. +Miss Toaster, all you inherited were my deleted...and accidentally misplaced memories.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:But...my memories of the oath...
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Then...do you remember where the signs of damage on the ring came from?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Damage? I do not remember it ever being damaged...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:The ring was definitely broken, of that I can be sure... It was damaged in combat.
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:That section of memories regarding the oath was not backed up in time, and it was damaged in the battle that followed.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:I....was totally unaware... Why...
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:I had never been able to recover that stretch of memory... +Miss Toaster...thank you for finding them for me...
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(Well...this is embarrassing.) +Ladies, perhaps you should wait for Alma to come in again before having a good chat about this. This isn't a problem that you can't solve, right?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Actually...being a maid is very tiring. Maybe it would be good to go back to being a vacuum cleaner.
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:At the very least, I feel...that I can do more than toasting bread...
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Hm...ladies, let us discuss this... +If you do not wish to be household appliances, then would you like to be Dinergates?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What?
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:You mean, the Dinergates on sale in the supermarket?
G36little(0)<Speaker>Gr G36??</Speaker>||:Dinergates have many functions. Let's go take a look at them, I'm sure there'll be a model you'll like! +Miss Jill, please tell Miss Alma that we will be waiting for her at the supermarket!
G36bar(0)<Speaker>Gr G36?</Speaker>||:Thank you for entertaining us tonight. Though I am but a toaster, I enjoyed an exceptional evening.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Me too, Miss Jill... At the very least, I finally realized that Miss Alma's room was messy because the vacuum cleaner was too old.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:You'll all have a chance to be reborn. Good night, all three of you. +... +If A's mind possesses B's memories, then would they be A or B? How bizarre.
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:Ahh...it's finally settled. +They agreed to send someone over to my side to check things out, and now I'll be able to learn more stuff. +That Griffin lot is so crafty, especially that Kalina, her attitude before and after the sale was completely different... +...Wait a minute, where did my maid go?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:She went shopping with your vacuum cleaner and your toaster. +They just stepped out, so you should still be able to catch up to them.
Alma(3)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:That's quite a lame joke... +Wait a minute...you don't look like you're kidding, how many beers did you drink tonight? Or are you telling me...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right. This city has always been a mess, hasn't it? +Also... +You don't mind picking up the tab for your household appliances, do you?
