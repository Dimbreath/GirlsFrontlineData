？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>186</BIN><BGM>m_va_where_do_i_go_from_here_</BGM>:Enjoy the present day and the present time... +Welcome to Valhalla... +Miss Jill.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Ugh... +What...
M1903bar(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Good evening, Miss Jill.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;M1903bar(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:Who are you...
Jill(2);M1903bar(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:My name is Springfield, Valhalla's bartender. +Have you decided on your order, Miss Jill?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;M1903bar(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:Er... +This doesn't seem right...
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Sorry, I'm late!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hi! We meet again, Jill!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Who are you... +Should I know you?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I'm Architect, from Sangvis Ferri Manufacture! +The other you might know me, because when the other Anna gave me my mission, I saw you and Gillian at the bar. +Of course, that's not the Gillian you know, but Gr G28, the big-breasted Doll you met while you were still awake.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:What are you talking about? Where is this place?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Jill, do you remember how you got here?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I don't remember... How did I...
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Of course you don't remember! +Because this place doesn't exist!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:What?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hi! Springfield, do you have carrots now?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:We don't have carrots at the moment.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Alright, then I'll take a Mercuryblast!
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:One Mercuryblast, coming up.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Miss Criminal here wants a Mercuryblast.) +<va11><perfect>15
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Here, a Mercuryblast.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hah! It's no carrot, but it's still good for you!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:This drink doesn't look healthy at all.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:If you don't like it, then it's good for you! +Do you like being healthy?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I...like being healthy, I guess?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:No, you don't. +You like being the way you are now, Jill. You like being morbidly stagnant!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:...Looking back at my life, I can't say you're entirely wrong.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Then have you considered this question, Jill? +There are many possibilities in this world, and both your life and this world's fate could have been something different!
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:And I have been to another world, Jill. +I even met the other you, and many other people.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:What?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:That world's about to be destroyed, or rather, it's fated to be destroyed, but you looked much livelier than you are now.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I can't imagine... +But whatever, if there is such a me in that other world, then she and I would be two entirely unrelated individuals. +She'd just be like someone I met on the street. I'd only get jealous if I met her.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:True, you're related to some extent, but you're fundamentally two different people. +Have you ever thought of living someone else's life? If you knew she is happier than you are, would you want to replace her?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I don't think I would do that. +Leaving aside the legal issues it would bring, I shouldn't replace someone else, because that's their life...
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Then let's change the conditions. +If I could let you take your present memories and travel back over a stretch of time, to say, around several years earlier, would you be willing to do it?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Sign me up right now, dammit!
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, that was just a question, and not an invitation. +So why can you accept replacing yourself from the past, but not replacing yourself in another world?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Like you said, I'm not that person, so I shouldn't interfere with their life. They're completely different things.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Give me a break, Jill. What do you think our relationships are? They're just mutual interference.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:But it doesn't mean that I'd be able to adapt to their life. +What if their happiness isn't the kind that I want? Perhaps I would personally break the vase? +I don't deserve things like that. My own life is a mess. All I want to do is fix it, not start over again.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:You see, it's just like what I said, isn't it, Architect?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hah, this doesn't mean the other Jill would choose the same way too.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Admit it, this is who Jill is. +You should hurry up and get a move on while there's still time.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:What exactly are you guys talking about? You've been leaving me out of the loop. Someone needs to explain what's going on to me!
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I can't explain the things you want me to be honest with you about right now, Jill. +Not only would you not understand what I'm saying, but your memories will vanish the moment you leave this place.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:What?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I only came here to verify one thing, Jill; no matter how happy the other person's life is, you wouldn't want to replace her, right?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I've already turned my life into a pile of shit... I don't want to do that to anyone else's.
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I will keep that in mind. Springfield, I'm going over to the other side for a chat. I'll leave the rest to you.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm counting on you, Architect. Don't mess it up... +You do know the consequences, right?
Jill(2);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I told you already, I have no ill intentions! Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. +Jill, you'll only be able to see me in an answering machine next time.+Good luck, and I hope the other Jill thinks the same way as you do too.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What... +She's gone.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:She's in a hurry. There isn't much time left for that world.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So...I'm stuck in my own bar while a Doll dressed entirely in black talks to me about parallel worlds. +And another Doll in my uniform is standing in my place doing my job, as though she is taunting me.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But I'm not taunting you.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Then your chest is taunting me... +I'm sorry, this place is making me a little irritable... Can I go outside for a smoke?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If you open the door, you will find that there is nothing outside, Jill. You can't go anywhere now, until I give you the permission.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Then give me a Sparkle Star. +Since you're sitting in my seat, you should know what to do, right?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I've never made that before, but I can give it a try.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:(Miss Jill over here wants a Sparkle Star.)+<va11><perfect>20<good>5,6,16,18,21
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Hmm...not bad. Maybe you could skip the BTC training and go straight to work.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Thank you for your compliment. I simply made it according to my internal modules.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Wow, looks like you've got a rebellious side to you, Miss Springfield.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:We only have a short time together. I hope you will quickly understand my strengths.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So...you're really not going to tell me anything?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If you really want to know, I can give you the key points. +Although, you might forget all about this after you wake up, because in theory, there will be no traces of the neural contact here.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Why is that?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That is because everything that happens here has nothing to do with your brain and senses. +In fact, your mind has been drawn outside your body by nanotechnology from another world, into...a deeper layer of electronic space.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Y-You're saying...I'm having an out-of-body-experience!?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There's a more scientific explanation, but from a human perspective, that can be considered to be the case.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Then what were you talking about when you mentioned...replacing somebody else?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Jill, are you familiar with brain upload technology?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Some time ago, I was discussing this very topic with a very special customer.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:If uploading the brain were possible, then what about the technology for downloading a brain?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...+I think I understand. +Alright, we're in the 2070s, and since I've taken care of a pack of talking dogs before, then downloading a brain to overwrite memories isn't that strange. +So what does this have to do with me? Why did you bring me here?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Jill, you got a Doll drunk several days ago. Do you remember that?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I'm very sorry about that. Are you here because of that incident?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, but it's probably not for the reasons you're thinking. +Under the double influence of her intoxication and nanomachines, that Doll accidentally picked up some..."detritus". +Ah, I apologize. "Detritus" is the phrasing Architect used when making her report. +In truth, it was your friend, Anna Graem.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What... +Ugh...maybe it's because things are happening too suddenly, but what bothers me now is the fact that you're actually treating her as a friend of mine.
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:This is the report Architect made after reading Anna's memories.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll concede...
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Anna's mind and that of the drunk Doll merged to form a new electronic space. +Through autonomous processing, this electronic space developed a brand new world and civilization.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I...I don't know what to say... +Then where's Anna? Is she in danger?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Miss Jill. +According to Architect's report, Anna is now leaving this world as the host Doll gradually regains consciousness.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Thank goodness... So, is that Architect your investigator?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:She is actually a criminal that we are keeping watch over. +Prior to this incident, she was transported into the host Doll's neural cloud with the technical assistance of her friend Ouroboros. +When we sent a Doll to pursue her through electronic warfare, we found this marvelous digital world. +However, given her deep understanding of this world and her willingness to cooperate with us, we chose to work with her with the aim of saving this world instead.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Saving...the world?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Miss Jill, if this world were nothing more than a dream, then what would happen when you wake up?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I...I understand. +Then...how are you going to save the world?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That would depend on what you choose, Miss Jill. +I am simply observing the entire process as ordered by my Commander.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What I choose? What does this have to do with me... +Wait... +You just said...replace...download...
()||:...Ding ding ding!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What's that noise?
春田()<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Ah...it's Cinderella time. My shift is over.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Huh...? +Wait a minute, Springfield, your clothes.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点2>:Hm, this outfit really does suit me better. +Before I go, could you make me a Sunshine Cloud, Miss Jill?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What... +... +When did I get behind the bar...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Please, Miss Jill.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I...I understand...
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:(A Sunshine Cloud, now that sounds like something this Doll would order...)+<va11><perfect>22<good>12,13,19,23
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<分支>1</分支>:I expected nothing less of a drink that only Jill Stingray could make.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Save it, anyone with BTC training could do it. In fact, they don't even need the training.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<分支>2</分支>:You made something else, but...it's still good.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I was sure you'd like the taste. It's one of a bartender's duties.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:One last question, Miss Jill. +Could you accept something that is fake?
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:The drink I gave you contains many substitutes for real ingredients, and even the alcohol is fake. +But the drunkenness it gives you is real, and the out-of-control emotions that result from that drunkenness are also real...so something fake can also elicit true feelings. +Therefore, if it is something that can affect my true emotions, then I don't care if it's real or fake.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:My Commander once said... +While we are androids made by humans with personalities and preferences created beforehand....+There must have been someone's true expectations embedded within them somewhere, so we should not doubt the value of our existence... +Thank you, Miss Jill...thank you for making us.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I simply said what I and a lot of humans think. +We should be the ones thanking you. Thank you for coming to this world, so we don't have to keep facing this bare, dogshit of a reality.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I am honored to do so. That is the meaning of our existence. +I will leave everything after this to you, Miss Jill.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:After this? What's happening after this? Don't you have any suggestions?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:...+I'm sorry, I really don't know. +When we next meet, you can tell me, and in return, I will serve you coffee. +Goodnight then, Miss Jill.
吉尔()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Goodnight. I hope I'll see you again.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'm sure you will.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...+ And she's gone... +Alright... +Let me think... What the hell happened tonight... +A Doll from Griffin got drunk and then the entire bar and the entire world got thrown into chaos... +And I'm still stuck in this godforsaken place... +Who else is going to come next? Well, no matter who it is, it can't possibly be any more confusing than what I've encountered tonight. +Dammit...this is worse than the time I had to entertain those dogs...
