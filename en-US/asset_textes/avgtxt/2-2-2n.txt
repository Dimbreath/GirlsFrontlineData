M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Ingram, I'm leaving this place to you. Prepare for your stationing.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Huh? Me?+Seriously... How long do I have to stay here?
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Probably quite a while. The military is still deploying their T-Dolls. They didn't say when the action will take place.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:So why did we have to involve the military? We can handle those stupid tin men on our own just fine.
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We're a business. We should always avoid splurging ourselves if we can spend someone else's money.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:(Sighs) I'm not here to make money. What I want is a bloodbath, Thompson.+I only joined your team after hearing about you.
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Then you're gonna be sorely disappointed. All my actions were taken under Griffin's instruction, never on a reckless whim.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Then what about the unspeakable things you did under the table?
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:They were all within permissible range... Here, take this.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:What... A detonator?
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:This is your job. Once you get it over with, I don't care if you go batshit crazy.
MAC10(0)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Humph. So you're not as dull as you claim to be.
MAC10(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Make an effort, Ingram. Be glad it's Griffin you're working for.+Party to your heart's content - within permissible range of our contract.
