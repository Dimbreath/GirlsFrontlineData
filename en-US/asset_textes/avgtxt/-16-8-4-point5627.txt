AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:AK-12, you haven't forgotten your own specialty, have you?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Which one are you referring to?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We'll need to deal with those military units if we want to pass through here. The best way is to assume direct control over them.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's possible, given the present circumstances. But I'll need some help for this. +See those radar stations there? I need you to capture them so I can hack into the military units.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Those radar stations, huh...Got it, I'll inform M4A1.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Also, I can't tell exactly which military units I'll be able to reach from any particular radar station. It's all a matter of luck.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Beggars can't be choosers. Leave the radar stations to us. You take care of the rest.
