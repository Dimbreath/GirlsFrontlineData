System Broadcast()<Speaker>System Broadcast</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏1>：Routine inspections over. Tactical Dolls M4A1,+M16A1,+M4 SOPMOD II+Please return to your quarters.
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2>：Phew...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Everyone on the AR Team, this way please.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Gosh... It's finally over...+It's the same every single day. When is it gonna end?!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：16LAB is still working on a way to counter Parapluie.+They'll probably turn us loose once they've got some result...
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Tsk.. Persica'd better hurry.+I can't take this much longer...+AR-15 is gone... But Sangvis Ferri is still doing whatever the hell they please...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：...+SOP-II, we WILL have vengeance.+Helian promised she'd assign us an operation once we're outta here.+We'll keep on fulfilling the purpose of the AR Team and turn Sangvis Ferri inside-out till we get to the bottom of Mastermind's identity.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Yeah? Then I can't wait to get started...+We might as well go straight for this Mastermind!+Arghhhh let me out! I wanna tear her to pieces! Pull out all her teeth! And hack off her head!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Shut it!+Can you just keep quiet?!
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：M4...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：(Softly) ...Sorry.
()||：...M4 walks ahead alone.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Just pipe down a little, SOP-II.+M4 is taking it the hardest...+And you know how hard she tried to put on a happy face in the recording for the commander yesterday.+After all...she feels the most guilty for what happened...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Um... Miss M4, dinner is ready.+Would you like to dine in the cafeteria or should I bring it to your quarters?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：...+Cinnamon rolls again?
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Apologies. Ingredients are limited at the detention center. Cinnamon rolls and sandwiches are all I can make.+I'm working hard on improving the recipes and will try to dish out something new tomorrow.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Uh... So it'll still be bread...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Deepest apologies. Due to security concerns, HQ has restricted the resources coming in and out of the detention center...
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Nah it's fine. You're already trying your best to jazz it up even if it's just cinnamon rolls.+M4, let's go to the cafeteria. We gotta talk to Helian later anyway.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Oh yeah! And she'll play us a recording from the commander, right?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...+I am not in the mood. Go on your own.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Miss M4, you should still take your meal. HQ has given...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：...HQ has given specific orders for me to eat, you mean?
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：So no matter what it is, as long as it is an order from Griffin, I have to do it, yes?!
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Miss M4, please calm down...
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Who are they to lock me up in here?!+We are T-Dolls produced by 16LAB! We are only loaned to Griffin!+Dammit!
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：(Whimpers)
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Hey, M4! Don't take it out on her!+m45 is only a supervisor here. I know you're pissed but don't use her as a punching bag!
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Hey, what's going on in here?+What's all this fuss about?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Ah, Miss Negev...+M4 isn't in a good mood. Did we disturb you?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Humph... Nah it's fine...+But seriously, what's the deal with your leader? I haven't even said a word all the while I've been here...
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：There's no helping it. The AR Team's neural framework is a bit different from that of IOP T-Dolls.+The emotional fluctuations can be more volatile...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Humph. You're also 16LAB's lab rats, but I don't see you two sulking.+At least try to LOOK like a leader. She's not the only one in a bad mood.+Just think about me. I only went in there to rescue you guys, but ended up being locked up and scrutinized in here too...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：...I did not ask you to rescue us.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：M4!
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Ha! Sorry, dear! No matter how outstandingly capable I am, in the end I'm only a lowly T-Doll fabricated by IOP.+Put it simply: I can only act on autonomous stratagems laid down by a commander.+(Stands up) Otherwise, a loser like you isn't worth...
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Um... Everyone please calm down...+It's almost time for Miss Helian's call. If she sees this...
()||<黑屏2>：...Click.
m45(0)<Speaker>m45</Speaker>||：Oh, that must be Miss Helian.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：...She seems to be earlier than usual.

M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Quick, M4! Command us to counterattack!
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：What? Me?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：Still not catching on, M4?!+Hurry up and organize a counterattack, or we'll all die here!
M16(3);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：But...+Asking me to command so many T-Dolls all of a sudden... Not to mention most of them are unfamiliar faces...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||：That's precisely why we need you, M4!+There are no commanders here. You are the only one with the same level of commanding efficiency in the whole of Griffin.+That's why, M4, you are our only hope...
