M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ouroboros...
WeaverElite(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>;M4A1(0)||:Ah...that's the face... +You do know you won't be the next to die, right...? +You're gonna be the last.
WeaverElite(0);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You mean... +You know where I am?
WeaverElite(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:Oh... +Now I remember. That's something even you yourself don't know.
WeaverElite(0);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you the ones...who are holding me captive here?
WeaverElite(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||<黑屏1>:Holding you captive? +Hahahahahaha! +Poor dear, looks like you're completely clueless!
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:You have no idea what kind of sacrifices your friends have made for you...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...! +What...what do you mean?!
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:They put all their hopes of survival on an unconscious M4A1 at the very last moment...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏2>:They shoved you into a control room with a camouflaged signal then faced me valiantly... +And you know how that ended for them, of course...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +(No...that can't be true...)
WeaverElite(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||:Do you miss them? M16A1 and M4 SOPMODII? +I can recover the video recording of their final moments for you... +The moment they charged to their deaths...and the dismal state they were in afterward... +HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4! Are you okay?! +Your functional parameters...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...I'm fine... +Just a little...disturbed... +Don't worry. Until I help you escape, I won't...
WeaverElite(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hahahahaha! Why must you help them escape, M4A1? +They're the ones keeping you there!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'm sorry, M4A1. We do know... +The passcode to the door of your control room... +And we're the only ones who know...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +(Sighs) You really picked a splendid time to tell me...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:M4A1, that's because...
WeaverElite(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Alright, ladies, that's enough revelations for the plot. +Now...it's time to decide which ending we're heading towards.
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:M4A1, you initially had the chance to escape the battlefield on your own. +Unfortunately, you wasted your precious time on these scraps of junk, so you've already lost your opportunity. +Tell me, do you hate them? Do you regret helping them?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +Why would I hate them? +Isn't it a commander's duty to fight till their last breath for victory? +I can finally serve with pride and honor...just like the Commander...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:M4A1...
衔尾蛇()<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Humph...a slightly unexpected answer, but still a reasonable one. +You're much more spineless than I thought. Then are you prepared to be yanked out along with your useless friends? +After all, your numbers are pretty much depleted. Killing the rest is just a matter of time...
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Which means we can do it as long as we have time, right? +Guys, attack!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑屏1>:...!
WeaverElite(2)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>3</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:An ambush! How is this possible?! +You! How...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:Vikhr!
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker><通讯框>||:Heheh, don't underestimate the resilience of an elite T-Doll. +It took quite some time to get out of that pinch, but I did find a lot of friends who survived as well! +M4A1, didn't think you'd last this long. Did we make it?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:You're right on time. Welcome back. +Now the tables can be turned!
WeaverElite(2)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||:Impossible! Don't forget your objective! +I'll destroy you all right here! Not a single one of you will make it out!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Right... Of course you'd do that. +But...only if you can find us.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:M99, Vikhr, this is our last chance. +We must...get out of here!
()||<BIN>10</BIN>:...
WeaverElite(4)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>||:Here's a reminder: all the Sangvis Dolls you have encountered so far...were dummies that I set up. +They have neither sentience nor consciousness, and naturally...require no complex reconstruction. +So come, be my guest...and torment these pitiful creatures to your heart's content!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4A1, Ouroboros has reanimated the dummies of Hunter, Executioner and Architect. +Their stats may not be higher than their previous versions, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous. Please take care.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Understood. I have started formulating an infiltration plan.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:By the way, M4A1, this is the passcode to the door of the control room. +Actually...we didn't tell you before because M16A1 asked us not to... +She thought this control room was your only protection. +She was afraid that you'd be in danger if you left.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Yeah...that's just like her... +That's what she's always been doing... +She was trying to substitute herself with the control room...to protect me...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:But she forgot...that no one could ever replace her... +And some day, I'll have to survive on my own...
