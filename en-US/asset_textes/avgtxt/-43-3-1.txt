K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Personally, I don't care. Luck is the sort of thing that shuns you the more you want it.

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:If we managed to steal their items, I'm pretty sure we would have much less difficulty in the Dark Zone.+However, if we just shoot them while they're unawares, some other Dolls might show up to pick up the spoils, so we're better off launching a surprise attack.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Good idea. I'll let you and 9 handle it.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Leave it to me, 45!

HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's the matter, don't tell me you're going to take command and have me fight them?
