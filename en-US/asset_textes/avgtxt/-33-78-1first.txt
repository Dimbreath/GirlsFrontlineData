()||:【The destination can now be observed with the naked eye. There are still things you haven't told me.】
()||:【Why would I withhold information from you?】
()||:【You clearly know something about the white faction that has been impeding our efforts, yet you never offered any explanation.】
()||:【Well, you never asked.】
()||:【I'm asking now, aren't I?】
()||:【The first time I came across Paradeus was when I was working in Southern Europe. Back then, they were merely considered a cult. Nobody gave them a second thought - this was back in a time when cults were extremely common.】+【However, after several nasty incidents concerning this organization, people finally started noticing them.】+【An investigation revealed that both their rate of expansion and their armament were completely out of the ordinary. Rather than a cult, they are more like a terrorist organization with a political agenda.】
()||:【Terrorists that harvest dead bodies... I'm surprised anyone would agree with and even join their cause.】
()||:【Don't underestimate the desperation of refugees. There's a market for this kind of cheap salvation.】
()||:【People who commit evil just to live a few days longer do not deserve sympathy. I'm more concerned about the rate at which the white faction's armament is growing. More advanced units show up every time we fight them.】
()||:【"It's as if they're testing their weaponry on us." Is that what you're thinking?】
()||:【What is driving them to expand their armament so quickly?】
()||<黑屏1>:【That's what we're here to find out.】

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's all the recordings we received this time, Commander. +Hmm...these voices all sound quite familiar, and judging from the subjects they touched on, these conversations shouldn't have taken place too long ago. +Hopefully all this new intelligence will prove useful for our operation.
