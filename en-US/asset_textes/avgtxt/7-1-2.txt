()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>：Today's patrol completed.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||：That wraps up today's operation. Thanks for the hard work!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||：According to your report, Commander, some Sangvis units have appeared on the border of Area S05.+I'm filing it to Miss Helian just to be safe.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||：Oh? You wanna see Miss Helian, too?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：...+Ah... Still wanna fight for that?+After all...that's what you're here for.
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>8</BIN>：...+Ten minutes later. Secured a call with Helian.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>：Commander, I have read the report you just uploaded.+Your vigilance is commendable, but further directives will have to wait till the conference at HQ is over.+Is there anything else?+...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>：Helian switches the communication channel.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：...I'm sorry, Commander, but it's impossible to grant this particular request.+You may not see the AR Team at the moment.+It's nothing personal, nor is it about the outcome of the last operation.+Apart from me and the supervising T-Doll within the detention center, nobody is currently authorized to interact with members of the AR Team.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>36</BIN>：As you know, that incident cost us the entire Area S08, and we suffered severe economic loss because of that.+We tried our best to keep word from getting out, but with all the slanders from our competitors, Griffin's reputation has still taken quite a blow, which is also a heavy, if intangible, loss to us.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>27</BIN>：And all this happened because AR-15 was infected by the Parapluie virus.+Sorry, I'm not pushing the blame onto a single T-Doll. We are also deeply sorry for what happened to AR-15...+But in order to prevent the tragedy from repeating itself, we must treat all personnel who have been in contact with Parapluie with extreme caution from now on, even if it means going to extremes.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>17</BIN>：Which is why the AR Team must undergo mandatory detention until it is confirmed that none of them shows any traces of having been implanted with Parapluie.+During the observation period, their personal freedom is limited. They cannot leave the detention center, nor can they have any contact with the outside world.+But rest assured, I will ensure that their daily life is well taken care of, as befits the treatment of elite T-Dolls, and that they will not be mistreated in any way.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>：...Still not convinced?+Commander, I know you are deeply concerned about their current situation. We understand your sentiment.+Which is why we accepted your application and permitted you to transfer your work to Area S05...+...The very area in which the detention center currently housing the AR Team is located.+But any further contact with them is not in line with HQ's arrangement. I hope you'll understand...
