Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:S.F. Dolls...they're average. +Military automatons...they're so ugly they make me sick. +Now, these White Faction infiltrator Dolls...they look the best. +But why is it that these White Faction Dolls are the most troublesome ones to handle?!
Lewis(0);P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:There's no end to the missions we're running outside, I can't believe you've still got the strength to complain so much.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;P22(0)||:I can't help it, I feel bad about opening fire on targets that move my heart! +First it was the high-end S.F. Dolls, and now these...
Lewis(0);P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:What are you so sad about? Either those beautiful targets get disfigured, or you do. Feel free to take your pick. +If you want to blame someone, then blame mankind for making such pretty things do jobs like this.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;P22(0)||:Humans or Dolls, why won't they just sit down and talk things out... +A lot of things wouldn't have to be so complicated if only people had more patience!
Lewis(0);P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:They wouldn't? +Do you think your enemies are also that naive?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But—
X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:Ladies, are you really not going to use this time to get some rest? +We'll be very busy over the next few days.
P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:I just can't help it, X95. +Her Grace over here doesn't know how the world works yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...P22 stretches her body from where she's sitting on the sofa.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Humph! I just don't get it! +Besides, I don't understand why people still love to fight even though everyone knows that bloody conflicts are bad! +And fighting would be one thing, but ruining such pretty faces—
X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:Ugh... +Lewis, very often people don't choose to fight because they want to, but because they have to. +Would you be so opposed to a war if it could compel two enemies to sit down and talk out their differences?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But there'll be lots of unhappiness as long as there's war. +It shouldn't be worthwhile!
P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Isn't that why humans use Dolls to bleed on their behalf? +From that point of view, you ought to be glad that you're a Doll, Your Worship.
X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:You don't need to put it that way, Miss P22...
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But they're just making us handle all the things they don't want to face! +The source of the problem hasn't been dealt with at all.
Lewis(0);X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:Many things are like that. Perhaps these problems may never be resolved. +Humans passed those things on to us because very often, they, too, had to bear a lot of problems which didn't belong to them...
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;X95(0)||:Since it's not their problem, they should just ignore it...
Lewis(0);X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:The problems left over from the past can't be abandoned so easily. That's the price of human progress. +Too many people have had to bear the hatred of others from birth, even if both parties will never, ever meet. +And blind hatred...eventually results in war.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But how can everyone be so blind?! +Surely any of their leaders...no, any one of them with some sense would know this is completely illogical, right? +So why don't they choose to stop it?
P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Hehe, it's not just that they didn't stop it, but the smartest humans even gave it a grand-sounding title. +People nowadays are more inclined to call these leftover problems from the past "nationalism".
X95(0)<Speaker>X95</Speaker>||:I think the most ironic thing is that in the end, the only thing that can calm these people down is war. +..."It is well that war is so terrible, or we should grow too fond of it."
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:... +(Sighs) Why isn't there a button that can wipe away all hatred with a push... +Then we wouldn't need to keep going round in circles...
Lewis(0);P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:It's hard to say if everyone wants such a thing. +Would you be willing to reach an understanding with S.F. Dolls?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;P22(0)||:I don't have any basis for this, but I feel that the high-end S.F. Dolls aren't bad people. +There must have been some misunderstanding which led to them becoming the way they are now.
Lewis(0);P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||:Even if you think it's possible, how many of us would be able to accept that point of view? +These are the same S.F. Dolls that have been wrecking our comrades out there, you know.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;P22(0)||:How can I answer that?! +I'm just a Doll, if S.F. destroys me, then just send me back to IOP for repairs. +Ugh...my head hurts... +Why do we have to discuss this...
P22(0)<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's why I think we should just be good Dolls and not think too much. Leave the complicated questions for the big shots to worry about.  +Besides...we're just tools that mankind use to achieve their goals.
()<Speaker>P22</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Just like how they gain the most benefit for themselves by ravaging this world...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN>:...Upstairs in the safe house.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Seems like the people downstairs have piped down at last... +Why do they need to talk about things that have nothing to do with them the moment they get inside... +Isn't it much more comfy to just lie down and watch TV?
HS2000(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:When a soul is beset by confusion and doubt, it is only natural that it becomes aggressive. +Suspicion is simply a way to express an attack.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:I don't quite get it... +Still, their discussion was drowning out the sound of the program. I can finally watch TV in peace now. +But the programs here are more boring than I imagined... I thought Griffin's video archives were outdated enough, but I didn't expect that there would be a place that's even worse.
HS2000(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Be content with the fact that you've got something to watch... You're lucky that you weren't picked for electronic warfare duties or whatever, where your brain can get burned up if you're even the slightest bit careless.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:We don't have brains... Those are neural clouds, dear, neural clouds...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"We interrupt this program to bring you an urgent weather report..."
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:And now I can't even watch TV...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:"A thunderstorm will strike Belgrade within the next 48 hours. The purification towers are at Level Four alert and the trains on the Intercontinental Railway in or out of the city have been cancelled." +"Due to the recent surge in Collapse Fluid levels, the storm may bring intense radiation contamination. Citizens must cease all outdoor activities for the next two days." +"If an emergency situation arises, please contact the following departments—"
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:What does this warning mean... +Is this something we should care about? Are we going to have a vacation?
HS2000(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Given the content, it seems to be aimed at the local population. In other words...only the humans. +I don't think this will affect us in carrying out our mission. +We're made of materials that are highly resistant to radiation. That was why we were chosen to come here.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Which means we still need to go outside and find the White Faction Dolls, then... +Ugh... I don't want to go outdoors in hazardous weather...
HS2000(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:The challenges which take you out of your comfort zone will eventually become your weapons.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:But I don't wanna leave my comfort zone... +Ehhhh... I hate this... Can't I get a weaker body, the kind with which I can get paid just for being cute...?
HS2000(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Destiny will not take pity on your weakness. +Your wish will only lead to you being wrecked in battle.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ehhhh, you're so cold...+Still, even if I get wrecked, I can still be fixed. I don't have to die outside even in crappy weather like this. Suddenly, being a Doll doesn't seem so bad after all.
