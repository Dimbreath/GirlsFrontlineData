NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, our freighters have completed the cannon extraction.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Fantastic. Serendipity never fails to cheer me up.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) Perhaps this has something to do with your previous job?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:I don't deny that. +Besides, not many contractors can get their hands on the Military's technology.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:By the way, the Commander is still on the frontline. Should we give the order to withdraw?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Not yet. +If the Commander's team is still holding up, keep the operation going. +Reward them according to their performance in battle after the withdrawal.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Are you...testing the Commander's limit?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Not testing. Exploring. +We'll need that knowledge one day. +Regarding Squad 404, Have the neural clouds of all witnesses been wiped?
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes. However, there is still some leftover memory in M16A1...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:I know. Things from before the creation of 404 don't matter. +Give them a holiday. They need it. +Perhaps we need one, too.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:When the Commander returns, perhaps we should organize a banquet... +Something...warm. +To celebrate spring, festivities, victory, and all things bright and beautiful... +To give thanks to the Commander as well as the T-Dolls. They have all worked hard.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:No problem. You're in charge.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Play your part too, Mr. Kryuger. Try to come up with a speech that isn't so rigid.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:That's gonna be tough. +I'm not sure if I can finish it before the Commander makes it back.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Don't worry. The Commander is going to last very long. +How about a bet? On who's the first to finish their job?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Well, let's wait and see...
