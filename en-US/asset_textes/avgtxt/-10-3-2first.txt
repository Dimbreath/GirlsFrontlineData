Don't go giving us T-Dolls this useless even though it's just for training. +Stop complaining and try a weapon that's less demanding on the T-Doll. +Alright. Matching another firearm... +Insufficient storage. Unable to install fire control system and gyro adjustment software. +Then pick something that requires less storage space and only install the basic software. +Is this a signal-analoging Doll? The internal system itself takes up so much space even in her initial state. +I think it's a model designed for electronic warfare in cyber network. Unfortunately, there's practically no cyber network left in this apocalyptic world, so this child...is destined to be useless. +Basic combat functions installed. As for her weapon...a couple of submachine guns seem to fit the bill. +Pick one of them and load it onto the Imprint system. +Okay, matching complete. But seriously, Griffin won't have any use for this kind of T-Doll, right? +The higher-ups know what they're doing. We just have to follow orders. +Cyber network T-Doll, eh? Ironic, isn't it? I do hope she'll survive a bit longer. +You'd still wanna have her die for you if it ever came to that. After all, T-Dolls exist to protect humanity. +Haha, you have a point.
