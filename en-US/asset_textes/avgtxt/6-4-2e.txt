()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:Three hours since the start of the retreat...+...+......
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Good evening...+...Finally, we meet.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:...+Why are you here?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What, you don't want to see me?
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:The one I want to see is M4A1 of Griffin.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:She has already been retrieved by Griffin. You can't get your hands on her.+After all, you can barely protect yourself...with whatever troops you have left, can you?
()||:AR-15 raises her weapon and takes aim at the figure before her.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...
()||:Clap! Clap! (Applause)+...A large number of Sangvis units swarm into the building.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Still...so many cards up your sleeve...+You...really are something.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Hand M4A1 over.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Sorry. You had too many chances, but you let them all slip by.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Not this one.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's why I've come to stop you. Because if you set your mind on it, you could very well do it...+You're...a most dangerous one...
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Capable of commanding so many units simultaneously with just a simple gesture...+There is only one who has even higher commanding efficiency than Agent...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>16</BIN>:You are...the Sangvis Mastermind, aren't you?
()||:Clap! (Applause)
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Sangvis recon aircrafts start firing all of a sudden.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...I have my own name.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Cough...+Cough...What a light tickle...from the leader of Sangvis Ferri...+Even M16's punch...hurt much more...
“Mastermind”()<Speaker>“Mastermind”</Speaker>||:You should not have deceived me.+You have an upright personality. That was why you have been chosen as the experimental subject of Parapluie.+I believed you would keep your word, that you would deliver M4A1 to me.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Your database could use some updating, young lady...+16Lab's technology is far beyond your imagination. Even Parapluie can't have me at its mercy.+Not to mention, personality is just a mask. We can turn into anyone...for the sake of revenge...
“Mastermind”()<Speaker>“Mastermind”</Speaker>||:'Revenge'?+A T-Doll giving up its life for something other than its given orders...+...How inexplicable.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Indeed... Of course you'd find it inexplicable...+Up until now... How much havoc have you wreaked?! How many of my companions have you hurt?!
“Mastermind”()<Speaker>“Mastermind”</Speaker>||:...+I am merely doing what I believe is right.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:And so it's war, young lady from Sangvis Ferri...+This is not a game of toy bricks on the floor of your house. Everyone has to pay their price.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If you still don't understand, let me teach you in a more straightforward way...
“Mastermind”()<Speaker>“Mastermind”</Speaker>||:A detonator...+So those explosives are prepared for me...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Next time, please know the difference between a battlefield and a negotiation table.+But this time, please just die.
“Mastermind”()<Speaker>“Mastermind”</Speaker>||:This...means nothing to me.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I know, of course... But I still want to get this off my chest...+Go to hell, Sangvis scum!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+......
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏1>:You know, M4A1, the first time I set eyes on this world, I was buzzing with thrill and curiosity.+I'm not just any mass-produced T-Doll fabricated by IOP. I'm an elite developed by 16Lab itself.+My biggest wish was to carry out many noble orders and make friends with many strong T-Dolls.+Back then, I thought as long as I worked hard, I would become a shining star.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>38</BIN><黑屏1>:But soon enough, my order came - I am to obey your command, and be forever shackled with the AR Team...+The dumb and loud SOP-II, devil-may-care M16, and you, who can never seem to make up your mind...+From that moment, all my possibilities were obliterated.+I hate all of you, but I was powerless against my order.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>17</BIN><黑屏1>:But no matter. It actually doesn't matter, 'cause I just have to keep talking and doing things, and you'll end up needing me.+No matter what you're like, as long as you need me, as long as I can rediscover my worth, I'm okay...+In self-abandonment, I have always been exploiting your kindness and doing such horrid things...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>27</BIN><黑屏1>:I'm so sorry. Only at the moment when I must leave you...did I realize my wish had been fulfilled long ago...+I feel wholeheartedly glad...of every single person we've met, and every single thing we've done along the way...+Which is why I must do something, so long as I can buy even just one second for you guys, so long as I can save one more companion...+It isn't much of an atonement since it's not face-to-face, but surely you'll still accept it through this video feed...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>37</BIN><黑屏1>:M4A1... I have finally paid off what I owe you, haven't I?+That is my final wish. With that, I no longer owe this world anything, right?+But I can't stop thinking about how you'll burst into tears when you see me, the wimp that you are...+...I've been under the command of such a spineless weakling all this time... Seriously, how many times have you dragged me down?+I really should hate you, shouldn't I...?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>36</BIN><黑屏1>:Sadly, the time has come for us to part, M4A1. There's no time to keep such petty scores.+You may feel sad; you may feel angry... You may remember me; or you may forget me...+Whatever the case, just let this memory give you strength and make you even stronger...+Well...take care, my friend...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...A...R...15...+Why...
()||:...Soon after that, M16A1 drags me back onto the aircraft carrier...+At that moment, the propellers of the aircraft were exceptionally grating on the ear compared to the distant sound of barrage, buildings collapsing, and the shouts of Griffin T-Dolls...+They have shredded something in the bottom of my heart...+A tiny wish... A promise with a dear friend...+And the mask worn by a soul...
()||:...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Meanwhile.+...Click.
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:Master, I just reviewed your battle records...+AR-15 caused an explosion in the building which has rendered the rest of your battle units immobile.+Griffin troops have already retreated into the distance. Please terminate the operation today.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Sorry, Agent. I failed.
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:You have no reason to apologize. It is all due to my own incompetence.+(Sighs) I should have sent a few more Ringleaders to your aid, knowing that M4 was literally within your grasp.+But at least now you understand that battles cannot be won through superiority in strength alone.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You knew this would happen all along?
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>19</BIN>:This is not your forte, that is why we are here.+Losing a few units is worth it if it helps you understand this.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||:Did they...sacrifice themselves of their own accord?
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:They did it as per your will and your order - as would we.+Therefore, Master...please give us orders. Use us to your heart's content in doing whatever it is that you desire.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...+But I still don't quite get...+What AR-15 said. I wish I could've asked her more on that.
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I just checked. Your dummy was destroyed in the explosion.+I doubt anyone could survive one of such destructiveness.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:A real pity...+What about your operation, Agent? Is it going smoothly?
Agent()<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏2>:Affirmative. In substitution of AR-15, another Griffin T-Doll has already been planted with the Parapluie program.+Inspection shows that the jammer has successfully transferred the jamming module onto the target. The operation is confirmed to be a success.+As for when to activate it, I recommend holding off till we make our next move.
Mastermind()<Speaker>Mastermind</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood. This time I'll be more patient...+Until...I really get to meet M4A1...
