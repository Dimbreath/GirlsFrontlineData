56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Chief...+Say, it's already midnight. Why don't we grab a snack?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Are you hungry? I have some chocolate here.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Hmm...+That's hardly enough. Not to mention... (takes the chocolate)
()||:Type56-1 snaps the chocolate lightly.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hey, what are you doing?! Don't waste it even if you don't want it!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:This definitely feels like adulterated fat, Chief.+This has to be from 92. She knows you can't tell the difference, so she's always giving you the cheap stuff.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Huh? What's the big deal? It can still be eaten...+You're always very down-to-earth. Since when have you become so picky...?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:56 is a huge foodie. You, on the other hand, could learn a thing or two.+I suggest you tag along the next time 95 and 97 go shopping.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:There are more important things to do. I have no time for leisure.+Besides, don't expect so much in the middle of a mission!+Even if there's to be a proper meal, we have to wait for everyone to show up.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Is someone else coming? I thought we were heading directly to our destination.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:We need to stop by the recon outpost in the area first to meet up with NZ.+She was sent to scout ahead, but now she's back.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:NZ, huh... Do we really need her with us?+That kid is always so difficult. I volunteered to check out the storehouse to avoid her in the first place...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Haha, so NZ is nearby!+Don't worry. I'm pretty close with her. She won't mess around with me here.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:It's okay, 56. NZ is very serious on missions.+Also, we can't use the humans' supplies, so we can't cook until she reports back about the supply outpost.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:What?! Then let's meet up with her quickly! I'm starving!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Chuckles) Hang in there until then...+Commander, please lead us to the recon outpost over there.
