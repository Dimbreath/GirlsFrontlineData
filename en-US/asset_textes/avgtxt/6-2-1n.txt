FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:That's pretty much the plan, Commander. +I'm sending out two T-Dolls as bait to lure Alchemist out. +Your objective is to keep them safe while they're en route to their destination...

FNFNC(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Duh. You'll just have to wait for Alchemist to show herself once you're there, so there's no need for the commander to hang around. +You've backed up your neural clouds anyway. What's there to worry about?

FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker><通讯框>;FAL(0)||:Don't cry, 49! Don't give them reason to look down on us! +Listen up, FAL, don't think you can look down on us just because you're an elite! We're gonna survive this, just you wait and see!
FNFNC(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:That would naturally be the best. We have a limited budget for this operation, so try not to waste it on repairs. +And go easy on your rations. Especially you, FF FNC.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:Save it, FAL! I've had enough of your lectures. Let us go already!
()||:FAL shrugs.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Then please take care of these kitties, Commander. Let's get started.
