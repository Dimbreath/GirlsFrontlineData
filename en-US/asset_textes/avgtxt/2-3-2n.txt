M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M1911(0)||:M21, you're up. Give me some bullseyes.
M1928A1(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Sure. But who should I aim for, the military or Sangvis Ferri?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M21(0)||:Now is not the time for jokes...+Still, seeing that you're a civilian T-Doll, occasional mistakes are unavoidable, aren't they?
M1928A1(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Heheh. How about...raising the barrel by 1cm on the premise of not endangering the operation?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M21(0)||:As long as it's within permissible range of the contract, you can have all the fun you want.

M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M9(1)||:Hey... You said you'd be fine on your own.
M1928A1(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:But the military opened fire without even a word! Even my base got hit by shells!+There are Sangvis everywhere! I can't hold on for much longer!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M9(1)||:It's no use asking me for help since I'm also on the field myself. Go and beg 1911.
M1928A1(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:(Sobs) ...1911, I'm sorry! You win this time!

SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(1)||<BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>:SuperSASS, new recruit at Griffin. Glad to be of help, Miss M9.
SuperSASS(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Th...Thank goodness...+You're my hero, Super...whatever!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;M9(1)||<黑屏1>:It's SuperSASS, Miss M9.+And you're squishing the breath out of me...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>3</BIN><Night>:Phew, thank goodness you'd prepared for backup beforehand. Otherwise things wouldn't have ended pretty for M9.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker><通讯框>;M1928A1(0)||:(Sighs) It only worked because it had quieted down where M9 was, Thompson.
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:True. But SuperSASS is right on time. I was just thinking who to send this time.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><通讯框>;M1928A1(0)||:Hmm? Where to?
SuperSASS(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:To bring Griffin honor and glory, SuperSASS. The organization needs you.
