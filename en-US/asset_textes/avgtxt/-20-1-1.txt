()||<BIN>140</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The four Dolls follow the Fairy twins toward the  【Graveyard】.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:These two fairies...don't talk at all.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:They don't make a sound no matter what you ask them. They're just like Thunder.
TMP(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...I do make a sound. +Listen.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:...Thunder releases the safety on her gun.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Ugh...alright, alright. Don't go crazy.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter if they talk or not, so long as they take us to the graveyard. +However, Leader, you'd better come clean now. +What exactly is going on here, and how did you discover this world?
K2(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...K2 falls silent for a while, then lets out a sigh.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.7</黑屏1>:Fine. I suppose it's better to tell you everything now...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>DJMAX_BELL</BGM><黑屏2>:It all started because of me. +Back when we first got here, I stumbled across this world while I was looking through the database that TMP recovered in the arcade.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:But why did you interfere with the world? Did you have to go that far being a busy-body do-gooder?
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I did it because of Sangvis Ferri. +The S.F. in this world were derived from the data in the Griffin database. +In other words, our world accidentally converged with this one and created a threat.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Then why didn't you just report this to HQ?
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Because I got curious. +I have memories of this world in my neural cloud. +I wanted to find out more about this place...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Why...would you have memories...
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:This world did exist in real life. +These Fairies and their music created a lot of precious memories for humans 50 years ago. +As for why I remember...I suppose it has something to do with my ancestry...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:So you found this place and decided to help clear out S.F. to correct your mistakes, right?
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's how it started, and I enlisted TMP to assist me since she also knew about it. +But soon we realized that there's no end to the Sangvis Ferri infestation here. +For some reason, they regenerate extremely quickly. I wanted to give up and hand this case over to HQ...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:But you didn't give up. You came tonight, didn't you?
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:All because of you! And AEK-999... +She promised me she wouldn't come back. Why did she...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Then how did AEK-999 get involved in this?
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:She came across this world on her own and sneaked in behind our backs. +When we found out about the truth, we told her we're never going in again and she should also stay away, but...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:But she sneaked in again today. +And this time...she doesn't plan on leaving...
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Huh?! What makes you think that?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Is that not true?
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:K2 also shares your suspicion, but I don't believe it! +AEK doesn't always do as she's told, but she definitely isn't someone who'd put play before work!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:I didn't believe it either, but I have a feeling... +...that staying in this world for too long will affect our neural cloud.
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:You noticed that too, 950? If we hand this over to FAL, AEK will be punished for staying here. +So we must sort this out quickly. Find AEK and bring her home ASAP!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:For the record, I am not happy that you did all this without telling Thunder or me... +Not. Happy!
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I know... I'm really sorry, 950. I mean it. I'll reflect on this when I get back. +All I wanted was to settle this alone, but I ended up dragging everybody in... +Maybe...I'm not really a good team leader.
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:You don't have to apologize, K2. This whole business is beyond our understanding.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Ha! Weren't you the one who created this mess to begin with?!
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I...was just doing my job!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Huh?! I don't believe you! You always make unnecessary trouble out of nothing! +If you hadn't bolted just now, we wouldn't have wasted so much time! 
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I told you – you were really scary— +Ow! Ow! Don't pull my ears!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Hey, aren't those headphones?! Why would they hurt?!
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I had them modified! I was just...trying to—
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:What were you trying to do?! Freak! Furry! Closet perv!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:N-no-no, that's not what I meant! Let go!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Stop bullying TMP. +Have we...arrived?
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The Fairy twins come to a stop and stare blankly ahead.
()||<BIN>141</BIN><黑点2>:...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:You're right... +This does look like a graveyard, doesn't it?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:It seems to have been locked up for a long time.
()||<黑点1>:...K2 touches the gate, and it flings open with a creak. +...The twins fly on, and everyone follows suit to explore the Graveyard.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN><黑点2>:It's huge. How long have we been walking now...? +Is AEK really in here?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:I don't think anyone has been here. Let alone AEK...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:Huh? Then where did she go?! We've lost all our leads!
M950A(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Something...doesn't feel right about this place.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:This is a graveyard. Of course it feels off.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:The texts on these tombstones don't seem to be names.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What else can they be?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:No...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Hush... The Fairies have something to say.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:...The twins suddenly turn around.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker>||:...People aren't the only ones that die. +Even things that aren't alive...can die... +If we're all completely forgotten... +We'll die...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What did you say? +And what are you?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:We...are memories that don't want to die...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Memories... +Are you...really...
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:This is the farthest we can lead you.
()||<BGM>DJMAX_BeyondYourself</BGM>:...Rumble...rumble... +...The earth starts rippling beneath their feet.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Now, please enjoy this city's hospitality.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Hospitality...?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||<黑屏1>:We look forward to seeing you survive the end of the moonlight.
()||<黑屏2>:...The Fairy twins vanish into thin air.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:950...did you hear that?
懒散的女孩声音()<Speaker>Lazy female voice</Speaker>||:Humph... +Are the tributes finally here?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Something...is vibrating...
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...M950A rummages in her pocket.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:The earphones...and music player are glowing.
懒散的女孩声音()<Speaker>Lazy female voice</Speaker>||:I've been looking for so long. I didn't expect you to just show up... +It's probably just a coincidence, but that's fate, I suppose. +Now, can I finally have what's mine?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Noises are coming from the ground!
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Grumble...rumble...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Something is coming out!
()||:Figures draped in shadow start crawling out from the earth.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Watch out! Stay together!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What the heck are those?! +This is ridiculous even in cyberspace!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Wraiths... +Legend has it...the Fairies that got captured by Sangvis Ferri... +...would eventually turn into wraiths, trapped forever in the night, roaming and wailing in the moonlight...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:You sure did your research. +I feel kinda sorry for them, but we'll have to fight back if they attack us!
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:No matter who is responsible for this, we can't be sitting ducks! +So it's going to be a fight. +By the by...I hope nobody here is afraid of ghosts?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:I'm not scared of anything that bullets can kill. +What about you, Thunder?
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I find them pretty cool. Worry about TMP.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Whoa! They're coming! They're coming this way! +Is it too late to log off?!
TMP(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Did you forget that we can't actually log off?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Even you...?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's right, we can't log off either no matter how many times we've tried.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Ugh... I have no idea what's gone wrong, but looks like we have no choice but get through this!
()||:...Rumble...grumble...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Hey, there's too many of them! +Can we even handle them?!
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:If you can log off, feel free to backup your neural cloud first.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;K2(0)||:Heh, what a crappy night. I don't wanna be the only one to come out of this alive. +I have to get my hands real dirty, or AEK will make fun of me for being a sissy!
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Right, then here we go!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We've got to make it out of this graveyard alive!
