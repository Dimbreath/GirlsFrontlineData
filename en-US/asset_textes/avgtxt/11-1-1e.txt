NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Commander, I'm leaving today's progress report here.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks, Kalin.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Thank you, too, Commander. +Looks like you've gotten used to working here.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Anything interesting happened today?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Same old, same old. Logistics, repairs, supplies, peaceful news reports, T-Dolls with upset stomachs. +Why would they design Dolls to have food allergies? I honestly don't understand the people at IOP. Is this some kind of Turing Test?
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Anyways, wanna go to the café for coffee after work? +...No reason, just to relax. I know there's only instant coffee here on the base, and we've been ordered not to leave the site for months now... +Hehe, of course, even if it's just instant coffee, it's gonna be on you, Commander.
()||:...Click.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Oh, an incoming call... Class-B encrypted channel. From Mr Havier.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, how are you feeling after a long day at work?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Haha, as you said, there is always more work. That's why I'm here.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Can we have a conversation in absolute privacy?</color>
()||:...I shoot Kalina a glance.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:...Right, I'm guessing the café is not happening.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:No, canned coffee from the vending machine isn't gonna make up for it. I'm holding you to the café.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Kalin waves her time table at me and exits the command center, leaving me to my own device.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry, I told you we won't be talking about work in the command center. That's right, chuck it all aside for now.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Let's talk about a lighter subject today, say...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>How do you feel about doing a little sight-seeing?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><关闭蒙版>:...14:30, the next day. In a dark alley near the Intercontinental Railway Station.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, is this our new mission?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 studies the photograph I just handed her. It was taken in the busy streets of Belgrade. The blurry profile of a man is circled out with a red marker.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But how are we supposed to find him with nothing but a picture taken so far away...? +You say he's an information broker, but does he actually have intel on Ange?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><回忆>:...A day ago.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Our great Chief assigned you a mission, but you haven't been able to sortie as all Griffin vehicles have been sabotaged. I'm sure that's very frustrating.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Which is why you'd better thank me for making this opportunity for you!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You must be wondering what this opportunity is.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Be patient. I'm going to explain everything – all in good time.</color>
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>I managed to get something out of the Chief off the record – Ange might show up in a city in the south.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Naturally, don't bother asking me why she'd go there. I do not understand her motives at all.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Just between you and me, if I were her, I'd have gone out of my way to take credit for what I'd done and asked for a pay rise, instead of running off to who-knows-where without a word.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑点2><黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>So it got me thinking – here's your chance to prove yourself. If you can find Ange, the Chief will be so happy he may even agree to let Griffin have a chopper or two – then you can finally leave the base!</color> 
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2><黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, so now you are probably thinking, how do we find her? I already have everything sorted for you, of course. I'm sending you all the key intel I have gathered. Be sure to thank me for my generosity!</color> 
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><关闭蒙版>:Hello, Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I stare at the photo in RO's hand and sigh heavily. +That's right, all we have is a single photograph and an informant's last-known location. We don't have nearly enough clues to work with. +Finding him isn't even the hardest part. The real problem is whether he actually possesses intelligence concerning Ange. +And then there's this question... Why is Havier asking me to find this guy? +Havier may sound glib and flippant, but I know very well that he's an incredibly shrewd man. There must be a reason why he's entrusting this mission to us. +...Still, this isn't really the time to think about such matters.
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Yes, I heard you. Unfortunately, this is all we have to work with. We'll think of something when we get there.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Okay... I suppose you're right. There really isn't much we can do with just a picture. +Speaking of which, this is the first time I've ever been to this train station. It looks so much more impressive than the one near our base. +The Intercontinental Railway really is something. The last time I took it was with Team Palette... It was the worst train ride EVER. I mean...the train itself was perfectly fine, but my teammates were unbearable. +I hope this trip is going to be a better experience. SOP-II should make for a much better traveling companion than AAT-52. +Still...that was so long ago... We've been through so much in such a short time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>132</BIN><白屏2><黑屏1><回忆>:Five months ago, Griffin & Kryuger took part in a joint operation with the Military to capture Sangvis Ferri's Mastermind, a.k.a. Elisa, and put an end to the artificial lifeforms' rebellion in that area once and for all. +However, we were betrayed by the Military and almost completely wiped out, while Mr Kryuger was arrested on fabricated charges.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>133</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:The Military's actual objective was to seize Mastermind for themselves and to exploit M4A1's connection with her to some unscrupulous ends. +But all that was foiled by a makeshift dirty bomb modified from a Collapse Fluid canister. +The Military suffered heavy losses and were forced to abort their mission, while Mastermind and M4A1 have both gone missing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>157</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:This is what I have been able to deduce by piecing together information I gathered during and after the battle, but is it really the truth? +I can't be certain, but I do know for sure that I, and even the participants of this operation, are not the only ones interested in finding out what had actually happened. +Once the CF radiation started spreading across the theater, the battle soon came to an end.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>146</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:That was when I got captured by the mysterious White Faction. +These interrogators that called themselves Nytos tried to extract information about Ange and M4A1 from me. +I recounted some facts...and also threw some random lies into the mix before I was finally rescued by Squad 404 and escorted to Griffin's new base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>161</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Ever since then, Task Force DEFY and Squad 404 have both vanished into thin air as if they had never existed in the first place. +Through 16LAB's boss Mr. Havier's introductions, I accepted a commission from Zelinsky, Chief of the Bureau of State Security...
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:...to participate in the search for Angelia...ex-Griffin commander, ex-StateSec agent, traitor on the run. +And that...is my current mission.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><关闭蒙版>:But Commander...what are we going to do after we find Ange? Have you thought about that?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry. I know it's not in my place to ask such questions. I'm simply trying to make suggestions...but just thinking about this problem is overwhelming my neural cloud.
RO635-NoArmor(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No matter what you ultimately decide to do, you'll have my full support, Commander. +Oh, SOP-II is back.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:I'm back— Huh? Where's my train station-exclusive hot dog?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Take it. I won't let you squander any more money. Our budget is limited, you know.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Yayyyy! We finally get to leave the base, we should savor it! At least take a picture to show off!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I see you're getting along pretty well with those friends of yours, but I can guarantee that any visual record you keep that's unrelated to the mission will be deleted once this is over... +So, have you figured out where the server is?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I've scanned it with Banana!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:"Banana"?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Yeah, it's yellow like a banana! Persica modified it for me. It's a huge boost to my capability in conducting electronic warfare! ♪
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><Shake>||:You still have...that dinergate with you... Oh boy, it makes me dizzy just looking at it...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Haha, then don't look! +Anyway, I'm sending the coordinates to you now. +Still, I don't understand. Can't we just enter the station directly?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, this is a civilian station for public use, you know? All the entrances and exits are guarded by soldiers of the Military, and the security system monitors all access to the station. +There is probably a warrant on the Commander's head right now, and we are most definitely outlaws ourselves. The moment we scan our tickets at the gate, our identifications will tip off the Military's database within three seconds, and we'll be pinned to the ground by those two burly Dolls merely a second after that.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Is that why we're in disguise?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:At least this way, we won't be exposed by a scan... +I'm going to plant a virus into the server you found. +As our forged IDs are going through the station's security system, the system will skip the authentication procedure and automatically upload these false records onto the Military's database.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Wow! You can actually do that? Can you teach me?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've got Miss Kalina to thank for the prep work... +Even you should be able to handle this kind of simple trick in electronic warfare – that is, if you understand the principle behind it.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:I have no clue whatsoever, but it sounds super cool!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Haha...figures...
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM><黑点1>:Then let's get started, Commander. Please help me take down the firewalls in the server. SOP-II, stand guard and keep watch.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑点2>:Commander, I've hacked into the station's server. Now I need you to find a loophole in the security system for me to plant the virus. +This is your first time hacking a public system? Are you nervous?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:It weighs a little on my conscience, but it can't be helped. I'll get used to it – after all, we're in a very different position now. +In any case, this isn't any different than our electronic battles in the past, so here goes nothing.
