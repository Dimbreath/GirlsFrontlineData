()||:Our enemies are becoming more and more powerful. +In order to improve Griffin's performance during a rare moment of respite, we have enlisted IOP to construct a new training facility and devise a drill for us. +The proposal for this upcoming drill is finally in my hands, but...
Commander()||:...What's this? +There are way too many different types of enemies listed on this proposal.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:That's because we've actually come across this many different types of enemies.
Commander()||:Fine. But the mission duration is far too long...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:We have to prepare for a new situation that's different than the blitz attacks we're used to. +Besides, aren't you the one who made these training requests?
Commander()||:I didn't expect them to go this crazy... +Looks like this time, we'll have to prepare for an all-out offensive.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:You're not scared, are you, Commander?
Commander()||:...As if.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:I do have some good news though.♪ +It came with the notice about the drill. Might ease your mind a little.
Commander()||:What is it?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:During this theater operation, we're gonna run into the commanders from the other bases, so you won't be fighting alone. +As we progress through the drill, all participating commanders will enter the key zone for the final battle.
Commander()||:I see. +Still, is this really necessary for a drill...?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:This is the perfect chance to up our game! +Not to mention that in exchange for our drill data, IOP is going to provide us with heaps of resources... I can already smell the generous rewards! +Oh, by the way, to help us adapt to the drill environment in the shortest period of time, they've prepared theater areas of varying levels of difficulty for us to challenge.
Commander()||:I expect nothing less from IOP. +Then let's go for the easiest mode—
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:What are you talking about, Commander? You've gotta toughen up! +All of Griffin's fate and my bonus lie in your hands, you know?
Commander()||:Relax. I was just kidding. +I'll form a suitable battle plan according to the status of our base.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Haha, that's the Commander I know. As always, I'll do my best to assist you throughout the operation!
