56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:We've been waiting for a while. Did something happen on your way here?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Apologies. There were a lot of Sangvis units along the way. We lost a bit of time making detours.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:No problem. The supplies are all packed and ready to go. Let's move out ASAP.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Is that all? I thought we could at least fill up a few trucks.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:There used to be a lot more...but they've been moved away. That's why I was sent to guard the last of them.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Huh? Is S.F. so poor they have to come after our supplies?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Well...+It was actually the human residents from the neighboring areas, but PR matters, you know...+If Jupiter hadn't attacked, I'm afraid we couldn't even have saved this last batch.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:I see...+All resources are delegated by the military under strict regulations. No one can touch them without permission. Not even humans.+We must protect the rest of the supplies to the best of our ability.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, let's deliver them safely to our destination!
