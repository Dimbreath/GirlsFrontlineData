G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I didn't realize it had gotten dark while I was inside. +Can we sleep now? I'm tired...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Why do you need to sleep? You didn't even take part in the demolition work. +...Gr G11, get your head off my back!
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't wanna, your coat is all soft and warm. Lemme lean against it a little more... + (Purrs) It's so... Ow!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||<震屏>:Get up now.
HK416Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You can just say it, you don't have to hit me...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:You slept till your face went flat, Gr G11. Come, get up, we've got something new and fun to do!
UMP9Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What qualifies as "fun" for you is sure to be tiring. Why don't you guys just have "fun" on your own...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:I told you, you have to listen. Come now, stand up straight and stop leaning on me. +9, what are you talking about?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:I don't know either. +Still, don't you think 45 has a pretty intense look on her face? +Who knows, we might end up being chased around again.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:In that case, I'm going to dump her to reduce my load.
HK416Mod(0);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:Eh...ehhhhhhh?!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(3)||:Haha, this is the only time that Gr G11 perks up!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(3)||:You might be right.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Wait, wait a minute... 45, are you talking about being chased around like in zombie movies or something...?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(3)||:Hehe.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...That's even worse! 416...don't leave me... +There's fog everywhere, my legs have gone numb, I can't move... (Whimpers)
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(3)||:What fog are you talking about, and what would fog have to do with the state you're in? +Why are you being such a drama queen now? Let go of my leg.
HK416Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Snores heavily)
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Something went wrong with her the moment she stepped outside. +What's going on?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Why would a fog suddenly spring up on a clear day?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:It's normal for contaminated zones to be foggy, right?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Even in a contaminated zone, encountering such heavy fog out of nowhere isn't normal either. +No...this isn't fog. It's some kind of interference.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:...Interference? +But to me, it feels like it really exists. It flows when I move my hand. +Still, my neural cloud's been upgraded. I can't believe I didn't notice...
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:The fog is so thick, I can't see anything... It's as if someone's trying to talk to me...but I can't make out what they're saying...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I think I can hear it too... Like it's probing my identity...
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't respond to it. This isn't ordinary hacking, it's a forced connection with an extremely high access level. +This city suddenly generated a huge number of data connections... But the data format is strange; it's not the kind that ordinary Dolls would be able to parse. +However, the connection density is so high that it's interfering with Zener Protocol transmissions to the point where they're changing frequencies, causing our visual processors to receive erroneous information.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:...Scheiße.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If they're trying to jam up our neural cloud processing this way, they're being too inefficient about it. If they can get around our firewalls and force a connection, then why not just directly overload and burn out our neural clouds?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:So you're saying you're the only special case and you can see through this infection?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Earlier, I installed a new module into the code-reading system of this arm in order to hack the Nytos. +This is the best piece of equipment Dier could get. It's holding up against this non-standard protocol data suppression attack, though just barely.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Tsk... quit tooting your own horn. Can you take care of this?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Of course. However, what comes next is going to be a little troublesome. +9, take care of Gr G11.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:Are we really going to do that? —Piece of cake! +Alright then, hang on a bit...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><黑点2>:Three minutes later.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Gr G11's protocol ports are really weird. I have no idea how Dier came up with them. 45, I'm ready on my end！
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is trickier than I expected. +Alright, you can open your eyes now, princess.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:The fog is gone? The sky's a different color from before too. What on earth is going on?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I simply borrowed a trick from someone on the AR Team and closed all the neural cloud access ports on your Zener Protocols. +We won't be able to synchronize our actions or communications through the Zener Network from now on, but it's worth bearing with this for a while. +We'll switch to backup radio comms for the rest of the operation. 
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Is it over? I still wanna sleep some more...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:...Is this what that AR-15 did? I didn't know it would feel so strange to be completely cut off from the Zener Protocol synchronization.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Do you miss being connected to me that much?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><Shake>;UMP45Mod(0)||:As if! Alright, Gr G11, how much longer are you going to laze around?!
HK416Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Fine, I know, stop glaring at me... I'm getting up. +Ah, it's true. The fog is gone.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:That's because you're not picking up the signals that are causing the interference any more. +How is it, can you see the world more clearly now?
UMP9Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:It's the same as before. +Who's sending such a lame scene to us anyway... What a pain.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:It looked like simple fog, but it's actually a massive data transfer into your tiny head. +If it gets really bad, that huge amount of data might end up directly burning out your neural cloud.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Eh?! Is it really that bad?! 
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:That's enough, 45. Who's going to give us support fire if you scare her silly?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Heehee... Just a harmless little joke. Although, Griffin's forces should be in chaos now, right? +Unlike modified Dolls such as ourselves, general-purpose I.O.P Dolls can't close their ports off so easily. 
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Are we going to help them?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Of course. Since we're taking their money for it, we've got to do work for them. +My guess is that after this, they'll be looking for the quarantine wall's control center. +...Wait a minute.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What's wrong?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm picking up a signal source that's stronger than before. It's trying to connect to any interface that it can access. +But the precise location of the signal is... Tsk, so this is how much your detection ability drops after you close your ports, huh. +We need to get closer...
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, the signals from Griffin are starting to weaken! If we don't do something, they'll be completely cut off!
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Rather than waste time helping each of them individually, we should go straight to the cause of the problem. I'm guessing that the AR team will be looking for the source of the interference too, but I can't rest easy unless I do it myself, after all.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||<黑屏1>:Let's go, then. Eliminating the source of the fog will facilitate our future operations. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>157</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:The last gunshot rings out through the ruins, and it takes a long time before its echoes fade away.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:It's finally over. +We've come a long way from the power plant and I didn't even realize it... How much further do we have to go?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Keep moving forward. We should be close to the source of the interference.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I didn't think we'd encounter infected creatures on the way here. +These creatures have really thick hides... If this keeps up, our contract pay won't even be enough to compensate for the ammo costs. +Oi, Gr G11, where are you going?
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:There's a Doll here.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:...What?
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ah, it looks like she's from Griffin.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:But how?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Let me check... Ja, definitely a Griffin Doll. 
UMP9Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I tried calling out to her just now, but she didn't wake up... Is she out of power?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(0)||:She's got a lot of charge left.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:She probably shut down because of connection overload. +Hm...she's a new model. Given how long the fog lasted, in theory, she shouldn't have crashed so soon... So maybe she encountered something else. +Looks like we're heading in the right direction.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:So you were guessing blindly before this?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Of course not. It's just that my instincts were validated. +Since she's collapsed here, we now know for sure — our target must have passed through this place.
UMP45Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What are we going to do now; should we just dump her here?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||<黑屏1>:Just leaving her out here is a little dangerous. It would be bad if she got wrecked by a passing defense mech. +We'll put her in a safe place nearby, then send the Commander a message so the still-functioning Dolls can come over and pick her up.
