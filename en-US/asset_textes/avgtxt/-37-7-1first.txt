TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:How appalling.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The author was very emotional. They seemed to be experiencing some kind of mental health issue.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This must be the journal of the mansion's owner.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes, it turns out the owner was a wedding dress designer and had nothing to do with this ghostly bride. +The journal dates roughly back to the war, and the content also matches up with the time frame.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:It appears the mansion has been deserted since the death of this person. +...But that doesn't really seem to be the case here. Could there be another more recent journal somewhere?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:This one here is the journal of an explorer. Some daredevil adventurer.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Explorer? Why is it here? What does it say?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Mostly just blowing his own horn. +Basically, it's an account of how he broke into the mansion with his friends as a test of courage. +The first half isn't particularly interesting, but there's this part in the second half that bothers me.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Which part?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:He mentioned how one of his friends started acting very strangely. +Not only was he not himself, he did very bizarre things and even attacked the author and the others. +According to the author, he's been "possessed".
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:That's horrific. +Being possessed by a ghost... Could something so creepy really happen?

TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Lee, what's the matter?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:It seems a bit odd that Sten would disobey her orders and act on her own at a time like this. +Or maybe it's nothing. Might just be my imagination. +Let's go.

MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Gr G36c! Where are the other two?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Sorry, I lost them. They were too fast for me to keep up... I didn't expect Fräulein PK to be so nimble.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:That's alright. I'm just glad you're safe. +Tokarev, contact your teammate.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Uh...right, I can talk to Sten directly! +I'll do that right now.
