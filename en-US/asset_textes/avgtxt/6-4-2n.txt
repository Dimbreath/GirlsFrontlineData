炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Your teammates?
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Oui.
炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Feel free to pick it up.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:No need. +They wouldn't dare contact me if they had failed.
炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Humph...
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:You know what, FAL? +That was the only interesting thing you've said all night.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Oh? Then why am I still alive?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Exactly because you're such a banal character. You make dull conversation and have crude tastes. +I only end the conversation when it starts getting interesting. +So congratulations. You've won the Miss T-Doll Who Sustained the Longest Conversation.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I knew it... I suppose no one would be interested in things from a hundred years ago... +But if our mission succeeded, it means you haven't actually harmed your prey. +Why, Alchemist?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:I told you. One should make the most out of what they enjoy, and I can't enjoy dead T-Dolls.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Is that why you've stayed behind? +To abduct our T-Dolls and get high on torturing them?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:What else, FAL? +Does a Doll not even have the right to enjoy herself? +Or do you believe we can only live by the way humans do?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:... +You're studying us, aren't you? You're trying to figure out how our neural clouds work.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Clever girl. But don't ask any more questions. I can tell you nothing more anyway.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Humph. So much for a Sangvis Doll's freedom.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:At least I wouldn't leave a companion in the hands of the enemy to be tortured just for the sake of victory. +Like what you did to FF F2000, right?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:...So you know.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:It only occurred to me when I met you, FAL. +I thought all terrifying Dolls have a special and telling aura, but not you. +You are the single most terrifying "philistine" I have ever seen.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:I don't take risks with no guarantee. +I'm not a reckless T-Doll. I merely plan a step ahead of others. +Besides, becoming your captive was the result of FF F2000's own mistake, but she redeemed herself by facilitating the escape of someone who would provide us with pivotal aid.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Humph... Such a touching sacrifice. Now I regret letting her live.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:It's too late to be jealous. We may be eccentric, but we're not alone. +Now, my friends are coming for me. Isn't it time you returned to where you should be?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Oh? +What do you think I'm going to do? +Take you with me as a hostage? Kill you then leave on my own? Or am I going to blow up the outpost?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:... +I have no value as a hostage. You're in no hurry to get rid of me either since any of your troops stationed outside can do it just as easily. +So my guess is, none of the above.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Correct.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Alchemist raises a pistol and points it at her own head.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Look at me, FAL. Let me watch your face.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Is this the last piece of data that you want to collect?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:I just want to find out...how far I would go to carry out my orders. +I want to know why we are created - as a frame of reference or a means to something...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:... +I pity you, Alchemist.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We are all creatures living in flasks. We have what humans do not possess, but lack what humans are born with... +I want to break free. That's all...
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:... +Are these your genuine thoughts or are you putting on an act to test me?
()||:Alchemist merely grins in a daze.
炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Yes...this is exactly the expression I'm looking for. +You lost, FAL.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:...!
炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:It won't be the last time you do... +See you again in another hell.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BANG! +... +......
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Pathetic.
()||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2>:The next day, in the staff lounge in Area S08.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:You still won't tell us what happened?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Hmm? Didn't you see when you arrived at the outpost?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:You mean seeing you reading your damned magazine next to Alchemist's corpse on a scene that showed no trace of battle?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I told you. She was killed by what she was trying to get.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Whatever... You can't hide the truth in your report to Helian anyway.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:In any case, merci.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Hmm?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Thank goodness you were still trying to come get me. Otherwise, I'd have been killed by the Sangvis troops that had me surrounded. +But then again, wouldn't you be able to keep the position of team leader? +Well? A change of mind?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Don't get the wrong idea. +I WILL take the position from you, but not today. +I still have a lot to learn until I can beat you fair and square. +Does this answer satisfy you?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:...Très bien. +You can keep being my adjutant.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Working with you is exhausting, you know... +Then I'll proceed with my report as your adjutant. +FF FNC and FF FN49 have already sent in their applications. They can officially join the team once HQ gives the approval.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Humph. They're jumping into the fire willingly enough.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:They're doing it because they like me, ma chère.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Ouais, which is why I need you. +Work hard and recruit a few more useful people.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:We'll see how far this problematic crew go... +By the way, FF F2000 needs to make a trip to HQ for her reward. They're also gonna extract some data regarding Alchemist from her neural cloud... +But she can make it to the celebration at noon... Should we also invite T91 and the other rescued T-Dolls?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:If they want to join, sure. But I'll give them the boot if they're too rowdy.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:We can't waste too much time partying. There's a new job coming up. +According to the Commander's report, there are unusual Sangvis signals and some abnormal weather phenomena in Area S09.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Then my schedule is going to be rather tight this afternoon. I have to get a coffee with the Commander and we'll go shopping for that bag...
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Let FF F2000 and the others go with you. I'll take care of the Commander.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:... +Is that a provocation, 57?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Times have changed, FAL. You need to keep yourself on your toes. +Every T-Doll has their own merits. You said that much yourself.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:57 turns and leaves. FAL lets out a sigh.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Life is hard... +...But that's what makes it interesting, right? +That's exactly what you overlooked, Alchemist. +Someone who fools herself into believing that she's trapped in a flask can never break free.
