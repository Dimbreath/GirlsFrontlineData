()||<BIN>72</BIN>:Fifteen minutes later, electronic warfare simulation training preparations complete. Initiating combat mode.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ahem, right. I'm gonna explain how operations work in the Zener Network. Listen up, you two...
UMP9(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP9(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Actually... +It's not so different than operations in reality!
UMP9(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Can I go now?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:W-Wait! I was only throwing in a joke to help you guys relax!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Seriously, please pay attention to this. +You're not overwhelmed only because 9 has very thoughtfully synced your vision to the command system in reality. +This makes it possible to move and fight as if we were in real life.
UMP45(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:So...we'll have to fight in the network too...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Duh, why else would they send us? +Sangvis Ferri will attack us with opposing analog signals. If we launch an attack, we'll have to watch out for their offensive firewalls.
UMP9(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Like that weird-looking thingy...over there?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Exactly. That thing overloads any target it captures. Worst case, it could burn a T-Doll's processor and core to charcoal. +Best stay away from it unless you wanna die.
UMP9(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:This feels...even more dangerous than reality...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Now, we could also run into a lot of firewalls and routes that are only accessible to units with high-level authorization in the network. +Of course we could force our way through...but outsmarting them is more of our style. +So in such occasions...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Ta-daa! The camouflage key I made will save the day! +To make it easier to understand, I've especially made it based on 416's appearance!
UMP9(3);HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're so doing this on purpose!
UMP9(3);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Haha, it does look like 416.
UMP9(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk... So to put it simply, we can pass through routes that we don't have the authorization for with this camouflage key?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Yep, yep! As expected of 416. You understood it at once! +Installing this key onto a route will camouflage our signals as authorized users. +With that, no one will find out about us and we can cruise around in the network to our heart's content!
UMP9(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Cruise around my butt... How is this different than what we usually do...?
UMP9(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm... I don't get it. I wanna sleep...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Tee-hee, that's how 404 rolls! +Anyhow, we'll just have to sim it once and you'll get the hang of it! +I've set up the simulation training. Let's familiarize ourselves with electronic warfare!
