()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the sight of the quarantine wall and purification tower being reduced to rubble, as well as the swarming ELIDs, Ange clenches her fists. +She feels a searing rage but can't muster a way to express it.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:The purification tower is destroyed. +There are traitors among the garrison troops on the wall. The rebels have also blasted through the quarantine wall.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just make your point.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:You knew about this, didn't you?! Didn't you say Statesec had eliminated the infiltrators?! They haven't done anything, haven't they!
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's impossible, even for Statesec, to sniff out every single traitor. Miscalculations are inevitable.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Tsk...there are too many ELIDs and I don't have enough people, not to mention the oncoming storm. Time is short. I need you to send in more troops to lend me support near the wall.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can't.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Why?! +Didn't we agree that you'd provide backup in the case of an emergency?! +...I just need them to round off the ELIDs; that's hardly an unreasonable request!
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The agents have practically been wiped out. I don't have any more men to send.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:...Wiped...out? +How could that be? What about the backup teams?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There aren't any. Those were all we got from the Head of Operations.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:... +Why did they not take such an important conference seriously? +I'll recall my team and head over to the conference hall right away.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That won't be necessary. Continue with your recon work.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:But Ambassador Roshchin...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>He's dead.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't let their sacrifices be in vain. Continue your mission.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:"Don't let their sacrifices be in vain..." +A terrifying idea suddenly occurred to me... Care to listen to my suspicions?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did these suspicions form over the last few seconds?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I believe I'm not obliged to listen, nor am I obliged to offer you any explanation—</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:I couldn't detect even a sliver of shock in your voice. +Even with a will of steel, anyone would at least waver a little in the face of such a crisis... +So I can't help but suspect that everything...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You're overthinking it. As a Statesec agent, you simply have to do your job. That's the only thing you're good for.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Humph, and here I thought I was a renegade.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>All the more reason why you need me.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Do I though?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You think you're oh-so-amazing just because you pulled a few crazy stunts in the past?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Of course you need me if you still want to complete your objective.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have no wish to concern myself with what you have done or who you used to be. Those things mean nothing to me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Right now, I'm the only one who can tell where your loyalties lie, and only I can truly protect you.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I hope you can remember that and refrain from making unnecessary comments in the future. Resume your mission.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:...
