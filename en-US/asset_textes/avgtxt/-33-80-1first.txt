()||:【A fax?】
()||:【Humph... That bastard Havier... What's the point in faxing me a document that's half redacted?】
()||:【Document Number "MB-13-A"】+【Category - Unknown】+【Security Level - [Classified]】+【Source - [████]】
()||:【We now have reason to believe that the OGAS sub-system with which "████" came into contact in the B Incident was deliberately leaked by a certain department in ██████. Justifications are as follows.】
()||:【According to our sources in Moscow, the ████ department in question had repeatedly pushed for the research and development of secondary Relics weapon technology after the end of the war in 2050.】+【All the proposals were firmly rejected by the Central People's Committee, and ████ was sentenced for defying orders and carrying on with the project. 16 people were executed.】+【But it was an undeniable fact that despite the central government's strict prohibition, a group of high-ranking officers within ████ remained interested in the development of Relics technology.】
()||:【Before ████ joined Sangvis Ferri Industries and interacted with the sub-system, ████ from Sangvis Ferri had signed a joint development contract with the Arms Manufacturing Department of ███████.】+【Sangvis Ferri mostly produced low-end melee weapons, so the development of such technology was essentially irrelevant to their market positioning.】+【This has led us to believe that ███████ was not a product which Sangvis Ferri could exclusively manufacture. Instead, Sangvis Ferri's identity as a civilian company was utilized to achieve ████ and ████.】
()||:【Putting that together with the protocol address originating from the Baltic region, which appeared en masse in the Sangvis equipment that we acquired in ██████...】+【We have reason to believe that the B Incident, the death of "████", and ████'s multiple operations within the contamination zone in the Baltics after 2055 were all related.】
()||<黑屏1>:【We recommend increasing surveillance on ███, ███, and ████ in  ████. A serious threat to national security has already arisen within ████. Swift intervention is required.】
