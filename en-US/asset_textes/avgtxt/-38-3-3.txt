()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The sound of a violin...</color>
()||:Henrietta is playing her instrument alone in the garden. +If I have to say, her playing isn't particularly exceptional. Many Dolls at Griffin can play better than her. +However, what truly moves me isn't her technique or timbre, but her innocent figure and absolute concentration.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's a nice piece.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The music stops. The girl turns around, puts down her violin, and runs toward me.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm back, Henrietta.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_27</BGM>:Why didn't you bring me along? It would've been safer if I'd come with you...
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry... You were sleeping so deeply, so...
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:...You don't have to apologize. +I just wanted to make myself more useful to you.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You've already done a great job. +Look, I've got Rico with me.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Rico! +You're back from the Vita.
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Yes. Where is Signore Jean?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Isn't he on a mission with Section 1?
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:He is? +I thought I saw him just now...
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:It's alright, they'll all be back one of these days. +Angelica has also come to the garden. Shall we wait together?
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Since you're so certain, sure. +Oh right, I just had the happiest dream ever. Do you want me to tell you about it, Henrietta?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:What dream?
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:I dreamed that I went to school and had a part-time job like an ordinary girl. Then Signore Jean came to the restaurant where I was working...
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Huh...? Is that so? That sounds really interesting.
()||:Henrietta glances at me. I smile and gesture for her to go and have fun. +She nods happily and leads Rico into the garden by the hand. +Rico must be a very important friend of hers. Sometimes I'm a little envious of young girls for their pure friendship. +I stuff my hands into my pockets and look around. +Going by my previous experience, since Rico is back, SPAS should also have returned to this garden. +I stroll around casually, and just as I expect, I see Cano poking SPAS, who's lying in a heap underneath a tall tree.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Oh, Commander. +SPAS just came tumbling down the tree all of a sudden. Do you have any idea what's going on?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Maybe she's trying to test how well she copes with her body weight in different environments?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Say what?!
()||:SPAS suddenly jumps back on her feet. Her neural cloud seems to have returned to normal. +Simulating the virtual space had taken up most of her computational capacity, but it doesn't seem to have caused any permanent damage.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Huh...? So I'm not in there anymore... +Everything just went dark all of a sudden and the Commander disappeared to who-knows-where. It scared the crap out of me...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How did you get out?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I'm not sure either... By the time I realized what was happening, I was already falling off this tree.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Oh dear... Poor SPAS. Would you like some dessert to soothe that wounded ego?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Th...there's dessert?!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:It's over there on the snack table. Henrietta said we could enjoy anything in the garden. +If we need any help, we can also just ask them.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Alright, I'm going!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You've already become such good friends with them?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:They're all such adorable children. Isn't that only natural?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Canoooooo! +Where's this snack table that you were talking about?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Just stay there! I'll come and bring you to it!
()||:Carcano M1891 gives me a wave and runs off toward SPAS. +I exhale. We've got half of our missing Dolls back. +But I still haven't found the answers to my questions in Rico's Vita. +Who was the creator of this virtual space on Level II, and why build such a place? +Furthermore, why are our Dolls trapped in here in all sorts of bizarre manners? +What Sabrina just said also bothers me.

SPAS12(4)<Speaker>Sabrina</Speaker>||<回忆>:"Until one day, a girl came to me and gave me the power that could change everything, power that didn't belong to my lady."
()||<回忆>:A girl came to Sabrina and gave her the power to change her world. +What exactly does that mean? +Is that girl the perpetrator behind all this?
()||<黑屏1>0,30</黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>259</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:The sky is growing brighter, and another dawn has broken. +Cano rescues a piece of cake from SPAS and gives it to me as breakfast. I nibble on the strawberry cake and watch as the Cyborgs discuss their experiences around the table. +Even though I've stayed in the garden for a very long time, I'm not feeling the slightest bit of fatigue. +The gentle breeze and sunlight are ever so refreshing, not to mention I'm surrounded by cute and lively girls. +This endearing scene, combined with the unique scent of fresh grass, suddenly makes me think that it won't be so bad to stay here forever. +I smack myself in the face to chase away that ridiculous thought, then walk over to sit down on the bench on the far side of the garden. I fill Kalin in on what happened.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><Size=30>But like I said, the Cyborgs here aren't malicious.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><Size=30>Understood, I'll make another external examination. You should also hurry up and find the rest of our missing Dolls, Commander.</Size></color>

Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, who are you talking to?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm?
()||:Henrietta has snuck close to me with nary a whisper. I've been using the encrypted channel so my conversation with Kalina shouldn't have been perceivable.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is something wrong, Henrietta?
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Not at all, I just want to spend time with you. +Fratello don't need a reason to be in each other's company, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's true...
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, Rico just told me she had a really long dream. Was she also trapped in her Vita?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You could say that.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Then thank goodness you were there to bring her back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It is our duty as Handlers to help our Cyborgs, even though I'm not hers.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:But that's what makes you so kind. +Rico is my good friend so I don't want anything bad to happen to her. +Even if it was a good dream, it was still JUST a dream, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Indeed... +Speaking of which... Henrietta, someone in Rico's dream told me that a person had given her the "power to change everything". +Have you met anyone like that?
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Hmm? +I've never heard of anyone like that. +Is it someone outside the Agency?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know. I just find it very odd.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:If you're so perplexed, then let's visit another Vita to find the truth!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now?
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Everyone is busy chatting so I doubt they'd notice if we slip away quietly. +Besides, don't you want to find the other Cyborgs? +I think we only have Claes' and Triela's Vitas left? +Claes and Triela are both amazing so I'd love to see them again soon!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You said they've been in there for a long time. How long exactly?
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Let me see... Around 170,000 hours?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:170... But that's ages!
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Actually, I'm not sure if that's ages or not... +But I did feel a little lonely out here on my own... +That's why I was so happy to see Rico and Angelica again.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... In that case, I'd better get everybody back here soon. +Both for your sake and ours.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yours?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Doesn't matter. Let's go.
