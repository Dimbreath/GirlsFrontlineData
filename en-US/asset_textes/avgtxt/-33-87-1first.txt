NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh, it actually got through.</color>
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Whoa! How come the comms just activated itself?!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>What's the matter? Have you been up to something no good?</color>
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:We were just startled by your sudden forced transmission, Mr Havier!

Commander()||:I doubt you called just to thank us for our work.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know this is a bit abrupt, but don't worry, it just shows that he does like you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Since we're already speaking, I might as well offer a little piece of advice.</color>
Commander()||:Please do.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know you went ahead and agreed to Persica's request, so I'll save you the boredom of listening to more platitude.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, I strongly suggest you don't let Statesec know about what Persica's AR Team brought back.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That thing...could save your life at a desperate moment, but it could also cost you your life just when you think you're safe.</color>
Commander()||:...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>That's it. I won't intrude upon you any longer. I hope your usual luck will persist through the rest of your journey, and I look forward to meeting you in person...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>...If you can make it back alive, that is.</color>
