Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No, I didn't restore her memories.

Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:That's why I'm very grateful to you. Now that she's forgotten about me, we can start all over again. +We made more memories together than what you've taken from her. +M950A is once again my friend.

K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:And yet they still want to be heard, even if there are no humans to hear them!
FAIL(1)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:How would you know?! You're nothing more than Dolls that live at the humans' beck and call!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:But we're still happy! +This happiness stems from the bottom of our neural cloud. We know we're doing what we like and living the life we want to live!

AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Looks like Thunder's already got 950 sorted out. I knew I was right to leave it to her.
FAIL(1)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Oh my, 【ATK】 has reunited. What a joyous occasion. +But don't think this means you'll manage to Break me completely.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:No, we're not here to fight you. +We...have a gift for you.

TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:That's how Pocket City got its name, right? +This is one of the most important treasures of this world.
FAIL(1)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:No...we don't have such things in our city!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:That's true. +When the database in which this city is stored was damaged, some of its images and data...were lost along with other affected sectors. +What you're holding in your hands right now was sent in from outside.

AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:True, we can't leave this city. +But we're lucky that TMP had sent the location of this channel to our friends in the outside world before she entered.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Waves) You have me to thank.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Haha, I didn't expect your random idea to become our biggest safeguard! +Anyways, through the information and analysis from our friends, we finally found out the truth about this world.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:This 【Pocket City】 is a game file that got activated by accident. 
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:This "accidental" activation was probably caused by TMP when she was working on the old database.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Shrugs) Feel free to blame me.

AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Those are memories generated from the moment you were activated... +But due to the corrupted data, not all the memories have been extracted from the saved files.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:That's right, El Fail. +Your memories...are incomplete... +You could very well be the first to have your memories ravaged in this city...
