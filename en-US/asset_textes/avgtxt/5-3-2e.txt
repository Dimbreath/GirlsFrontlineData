()||<BIN>6</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Arrived at the destination. Starting data retrieval...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:M4, have you started retrieving the data?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yes, I am recovering AR-15's neural cloud. Please stand guard.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This is...where we collected data before...+Dammit! So we almost got them last time!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||:That's precisely why Sangvis Ferri is doing everything to stop us.
M16(3);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...AR-15.+Why...can't we at least know her whereabouts...?+She's our companion, right?!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||:...+You once asked me...+Why we're equipped with emotion modules despite being tools of combat.+The thing is, having emotions is a flaw in itself, SOP-II.+T-Dolls or humans, we are all defective beings.+Never expect sympathy from them. Especially not now.
M16(3);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M16...+(Sighs) Somehow you always come up with these oddly reasonable arguments.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||:It's a logic of reasoning designed especially for convincing AIs of Griffin T-Dolls.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Document retrieved. Let us make our retreat.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:SOP-II... I heard everything...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:Sorry, M4A1. I kinda lost it just now...
SOPII(2);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It is all right, SOP-II.+To be honest, I am also very confused right now...+But I believe that AR-15 has not deserted us, nor we her, do you not agree?+So long as we do not desert each other, then one day, we shall meet again.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:...+M4A1, you seem to have matured? ...But you're just an T-Doll.
SOPII(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Smiles) You said it yourself.+I am the commander of the AR Team. I have the responsibility of lead you.
