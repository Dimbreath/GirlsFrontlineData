UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Looks like the fighting's already started on Ange's side. +Has the airdrop still not arrived?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:416 and Gr G11 are already at a lookout point. It's just a while longer until the time Ange gave.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Understood.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Also, about what Miss Ange mentioned earlier...
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:You mean about monitoring M4?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:She told me to report immediately to you if M4 has stopped moving or speaking for more than three minutes. +I think she's now in the state that Miss Ange described.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:I understand. +I'm going into Level II. Can I let you handle the computation for breaking through the outer layers?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Are you going to hack itno Miss M4's neural cloud?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:You could say that. Be quiet when you go in and don't be spotted.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>99</BIN><黑屏1>:No probs, 45~ +Synchronizing.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Is the connection up?
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:Ja, I'm on Level II now. But the design of this base framework... +It's a Griffin model I've never seen before.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:No wonder they say the AR Team is special. You'd never be able to tell the difference just by looking.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:Ugh...the software for analyzing obstacles uses a lot of capacity... +Would a normal T-Doll actually have something of this size installed...?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:Stop here. I'll handle the rest.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:Are you really going to be alright, 45...?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:You might not be able to return if you go further in. +Don't worry, I'm a pro.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏1>:...That's true. I'll wait for you outside.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:UMP45 delves deeper into M4A1's neural cloud.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...There's a ripple in the distance, and I think I can hear a voice... Is it coming from the transmissions interface? +(This signal's waveband looks a bit like the waveform that S.F. commonly uses, but with some differences?) +Hmm...I can hear a voice now.
清澈的声音()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You have become less averse to interacting with me. This is a good thing.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Since you've shown up, I assume you're ready to tell me where they are.
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:And you're prepared to meet her?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:As long as you hand them over.
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You're also starting to become ruthless. +Your neural cloud tells me that once you attain the outcome you desire, you will not hesitate to complete your objective of annihilating Sangvis Ferri.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:That's fine too. It's much better than your indecisive self. +Or perhaps you will let go of such dull notions once you reach out to the child.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Do you still wish to proceed with this trade, knowing that I will destroy you all?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:There is no plurality in Sangvis Ferri. I...am simply me. +Is finding your friends not your wish? I am very happy to grant it.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Forget it. That's all irrelevant. +Give me their coordinates and I will meet with Mastermind as you ask.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I've already given you the location. Mastermind will meet you there.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I don't want Mastermind's location!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You will naturally have what you want when you get there.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I should have made myself very clear!
()<Speaker>Clear voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You once said you could wait. It does not seem that way to me. +Let us both take a step back and do each other a favor.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:I can't trace...this signal... +...Is M4 making a deal with Sangvis Ferri? +If I'm not mistaken, M4 is most probably asking about the other AR Team members... +But why is S.F. paying so much attention to M4...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2>:Back so soon, 45?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:I've gotten the information I need. Put me through to Ange.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Got it. I've prepared a channel already.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Ange, can you hear me?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Let me guess, it's something to do with M4.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Your instincts were right. I intercepted a transmission between Sangvis Ferri and M4. They haven't given up on getting M4, at least.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:A...transmission? Wasn't S.F. tracking M4?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Sangvis Ferri is luring M4 out into the open in exchange for the location of the other members of the AR Team. +M4 agreed to their terms on Level Two, and S.F. demanded that she meets Mastermind.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Why is Mastermind so obsessed with meeting M4...?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Direct that question at Persica.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Good point. But it's pointless to puzzle over this right now. +Can you track the location of the Sangvis unit who was dealing with M4?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:It's hard to explain, but...that signal...seemed to originate from M4's physical location. +So it wasn't so much that she was communicating with them. It looked more like...she was talking to herself?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:...You lost me. +In any case, they must have a prearranged location if they want to lure M4 out. Did you intercept the coordinates?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Did you think I would forget something so important? I've sent them to you already. So, what are you planning to do next?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:I'm going to collect the airdropped items and rig them in the ground at intervals of 500 meters around the meeting coordinates. +Given M4's personality, she's definitely going to head off on her own. Don't worry about her at that point. Everyone else should lie in ambush near the meeting coordinates and find a chance to seize Mastermind.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:A lot of problems would be solved if we could actually capture her.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Humph, that would certainly be nice.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:So if we can't control Mastermind and you can't stop the Military... +In the worst-case scenario, we trigger the devices you had us bury and vanish from the world together with Sangvis Ferri...am I right? +While I don't know what you're airdropping, even an idiot can tell it's nothing good.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:In the worst-case scenario...  +If it really comes to that, I hope you won't blame me.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:You'd pull the trigger without hesitation even if I did. +Don't worry, I'd do the same if I were you. +There's no need to be so pessimistic yet. At the very least, you've always paid up in full, so this time I'll do my best to make you pay through the nose too.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑点1>:That would depend on your skills.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑点2>:Are you really going to use M4 as bait?
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:It isn't time to give up yet, is it?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:I know that. +But if we let her go by herself, even if everything goes according to plan, all foreseeable outcomes indicate that our chances of successfully capturing Mastermind are close to 0%.
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:That's why I'm going to tell M4 our plan.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:You're gonna tell her?
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<黑点1><BIN>99</BIN>:Yes, I believe she will understand. +That's because she was ruthless to begin with, even toward herself. +The option to sacrifice herself...might actually be deliverance for her.
