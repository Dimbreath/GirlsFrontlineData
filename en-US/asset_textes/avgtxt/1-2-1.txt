NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander...+We should be continuing with our drills, but there's been a change of plans...+HQ needs whatever help they can get, so...
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...Let me explain.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Eek! ...Then I'll leave it to you, Miss Helian.
()||:A video call from HQ is patched through.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Stern Woman in Uniform</Speaker><通讯框>||:...+Greetings, Commander.+This is Helianthus, Senior Acting Officer of Griffin.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Let's skip the pleasantries. And for efficiency's sake, just call me Helian.+As you know, Sangvis Ferri has recently launched multiple attacks in Area S09 without prior notice.+This is a huge blow on Griffin's reputation so the higher-ups are taking this very seriously.+As HQ takes on the Sangvis forces, they've also sent me to investigate the reason behind their sudden riot.+Words from above, Commander, are that you'll be assisting me in my work till it's done.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Hmm... Please hold on a sec, Miss Helian.+Our commander just reported for duty and has only participated in one drill. In terms of experience...
NPC-Kalin(4);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(Sighs) ...I know this might be stretching it a bit, but we don't have time or manpower to spare.+But don't worry, Commander. Judging from your past results, you're more than qualified for this mission.+As for experience, you can always get it on the real battlefield...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:According to the latest report, enemy movements were detected behind the field. We're guessing those are Sangvis scouts.+They're very few in number, but we can't possibly let them roam free in times like this.+Please dispatch troops to the designated locations. Destroy the Sangvis forces and command posts to prevent our intel from being leaked.+That is all, Commander. Do your best and show us what you're worth.
