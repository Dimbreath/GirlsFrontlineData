()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Inside the Griffin base.
Commander()||:This one might be a little troublesome...
()||:As I walk through the base, I ponder the mission I have received earlier. +An internationally renowned wedding designer has requested the loan of several Dolls from Griffin to model for a fashion show. +While we've had similar missions in the past, the idea of borrowing Tactical Dolls from a PMC makes me curious as to how the artistic mind works. +Unlike before, the client has further specified that the Dolls need to have "character", that they would have to "stand out from the crowd at a glance", and other such requirements. +Still, the request needs to be met, even if the countless provisions riding on it are somewhat problematic. After all, the payment for this request is very generous. +...If I'm not careful in my choice of candidates our losses would be severe.
???()||:...Commander.
T5000(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I turn back, toward the source of the voice. +The eye-catching red hair of the Doll before me leaps into my field of vision.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Commander, I'm here to deliver the report for our team's logistics mission.
Commander()||:That's it!
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Huh?
()||<黑点2>:...Several minutes later.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:So you want me...to be a fashion model?!
Commander()||:Yes.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:But...why do we have to go? Aren't we Tactical Dolls?
Commander()||:According to the client, Tactical Dolls better suit the design theme of this fashion show.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:But I don't have any experience with this sort of thing...
Commander()||:The mission itself isn't difficult. There'll be people to guide you along the way. +All you need to do is follow directions from the staff. It's much easier than normal operations!
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:But...
Commander()||:If you take part in this mission, you'll have a chance to "transform"! +Plus, the bonus for completing the mission is very good.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:What was that, did you say I can "transform"? +Ahem, wait...however...
T5000(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:T-5000 frowns slightly. +After a brief silence, she raises her head and looks me straight in the eye.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Commander. +I don't really want to accept this mission after all.
Commander()||:Er...why is that?
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:I look distinctive enough as it is. If people take pictures of me and they end up on TV, won't that mean the entire world will know about me? +That would be a fatal blow to the professional career of a sniper!
Commander()||:Actually, it might not go as viral as you think...
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:It's hard enough for me to keep a low profile as it is, so I don't really want to do something so attention-seeking. +Please find someone else, Commander.
Commander()||:...
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:If there's nothing else, I'll be going.
Commander()||:<color=#A9A9A9>(No, I can't just give up like this!)</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>(That's right...since it's T-5000...)</color>
()||:As T-5000 is about to turn and leave, I deliberately raise my voice and sigh heavily.
Commander()||:Sighhhhhh...
()||:T-5000 freezes in place.
Commander()||:<color=#A9A9A9>(It seems to be working. In that case...)</color>+Oh man, what a headache...
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Commander, why are you sighing all of a sudden?
Commander()||:The fashion show is drawing closer and closer, but I just can't make up the numbers... Oh, woe is me.
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Aren't there enough Dolls in the base for that?
Commander()||:I can't complete this mission by picking just any Doll. +There aren't many who meet the requirements to begin with, and now there's one fewer candidate...
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:...
Commander()||:(Sighs) I'll need to submit a list of names to the client in a couple of days. What am I going to do now...? +If we can't complete the mission, we'll end up losing out on a huge sum and we'll have to pay the penalty clause for a breach of contract...
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Ahem... Commander, please calm down and listen to me!
Commander()||:Hm?
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:One of the messages of Crimson Soul Kamen is that you must protect the smiles of people around you!
Commander()||:<color=#A9A9A9>(That's right, that's it...)</color>+What do you mean?
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:After seeing you so depressed, I just can't leave things as they are. +So I'll take this mission!
Commander()||:This is wonderful! You've been a big help, T-5000! +I have something to do so I need to go now, bye!
T5000(0)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, Commander?! You haven't told me what we'll be doing next! +Where are you rushing off to?
Commander()||:I'll give you the mission details later. +Right now, I need to find partners for a hero!
()||:With that, I swiftly leave the corridor.
Commander()||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(I feel bad about leaving T-5000 all confused back there, but I can't give her a chance to change her mind.)</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>(Alright, that's another one in the bag. Now I need to think about the other candidates...)</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:... + ...... +Soon, all the models have been chosen, and the mission officially begins. +After half a month, it is finally time for the Doll models to take the stage.
()||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:Two hours before the fashion show. +T-5000 stands in front of the mirror in the dressing room and examines her appearance.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:This "transformation" is completely different from what I imagined...
PKP()||:What's different?
()||:Before the person next her can finish speaking, T-5000 has already dropped her bouquet and pointed her sniper rifle in the direction of the voice. +After seeing that it is PKP, she sighs helplessly and puts her gun down.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:...PKP, don't just suddenly pop up out of nowhere.
T5000(2);PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:A sniper shouldn't be startled by this kind of thing.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>;PKP(6)||:I wasn't startled, but I almost shot you on reflex.
T5000(2);PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:That's fine. Besides, our guns aren't loaded, so they're nothing more than stage props.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>;PKP(6)||:That's not what I mean... (Sighs) +Forget it. Are you here for whatever reason?
T5000(2);PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:Not really. It's just that the fashion show's about to begin, but one of my fellow models is still busy scowling at the mirror and muttering to herself. +I don't want anything to spoil an otherwise perfect show, so I came over to see what you're up to.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>;PKP(6)||<黑点1>:Sigh... Something has been feeling off ever since I took the mission...
()||<黑点2>:... +T-5000 briefly describes the events which led to her accepting the mission from the Commander.
PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:I see... +It seems the commander's gone to a great deal of trouble to make us take up the job willingly.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>;PKP(6)||:So, you also think the commander was faking it back then?
T5000(2);PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:Does it matter?
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>;PKP(6)||:Well...
PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:Even if that was true, you're here right now, aren't you?
()||:T-5000 stares dumbly at PKP. Her mouth opens and closes a few times, as though she's about to say something. +Just then, a staff member enters the room in a rush.
Staff Member()||:Miss PKP, we need to make some adjustments to your jewelry...
PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll head over now.
()||:PKP turns to follow the staff member. Just before she strides away, she glances around the corner.
PKP(6)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:T-5000, if this is bothering you so much, then find the person in question and get things straight. +The Commander should be happy to answer your questions in order to see this mission successfully completed.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Right, spasibo.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:PKP leaves. T-5000 picks up her discarded bouquet, then she walks toward the corner of the backstage corridor.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Aren't you going to come out, Commander?
Commander()||:Haha...you spotted me after all.
()||:I step out from around the corner and stand before T-5000.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Honestly, since when did you pick up the habit of eavesdropping on people?
Commander()||:I'm sorry...it wasn't on purpose. +You were talking to PKP and I didn't want to interrupt.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Nevermind. You've saved me the effort of looking for you. +So...I assume...you heard me mouthing off about you, right?
Commander()||:Well, I don't think it's all that bad... +And to be honest, I'm the one who should be apologizing to you.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:What are you talking about, Commander...
T5000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:T-5000 looks at me, then she suddenly giggles.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:I'm not here to accuse you of anything.
Commander()||:What? Then you were looking for me because...
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:When I was talking to PKP just now, I came to a few realizations. +I think they're pretty important, so I want to tell you about them, Commander.
Commander()||:So what have you come to realize?
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:While this "transformation" isn't the kind of "transformation" I'm familiar with... I'm very happy that I could be of service. +And also... +If you really need me, you ought to be more honest about it. +Crimson Soul Kamen will never refuse someone who's truly in need! +I'm the same way too.
Commander()||:I understand, T-5000... Thank you.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Whew... I feel much better now. +I'll be off then. The show's about to begin.
Commander()||:I'm counting on you, T-5000.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Commander. You can leave it all to me.
T5000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:T-5000 scoops up the bouquet in her hands and flashes me a confident smile.
T5000(2)<Speaker>T-5000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now then, sit back and watch...as I "transform" on stage!
