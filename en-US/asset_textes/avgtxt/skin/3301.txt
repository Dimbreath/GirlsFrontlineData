()||:The game with the unexpected guest is over. The Griffin representatives suffered a very thorough defeat in the end. +K2 looks at M99, who's in despair, and Gr G28, who's in a daze, then stares at the temporary stage that's being built, and sighs heavily.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(Everyone seems to be in a terrible mood... Even if it's just a game, losing feels awful.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(If I had known this was going to happen, I wouldn't have agreed to play this "Texas Hold 'Em"...)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(How did things turn out this way?)</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:...Let's turn back the clock to a few hours ago.
()||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:K2 is hanging around the table, studying the large assortment of desserts with great interest.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:This one looks so pretty – just like a flower. I wonder what it tastes like. +Hmm, let me try... +Oh! Such refreshing sweetness – fantastic...
???()||:Oooh, so you've got a sweet tooth.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker><Shake>||:Ack! Who's there?!
()||:K2 is startled by an unfamiliar female voice coming from behind. +She hurriedly swallows the mouthful of dessert that almost got stuck in her throat and turns around. +A silver-haired Doll is standing before her. Even though her eyes are closed, K2 still has a feeling that she's been scanned thoroughly from head to toe.
AK12(10)<Speaker>Silver-haired Doll</Speaker>||:Data update. +Griffin T-Doll K2 has low tolerance to spiciness BUT does have a sweet tooth.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I-I don't have a sweet tooth! +Wait...who are you? How do you know about me?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>Silver-haired Doll</Speaker>||:I'm...a secret weapon that works under Griffin's top brass. You can call me AK-12.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Griffin's top brass? +I've never seen you before...nor is there any information about you in the database. Who are you, really?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:As a secret weapon, of course my file would be classified. +You certainly can't access it with your level of authorization.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:But if you're a secret weapon, why would you be swaggering around in broad daylight?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm on vacation. +If you don't believe me, feel free to ask the Commander.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Hmm...this still smells fishy.
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Why don't we play a little game to get to know each other better?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:A game?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Let's play a game of poker. The loser has to perform at the end of the cocktail party.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:I'm...not interested.
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:This is a multi-player game. Don't you want to see your friends on stage?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:But none of them are particularly good at performing... Shoving them on stage on short notice will make them uncomfortable.
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You already assume that you and your friends are going to lose?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:...Ack!
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Do you have so little faith in yourselves? +Is that what the leader of "ATK" amounts to?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:What?! How do you know about that...?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, I once heard the rumor that the leader of "ATK" was actually someone else. +How strange... Do I have to update my database again?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Don't believe that kind of nonsense! +The real leader of ATK is me, K2!
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:A leader who doesn't even dare to play a harmless game? These baseless rumors are going to gain traction at this rate.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:...
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Well, I won't force you. Guess I'll just find someone else... Perhaps some brave soul would be willing to fight for Griffin's glory in your place. +Oh, but most of these Dolls working in the outlying bases are probably cowards like you...
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Stop right there!
()||:K2 stops AK-12 as she is turning to leave.
AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What now?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I don't care what you say about me...but I won't let you belittle my Griffin friends! +It's just a card game, right? Show us what you've got!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:Dammit! Now that I think about it...AK-12 definitely lured us into this trap! +Are all senior Dolls this devious?!
AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:A game is a game. I didn't cheat. +And you participated willingly enough... Isn't it a bit childish of you to feel that way now?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:...Eeep! +You...come and go like a ghost...
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I've been here for a while. +You probably didn't notice me because you're too busy with those silly thoughts tumbling in your neural cloud.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:You...heard everything?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:As the winner, I can graciously pretend that I didn't hear anything – as long as you live up to your end of the bargain.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Then...as the winner, why don't you graciously perform with us on stage?
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't be cheeky. +Trying to back out on a deal after you lost and dragging innocent bystanders down with you if you can't... That's not very nice, is it?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:You're not an innocent bystander at all! +You challenged us to that kind of game even though you're an elite T-Doll... You just wanted to bully us!
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Bully you? Not at all. +Unlike a certain cheater, we take this extremely seriously. To do your best in a game is to show your opponents the greatest respect. +Would you have been happy if we had thrown the game to let you win?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Of course not...
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So are you going to perform, Miss Sweet Tooth?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:Don't call me that!
K2(4);AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Your friends are all down in the dumps, so you want to drag me on stage to save them face. +I understand that, but caring too much about face will only make you suffer. +Just as how you insist on pretending you can take spicy food when you actually can't.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;AK12(10)||:I-I can take spicy food! +If you don't believe me, we can go to a restaurant when this party is over and—
AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That can wait, but the stage is almost ready.
()||:K2 looks at the stage and purses her lips.
AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Well? Be a good sport, will you?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I... Hmm, fine. But there are so many people...
AK12(10)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Relax. Think of it in a different way – this isn't a punishment; it's an opportunity for you to shine.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Humph. I'm only doing this to set a good example for the juniors. +Besides, I've conquered all the dance arcade machines in Pocket City!
K2()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Just like spicy food, a solo dance is just a walk in the park!
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Several minutes later.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><BIN>139</BIN>:...It's finally over.
()||:After K2 delivered on her promise, the cocktail party comes to an end. The guests have taken their leave and the banquet hall becomes empty. +As the excitement from dancing gradually subsides, K2 takes in the stage on which she just performed and chuckles at the irony.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Seriously, I'm such an idiot. +Not only did I not stand up to AK-12 for my friends, I got talked into doing that dance... +I'm not a good team leader at all...
()||:I gaze at K2's dejected figure from behind. As I'm thinking about how to cheer her up, the cocktail party organizer walks up to me.
Commander()||:...This might be a good chance.
()||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I also walk up and start chatting with him.
Commander()||<黑点2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:K2, come here for a second.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Commander?
()||:Hearing my call, K2 makes her way over to us. Upon seeing the organizer, she freezes for a moment, but soon comes to her senses, holds up her skirts, and gives him a curtsy.
Commander()||:Let me introduce you. This is the organizer of our cocktail party.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Hello, I am Griffin T-Doll K2.
Cocktail Party Organizer()||:Griffin's performance was marvelous even though it was ad-hoc. +In particular, your dance was outstanding, Miss K2.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Huh?! +Um...thank you.
Cocktail Party Organizer()||<黑屏1>:Our guests were very happy with your performance, so please accept our gratitude.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +After bidding the organizer farewell, K2 and I head over to the meet-up point outside the banquet hall.
Commander()||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:You seem to be in a much better mood.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:What do you mean...?
Commander()||:I thought you'd feel bad about AK-12 making fun of you.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Oh, that... I wasn't happy that we lost so pitifully...
Commander()||:Sigh, they're a handful even for me. Thank you for humoring them today.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Don't mention it, Commander. +To tell you the truth...it stopped bothering me so much when I saw how much everyone in the audience enjoyed my performance. +Besides, I've never done anything like this before. Now that I think about it, it's quite a refreshing experience.
Commander()||:Really?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Yeah, I actually plan to share this story with my teammates. +That Texas Hold 'Em was pretty fun, too.
Commander()||:Ahem, don't get carried away though.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Haha...I'll keep that in mind. +After all, I did learn a lesson today.
Commander()||:Speaking of a lesson, K2... You actually like dancing a lot, don't you?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:What makes you think so?
Commander()||:You almost seemed like a different person when you were on stage.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Different?
Commander()||:You seemed really free, as if you were born to do this. +You're like a shining star when you're on stage.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:A-All this praise is making me a bit embarrassed... +But to be honest, I do enjoy singing and dancing. It's just that I don't get to do these things very often.
Commander()||:Then how do you feel about having more opportunities to pursue your passion?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Huh? You mean...
Commander()||:Actually, I ran into a talent scout earlier today. +I never really thought about it, but having seen your performance, it gets me thinking... +If you have the choice, perhaps you can start a career that's more suited to you...
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker><Shake>||:... +Are you firing me, Commander? +Is my performance at Griffin so unacceptable that you have to send me packing...?
Commander()||:No, no! Don't take this the wrong way! +Your performance has been stellar, K2. +I'm just worried that your duties as a Tactical Doll are stopping you from becoming a star.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:...Pfft.
()||:K2 stares at me and suddenly bursts out laughing.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:So even you have silly moments like me, Commander!
Commander()||:How can you call your commanding officer silly? Where are your manners?!
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. Still, there are many things that I enjoy doing, Commander. +I like singing and dancing. I like fighting. +I like eating spicy food. I like spending time with my friends at Griffin. +I also like...chatting with you. +I'm here by choice. Even if I had the chance to choose again, I'd still choose to work for Griffin.
Commander()||:That's very reassuring to know.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I'm sorry if I made you worry...Commander.
Commander()||:By the way, I noticed you didn't eat much throughout the whole party. Was something wrong with the desserts?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:No, I tried them. They were very delicious. +I didn't eat much because of some other reason.
Commander()||:What reason?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:They're all too sweet. I need to uphold my dignity as an advocate for spicy food!
Commander()||:...
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:But I did discover many desserts that I really like the look of. I've decided to try to make some at our café – and giving them a spicy spin!
Commander()||:What, spicy desserts?
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That's right, the spiciness will surely make them super memorable! +You've got to come and have a taste... Hopefully once you try them, you'll stop thinking about ditching me!
Commander()||<黑屏1>:Uh...
Commander()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Please have mercy on me...
()||<黑屏2><黑屏1>:... +I have spent another year with these girls – a year that ended with a lovely surprise, though our new beginning was marked with a scary one. +Still, whether these surprises were lovely or scary, they'll all become a part of our memory... +An unforgettable night of sweetness, bewilderment, and laughter.
