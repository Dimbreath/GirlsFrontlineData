()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:…Halloween night.+Checkpoint 3.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Haunted House Adventure has yet to begin, but M1919 is already at her assigned post.+Makarov is a little surprised to see M1919 here this early while passing by, and she goes over to chat.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I see I don't know you nearly well enough.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker><Shake>;PM(2)||:Eeeeek! Oh, it's you, Makarov. You gave me quite a scare.
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Should a T-Doll that's masquerading as a demonic creature be scared by a simple hello? +You're here early. What are you doing?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;PM(2)<Grey>||:
()||:M1919 gives her tactical tablet a wave. Makarov glances at it - it's covered in text.
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you are studying up on vampires.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Heheh, bingo!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You seem to put much more effort in your characterization than the others. +And your costume...is very well done, no matter how I look at it. +I'm sure you've been bombarding Miss Springfield with questions about your outfit, da? Miss Vampire?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Of course! +If I'm doing this, I gotta give it my best. +Especially at an event where I can scare people with no consequences! That's once in a blue moon!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Basically you only want to scare people... +But it sure is astonishing to see a wrecking ball like you studying quietly.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:See? You don't know me nearrrrrrrly well enough!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Seeing how seriously you are taking this, I won't spoil the fun. +Do your best. I hope Miss Carmilla will deliver a big surprise to our patrons.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You can look forward to it! +Speaking of which, why have you come at such a time?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:The two of them continue to banter, unaware of the "surprise" to come later into the night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>87</BIN><黑屏2>:…The long evening goes by in the blink of an eye.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the Griffin Cafe after the conclusion of the Halloween event.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm beat… Who would've thought that a relaxing, fun event like this would end up becoming so tiring…
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, it's me.</color>
64type(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I receive an emergency message from Type64 just as I'm trying to catch my breath.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Anxious) Take your time. What's the matter?
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>M1919 is trapped in a cage. Please come over to the haunted house and save her.</color>
64type(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Worried) What? Trapped in a cage? What's going on?
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm not sure. M1919 might've activated some trap, or perhaps she was tossed inside by a Halloween ghost...</color>
64type(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:…At the very least…our base…probably…isn't haunted.+Yup, there's no way it was a ghost…+I understand the situation now. I'll be there ASAP!
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Good to hear, Commander.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Call ended.+"The base isn't haunted."+Though that may be true, did M1919 run into someone and mistakened them for a real ghost and went to hide herself?+I couldn't help but wonder as I make my way to the haunted house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:…Haunted house.+Although the power is already restored, this venue still oozes an eerie atmosphere.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hello, are you in here, 1919...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(Crying)
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The base isn't haunted… The base isn't haunted…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(Sobbing)
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that crying I hear…?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sound of a girl crying emanates from the corner of a dark room.+Mustering all my courage, I head over to see what seems to be…a large metal cage.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(Crying)
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:1919, i-is that you…?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the faint ambient lighting, I find M1919 sitting alone in a corner of the cage, crying with her hands covering her face. Poor girl.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker><Shake>||:C-Commander…?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I scramble to pry the door on the cage open and carry her out.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I finally found you… You nearly scared me to death…<c>Thank goodness you weren't locked in the men's washroom!<c>Thank goodness you weren't locked in the ladies' washroom!
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:(Crying) You came to save me after all, Commander…+Let's get out of here. This place is so scary… I want to go back to the dormitory…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:M1919 verbalizes what I feel in my heart, but I cannot show any signs of weakness in front of this child.+Obeying her wish, I quickly lead M1919 out of the haunted house.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><Night><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Ten minutes later.+T-Doll dormitory.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's nobody here.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Mhm… This is fine. I wanted some space to calm myself down…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright…+<color=#A9A9A9>(I then inquired to find out that Gr Mk23 mistakened her for a real ghost and locked her in the cage…)</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I take the opportunity to pat M1919's head.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Locking you in the cage and all that, it was a complete misunderstanding!+Don't be sad 1919, I'll get Gr Mk23 to apologize to you.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I understand, Commander…+And truth to be told, I'm not angry at her.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'm just…sad.+The opportunity to scare the Commander that I prepared so hard for has gone to waste…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:T-The opportunity to scare me…+Don't dwell on it. I'm sure there will be many more opportunities like that in the future.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:(Shaking head in frustration) No more… There will be no more opportunities…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why not?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Because…+Because I've already…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>10</duration></闪屏><黑屏1>0,8<黑屏1>:Pop!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,8<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The lights in the room go out all of a sudden.+This catches me by surprise, and just as I am about to call out to M1919…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Ahahahahahaha!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Surprise) What's the matter with you, 1919?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I instinctively reach out to grab her, but there is nothing there.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(Anxious) Where'd you go? 1919!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑点2>:The room is pitch-black, and I can't see anything, so I clumsily rush into the hallway…+But-
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>10</duration></闪屏><黑屏1>0,8<黑屏1>:Pop!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,8<黑屏2>:It's the sound of tripped breakers again. The hallway is now also as dark as the night sky.+"The base isn't haunted."+I don't know why, but that thought popped up in my head again.+…But seriously, what is with the constant power outages here?!+And where did M1919 go?! She was just right beside me!+Suddenly-
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#FF34B3>(Whisper) Ehehehe...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<size=75>WAAAAHHHHHHH!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The creepy laugh appears beside my ear so suddenly that I almost…+This is probably the loudest I've ever screamed since joining Griffin.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hehehe, Commander♪
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Surprise) 1919? Where are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hearing her voice behind me, I immediately turn around to see…darkness.+Suddenly, a pair of frigid little hands wrap themselves around my waist.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Ahahaha! Commander!+…Did I scare you?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:…She really leaves me speechless.+In contrast to just a short while ago, this little vampire is now hugging my back, giggling as if she had just encountered something particularly thrilling.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Commander! Let's go hang out in the cafe!+It's way too dark in here.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Too dark in here, yet you were having so much fun messing around in the dark.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Of course!+I originally wanted to scare you in the haunted house, but with everything that happened, I had to come up with an alternative plan!+I'm such a genius♪
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:…Why are you so fixated on scaring me?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:(Wink) Ehe~☆+As far as the results are concerned, this alternative plan ended up being very satisfying!♪
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Bitter smile) Alright alright, you got me… I did get scared…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hehe, I'm so happy to hear!+Let's go let's go! Let's go to the cafe.+Eh? You're not mad, are you...? It's Halloween so you can't be mad at me for pranking you…!
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Forget it. The deed's already done, so what else can I do…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:That's right! As expected of the Commander♪
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In comparison to being pranked, I felt even worse when I couldn't find you in the haunted house.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:(Pause) Really? You really worry about me this much?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:With Type64 informing me that you were locked up in a cage this late into the night, I'm sure anyone else in my position would be just as worried.+Keep that in mind for the future.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that said, I flick M1919's forehead.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Ouch…
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But it seems like everything is solved now…+So can you not make me always worry so much about you?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, alright♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:…+The night of intense excitement is coming to an end.+Carrying M1919 on my back on the way to the cafe, I continue to wonder when will this child cease to make me worry about her…+I imagine it will probably be a very long time before that happens. I'm sure there will be many more headaches along the way.+Looking into the night sky, I can only softly sigh in my heart.
