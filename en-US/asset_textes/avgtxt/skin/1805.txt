()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:"The most important thing on Spring Festival Eve is for everyone to get together and have a good meal!" +...
()||:In truth, I didn't quite understand that part... It was what Type 81R told me. +However, it isn't often that everyone could get together, so a lavish dinner menu would be good, right...?
Mk23()<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:Darling! Are you listening to me?!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ah...yes!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>129</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><黑点2>:I'm sure everyone will be happy to see how much effort you put into making tonight's dinner,  Gr Mk23.
()||:I head to the kitchen at noon to check on the preparations for Spring Festival Eve. +What I find is Gr Mk23 in a dress, working through a mountainous heap of ingredients for tonight's banquet.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:I don't care if the others are happy! +If I could, I'd make all these dishes for you alone, Darling!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's so much food... I couldn't finish it all even if I wanted to...
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:Honestly! I worked really hard to make these East Asian dishes you've never tried before!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that so? I'll be looking forward to them, then! +However...I've only had East Asian food a few times...so no matter what you make...
Mk23(4)<Speaker></Speaker>()||:Or should I say, this place simply doesn't have what it takes to offer a decent meal...
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:Look at this, it's made with clean, pure fish! I had to cook it a different way because it didn't have extra arms or legs... +And then there's this chunk of beef, which is the centerpiece of this dish over here! I took it off the heat at the moment when it was most delicious! It's filled with my feelings for you, Darling!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That said...the moment it gets served, those gluttons will probably snatch it all up in the blink on an eye, right?
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:I've been spending a lot of time on tonight's dinner... +I couldn't make time for you at all, Darling, because I was so busy finding the correct recipes, making authentic sauces, and so on. +Still, it's all worth it as long as my Darling gets to eat good food...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... thanks for your hard work.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:So, Darling! You have to keep me company once the celebration's over! 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...while I can't comment on my overall schedule, we should be able to eat together, at least...
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hehe...are you happy with just sharing a meal? You can ask for more, you know. +Still, it doesn't matter. Once you try the food I made for you, I'm sure you'll like me even more, Darling!
()||<BIN>128</BIN><黑点2>:On the night of Spring Festival Eve. +While there was a fairly big commotion in the afternoon, everyone has cast the matter aside once the banquet begins.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:Darling~ Are you free now?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? Are you done on your end, Gr Mk23?
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I've finished cleaning up...among other things! +Come with me, Darling. I've prepared a special menu for you!
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<BIN>129</BIN><黑点2>:You see, I actually kept a few things in reserve in addition to the dishes you can see outside... +Only the best for you, Darling!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That sounds tempting. +But I'd like everyone to be able to sample your finest work, if that's possible.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:No! I specially made those dishes for... +...
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:Huh...? It's gone! +Hold it! I put the lunchbox here! Where did it go?!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's gone? Maybe someone served it up?
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:That's impossible! I told everyone in the kitchen that I was holding it in reserve and that they were not to touch it, ever! +How did this happen...? +Why...? It was such a good chance...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr Mk23... +Uh...
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<震屏>:Scheiße! I'm so mad! Who took my packed food!? +Wait here for me, Darling, I'm going to find the thief right now! +Where are the security camera logs! Oi, you lot, get over—!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:W-wait a minute!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I hurriedly pull Gr Mk23 back from the brink of going berserk.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down, just calm down, Gr Mk23! +Put your gun down... If you go out like this, you'll scare everyone!
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:But! But I made it for you...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, it's definitely suspicious how the lunchbox you've poured your heart and soul into suddenly vanished... +But the people on our base wouldn't steal things. It's very likely that someone just misplaced it in the kitchen...
Mk23(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:"I hope..." I add silently, not daring to say that out loud.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:But no matter what...it's still gone... All my effort... I can't believe...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:While it's a shame that I couldn't eat the food you've put so much love into making...you made all the food for tonight's banquet with all your heart, didn't you? +I'm happy enough just seeing how wonderful the fruits of your labor turned out to be. +I'll ask the others if they see the lunchbox, and I'll keep you company until we find it.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Really?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course!
Mk23(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Crap, I think I just made one hell of a promise.
Mk23(4)<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:In that case...maybe I should hope that it never gets found? +Heehee...I'm just kidding. But now that you've said it, you have to keep me company all night!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You just took the liberty and interpreted it as "accompanying you all night", huh... But that's fine too. +The kitchen isn't the best place to be, so let's head back to the dining hall. +After all, over there you'll be able to see the smiles you've brought to everyone's faces.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:After that, in spite of Gr Mk23's grumble about how we wouldn't be alone together out there... +We found two empty seats and enjoyed the lively atmosphere and a sumptuous Spring Festival Eve dinner. +Although Gr Mk23's specially-made dishes had gone missing, she seemed especially happy tonight. +All things considered, it ended pretty well; or rather, it was better this way. +As for the missing lunchbox...that's another story entirely...
