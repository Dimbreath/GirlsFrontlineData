指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's only two more items which haven't been checked yet. +Now, for today...
()||:As I look at the name of the person responsible for this particular item, my heart suddenly sinks.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Urgh... Gd DSR-50's in charge of the red packets... +While she seems like a dangerous one, I think there shouldn't be any problems if I'm just checking her work. +...Besides, I need to deal with this sooner or later, so I might as well go see her first.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:Inside the Griffin dorms.
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Oh my...there you are, Commander...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I came to see how the preparations for the Spring Festival red packets were going. +How's your progress?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Are you only here to ask about the red packets?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is...there anything else you want to tell me?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Not really... +But you can always come look me up for reasons other than work, you know...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That...can probably wait until later, when I have time...
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll be waiting for you then~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So how are the red packets coming along?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:The money and the packets are ready. +Now all we need to do is put one into the other.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, got it. +Please finish up as soon as possible. There's only a few days left until Spring Festival Eve.
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:I've...received your wish. +Now then, Commander...I have a problem that I'd like to consult you about...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What kind of problem?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Should I put a random amount of money into each red packet, or a fixed amount? +The course of the future may change greatly depending on what you choose...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well...let me think about that...
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Not knowing the amount you'll get before opening the packet... +And leaving your happiness to sheer luck is quite interesting, don't you think? +And as their maker...holding everyone's joy and sorrow in my hands is such delicious pleasure...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...well... +I think...we should divide it up evenly.
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Oh?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I would like everyone to be equally happy on an occasion like this.
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:So that's what you think... +Once you make the decision...there's no going back... +Are you sure about this?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes. Do you have an opinion on the matter, DSR?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Not at all... Obeying your wishes is always the priority. +However...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:However?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:...It's nothing. +I'm simply looking forward to the night of Spring Festival Eve. +I'm sure I'll have a very enjoyable time if I spend it with you.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I-I guess...haha...
()||<BIN>128</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:On the night of Spring Festival Eve. +Before the Reunion Dinner begins, the T-Dolls go up with tickets given by Type 81R to redeem their red packets from Gd DSR-50. +As the dining tables get gradually filled up, there are fewer and fewer people at Gd DSR-50's counter in the hallway.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Good evening, DSR.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Hallo, Commander...are you here to collect your red packet? +Show me your ticket, please.
DSR50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I hand her the ticket given to me by Type 81R earlier.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Alright, your ticket is in order. +Here's your red packet. I hope you enjoy it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, DSR. +Oh yes, by the way, have you given out all the red packets yet?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:There's still one left. I'm guessing it's for Fräulein Type 81R.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's probably still busy outside... +Why don't you give me her red packet and I'll hand it to her? +That way you can start eating sooner.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:But I can't hand over a red packet without a ticket, you know~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Aw come on, be more understanding... +Besides, it's the only one left, isn't it?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:I can be understanding...but what will you trade me for it?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:You'll have to pay for the extra red packet, Commander. +Where's your red packet for me?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... +How about I exchange my red packet for it?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Now you're just brushing me off... That's not a satisfactory answer.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you want, then?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:I don't mind if you don't have a red packet... +As long as you satisfy my desires right here.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Wait, what are you trying to do?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it's nothing that'll endanger you... +If you want the red packet...then you'll have to do what I say. How about that?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Alright.
DSR50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:It seems I'll need to please her to get the remaining red packet. +I sigh inwardly and give this dangerous T-Doll a resigned nod.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now then, please close your eyes...
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:I can smell a fragrance in the darkness. +That faint scent steadily approaches as my heart beats faster. +A moment later, something cool and smooth touches my lips.
DSR-50()<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:You can open your eyes now.
()||<BIN>128</BIN><睁眼>:I open my eyes, only to find a red packet pressed against my lips. +Upon meeting my eyes, she puts the red packet down on the table and grins at me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that the last red packet?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Nein.
DSR50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:DSR takes out another red packet and places it beside the previous one.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:THIS is the last one.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait... What's going on?
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:Just a little practical joke. +But your reaction was quite amusing...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:The other one was mine. +Now, give me the red packet that belongs to me. +Then...you can take the one meant for Type 81R.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Honestly, what am I going to do with you...
()||:I pick up the red packet and offer it to DSR with both hands.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er... Happy Spring Festival in advance, DSR.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:And a Happy Spring Festival to you as well...Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I-I think I'll be heading off now... +Thanks for the red packet, DSR.
DSR50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:DSR nods to me with the usual mysterious smile on her lips.
DSR50(2)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I hope you'll have a pleasant night... +And if it's not enjoyable enough...you know where to find me.
