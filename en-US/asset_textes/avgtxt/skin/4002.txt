()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:... +...It's been two hours since the Christmas party ended.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Everyone should be asleep by now... (Yawns) I guess I should get some rest myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Things sure were rowdy tonight... I guess everyone was looking forward to an opportunity to let loose like this. +I should be grateful Christmas exists, for giving them a chance to do just that.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... And that's the end of it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Come to think of it, there was really no need for me to be in such a rush to do this... It would have been fine to take care of it tomorrow. "Work is life", as they say.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>81</BIN><Night>:Springfield must have also turned in as well... Otherwise I could have gone in for a cup...hm?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Shhhh! Not so loud!
()||:Suddenly, someone appears before me... It's HMG21.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You scared the hell out of me... Don't just appear out of nowhere without any warning, HMG21.
()||:The way HMG21 suddenly emerges from the shadows of the doorway has a striking resemblance to Santa Claus.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Santa Claus?</color>+Wait a minute...What are you doing here? If I remember correctly... You're in charge of delivering presents, aren't you?+CAWS should have given them to you, right?
()||:HMG21 suddenly looks uneasy.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I...?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...I'm sorry.
()||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><回忆><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... +Some time earlier.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Wow... This pile of presents looks really impressive...+Good thing each box has their recipient's name on it... I'd never be able to remember what belongs to whom in my neural cloud.
()||:The presents HMG21 received from CAWS are piled up like a miniature mountain in HMG21's room.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:It looks like it's wobbling... It's not going to fall over, is it?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Usually... I wouldn't even think about taking on such a troublesome job... It's just that this time...
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I won't let anyone else have the right to personally give Big Sis her Christmas presents!</color>
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Will she praise me...or say something like, "Danke, HMG21," or something...?+(Squeals in delight)+...No, I can't let my imagination run wild.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I'll celebrate later. There's a mountain of work that still needs doing...literally.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:That's right, I'll pick out Big Sis' present first! +I'll save it for last...or should I give it to her first?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:No, I can't, that'll wipe out my motivation to work... No matter what, I took this job, so I have to finish it.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Ah...found it!
()||:HMG21 looks at Gr G3's present.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I can't believe CAWS bought this for Big Sis... No, it was probably the Commander's idea.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:There's no way CAWS would understand Sis that well. +While it's a bit of a shame that I couldn't take part in picking out her gift myself, it turned out well, so I can't really complain about the result.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...Hm? Vixen?
()||:This is the fox robot "Vixen", named after one of Santa's reindeers. +The Commander specially assigned it to HMG21 in order to help with her tasks.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I was just wondering where you'd gotten to. I'm glad you came back in time for work.+I wouldn't be able to move this many presents without your help.
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep— beep—
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Vixen! Don't run around! You'll knock down the presents!
()||:Vixen seems very excited for some reason and keeps jumping up and down through the room. +The already unstable mound of presents looks like it's ready to collapse at any moment.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:What's gotten into you all of a sudden...huh?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:What's that present you're holding in your mouth... Wait, don't touch that!
()||:As HMG21 freezes for a moment, Vixen bumps into a corner of the present mountain.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Aieeee!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:...
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><黑点2><BIN>81</BIN><Night>:And that's what happened...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +So you're saying you passed out until just now?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...I'm very sorry about this.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No...that's no big deal. The important thing is that you're not hurt. Besides, it's not too late yet.+While it's a shame that you missed the party, don't you think this is nice for getting the job done?+There's no need to apologize.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And it's true, I didn't see you at the Christmas party. +However, not everyone was going to come in the first place, so I was not particularly bothered by it. It's just bad luck.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Actually...there's another, worse problem.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A worse problem? +Let me guess, are the presents damaged?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Nonono, it's not that bad yet. +If I really damaged the presents, I wouldn't know how to explain myself. +Actually...
()||:HMG21 looks away. She seems hesitant to speak.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Can I...ask you to keep this matter a secret from Big Sis?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Just from Gr G3?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I don't care what the others think.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You and that personality of yours... Forget it, I promise I won't tell her. +So, what's the matter?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:... +...I checked the presents after I woke up. +I was very lucky...none of them were damaged. +However, their labels were a mess.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Their labels? Ah... +I see, so that's what it is. I understand. +Is that why you came looking for me?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Ja... +I have no idea where each present goes now... +The only people in the whole world that can help me tell the difference are CAWS and you, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why do you make it sound like some cloak and dagger thing... +Alright, I understand why you've come looking for me. You want me to help you send the presents, right? That was a wise decision. I know who each present goes to even without the labels. +However, why didn't you ask CAWS?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I don't want to.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I guess. That's just the way you are.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Am I being too pushy? +Are you tired now, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, I'm full of energy. +Also, I can't let you go back like this since you've come all this way to look for me.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:... +...You're just acting cool.
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep— beep—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Oh, come on! +I'm serious about helping you, HMG21! Also, I just drank some coffee, so I AM full of energy.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Hm...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Fine, let's go, then!
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Wait...hold on.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? What's the matter?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Actually...there's one more thing.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:One more thing? What else is there besides the labels getting mixed up?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Right... Didn't I tell you just now? +Vixen started acting strangely after it entered my room.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, now that you mention it... Vixen shouldn't be doing this sort of thing for no reason.
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not going to cover for you, you'd better give her a proper apology.
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep...
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Back then, Vixen ran in with a present I'd never seen before in its mouth. +I was taken by surprise and couldn't stop it in time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A present you've never seen before?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:That's right, so I checked that all the presents were okay first. +And then I checked how many presents there were.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...And some were missing?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Quite the opposite, actually... I found that there was one extra.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...One extra?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:That's right.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Bad boy! +I'm guessing the person who lost the present must be really worried, no? Shall we go return it to that person first?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:No can do. +I can't tell which present was the extra one, and there's no time to have you sift through them, Commander. +Also, I have no idea who lost that present...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sighs) It can't be helped, then. +I guess all we can do is deliver all the other presents first. +That way, the last one will be the one that Vixen stole.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:You're right... Tonight, everyone's desire for presents knows no limits. +We don't have as much time as you think we do, so let's hurry and move out!
()||:HMG21 suddenly perks herself up with a few slaps on her own cheek, then turns away and leaves.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh...oh! Aren't we motivated now? It's spreading to me too! +<color=#A9A9A9>...But you were the one who called out to me just now, right?</color>
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Beep!
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><Night>:Hm? This present is for me? ...Thank you, Miss HMG21.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:You-you're welcome. Also, I'm Santa Claus!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>So she WAS up... If I'd known, I would have gone for that cup of coffee.</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<黑点2>:An everlasting lollipop... Thank you, HMG21.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:No problem! I'm Santa Claus, after all... Although, I have the feeling that there's no point if you keep licking it...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Hm? Did I get her the wrong thing?</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:No... It's not like that, I like it a lot... +In any case... Thank you very much for all your trouble. +Ugh... Thanking people in such a serious and proper way... It's just so gross...
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Are you okay?!
()<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<黑点2>:(Snores)
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I can't believe there are some Dolls who are actually asleep... I thought everyone would be looking forward to it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's her, after all. Be careful, don't wake her up.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:She's sleeping like a corpse. I doubt she'll ever wake up.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But we're giving her chocolate, right?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...I'll be careful.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>81</BIN><Night>:Although I personally bought each of these presents earlier today... I have to say, the amount we have here is kind of scary.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:We just delivered the last of them... Hardly anyone was asleep.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, everyone was looking forward to getting their presents from Santa Claus.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...At first, I only took the job because I wanted to personally give Big Sis her present. +But it seems this job is more meaningful than I first imagined.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're happy after receiving everyone's gratitude, right?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:...A little.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In any case, it's almost over... God, I'm so tired.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:You really are exhausted, Commander. +My apologies for making you accompany me for so long.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, it's alright. I was the one who wanted to come, after all. +...Huh? Wasn't that the last present just now? +Why are there two more presents left?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:This belongs to Big Sis.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I see, so you saved it for last.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Yeah... I was worried that I'd lose my motivation if I gave it too early.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Certainly not, I'm sure you're not such an irresponsible person, HMG21. +Shall we give it to Gr G3 first? Or do you want to look for the owner of the missing present?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:I don't want to visit Big Sis while I'm still thinking of work... But I still don't know who this present belongs to. +And Vixen's no help either.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In that case, let's go over to Gr G3's place first. +I feel bad about it, but it really is very late. +We'll just have to find the present's owner tomorrow.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yeah...
HK21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><Night>:We arrive in front of Gr G3's dorm. HMG21 knocks on the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't tell me she's asleep...
()||:The sound of stumbling footsteps comes from beyond the door.
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Sorry! I was...Commander?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a "thud" as Gr G3 opens the door. She looks a little anxious, and she doesn't seem to have gotten a wink of sleep. +The room behind her appears messy too.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you busy?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:No, I'm just looking for something... HMG21?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Gr G3 is about to answer, she spots HMG21, who has taken cover behind me.
G3Mod(0);HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:B-Big Sis.
G3Mod(0)<Grey>;HK21(2)<Grey>||:
()||:HMG21 calls Vixen to her side somewhat nervously.
G3Mod(0);HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:M-Merry Christmas! This...this is for you!
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:There it is!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Huh?
()||:Before HMG21 can finish, Gr G3's face breaks into a delighted smile and she takes the extra present from Vixen. +It's plain to see that HMG21 doesn't know what is going on, and she has a blank look on her face as she holds the gift she is going to give Gr G3.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...I see. +Is this present yours, Gr G3?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Yes, that's right... I've been searching for it all afternoon. Thankfully you brought it back. +...But why is it with you?
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Huh...huh...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What the heck, we've been running around all day and it turned out like this. +...No wonder Vixen was so worked up, was it feeling happy on its owner's behalf? +...+...In that case, I ought to be heading back.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Huh? Commander?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm very tired and I want to go back right away to sleep... +I'll let you sisters take care of the rest between yourselves. +(Yawns) So tired..
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Commander... +...Danke.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Think nothing of it.
()||:The Commander turns and leaves.
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:HMG21... It's a little late now, but could you please accept this present?
G3Mod(0);HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:Is...is this really for me?
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;HK21(2)||:Of course. I prepared it for you. +I thought I'd lost it, I was so scared.
G3Mod(0)<Grey>;HK21(2)<Grey>||:
()<Speaker>Vixen</Speaker>||:Beep—
G3Mod(0);HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||:M-me too... Please accept this present!
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;HK21(2)||:Merry Christmas, HMG21.
HK21(2)<Speaker>HMG21</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Merry Christmas, Big Sis!
()||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1> :... +Both the feeling of wanting to receive presents and wanting to give them are the same for everyone. +Those who are baptized are grateful for their baptism, while the ones who administer it bestow their prayers. +That is the meaning of Christmas.
