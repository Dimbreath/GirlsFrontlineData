()||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:The Christmas Eve celebrations are about to start. A few impatient T-Dolls have already assembled at the square where the Christmas tree is. +According to the schedule, the first part of the event features Springfield giving out presents as Santa Claus. +Although it is tradition to put Christmas presents quietly by people's beds in the middle of the night, the instant gratification of receiving gifts means more to T-Dolls. +Of course, measures have to be taken to prevent them from messing around too much. +Just as I'm thinking about how to keep Santa safe, a metal bucket falls right in front of me.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoa!
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Who's down there? +Oh, Commander?! Are you hurt?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, I'm fine... +But who's this...?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||:It's me, NTW-20. +What, can't recognize me just because of this flimsy disguise, Commander?
NTW20(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I pull myself together and finally realize it's NTW poking her head out. The two twig-like things on her head are meant to be deer antlers.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, it's NTW... What are you doing up there?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Preparing for the event. +Want to come up, Commander? The ladder is at the back of this depot.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll be right up.
()||:I climb up to the depot's roof and find NTW cleaning up scattered objects.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Sorry about just now, Commander. +I didn't expect anyone to be around so I didn't pay attention...
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, it's okay. +I should've been at my office waiting for the event to begin, but something came up and I had to head out... +What are you setting up here, NTW?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:I'll be sniping from here when the event begins. +But the roof is unexpectedly cluttered so I have to empty up some space to settle down.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh...so you're Springfield's "partner"?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Yeah.
NTW20(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW points at her antlers.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Springfield said according to human traditions, Santa Claus comes with reindeer or something, that's why I'm in this get-up. Is it weird?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, not really. +It's really festive, and it suits you.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:...It just feels a bit awkward for a hunter to dress up as prey. +But if you say so... I guess it's fine. +In any case, we'll have a delightful hunt today.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know how much you enjoy hunting, NTW...but don't go all out today. +The main objective is just to ensure Santa can deliver presents to everyone. +Even Santa will be sad if people don't get their presents.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Commander. +I know full well what my prey is today. +I shall decimate the avarice of those who plot to sabotage the festivities and seize all the presents for themselves!
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good. +That reminds me, is there any Christmas present that you want, NTW?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Oh, even the reindeer gets a present?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. Everyone at the base deserves a gift at Christmas.
NTW20(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW frowns and ponders for a while.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:I can't think of any present that I want.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then...what about a dream that you want to come true?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:A dream... I guess I want to see snow.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:See snow?
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Yeah, it never snows where I'm from. +I've trod through boundless deserts and prowled the deepest reaches of wild jungles, but I've never seen snow. +I hear the scenery is stunning when it snows. I really want to see it for myself...
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, a white Christmas is quite a sight to behold.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:But it's just a thought. +After all...the weather doesn't change to satisfy a hunter's caprice.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, hard to say. +Christmas is a time when dreams come true.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Come on, Commander. +I'm not a child... +But I'm very glad that you asked me about this.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's almost time, so I'll leave you to your work. +But...I suggest that you look forward to your Christmas present this year.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I've already consulted the weather forecast while planning for the Christmas event. +It's a sunny day today, but I still have to add some final touches to make things more festive. +It's also for the sake of granting their wishes.
()||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:After the commotion on the square died down, NTW didn't hurry to get indoors. +She sits on the rooftop and looks up at the starry sky.
NTW-20()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:It's such a clear day... It can't possibly snow.
NTW20(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><震屏>:NTW hops off the roof and makes her way toward the banquet hall. +A low buzz starts coming from the corner of the square. NTW pauses by the Christmas tree.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:...What's going on? Have they left behind some sort of machinery outside?
()||:As NTW is searching for the source of the noise by the Christmas tree, a white snowflake lands lightly on her shoulder.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||:Cold! ...It's...snow?
()||:She opens her palms to catch the snowflakes drifting down from the sky and dubiously watches as they slowly melt away.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Christmas really is a time when dreams come true, isn't it?
()||:The snowmaking machines are working perfectly. +It took a lot of effort fixing them in the last two days, but just one look at NTW's expression makes it all worth it. +NTW turns and looks at me, a content smile on her face.
NTW20(2)<Speaker>NTW20</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander... +Now I truly believe in Santa Claus.
