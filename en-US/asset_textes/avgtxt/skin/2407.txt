()||:...In the Griffin base.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Yes, I understand. +There's a quota of T-Dolls that can be brought along? ...Alright, I understand. Thank you very much. 
()||:I hang up, and then exhale deeply.
()||<黑屏1>:After the conclusion of the series of events, I had finally managed to secure a vacation to a far-off destination.
()||<BIN>129</BIN><黑屏2>:But this might not qualify as a good thing... For instance, I am facing a crisis now.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Guten Morgen, Commander. Why are you standing here?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, Gr G36...my apologies. I wasn't thinking and ended up walking to the kitchen. +It's kind of like this...
()||:As though seizing onto a lifeline, I explain my current predicament to Gr G36.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I see... Then how about going to the beach?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I doubt any of us has seen the sea before...at least not like the uncontaminated sea in documentaries. What do you think?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That does make a lot of sense. There's a quota on how many T-Dolls I can bring along this time round, and I want to invite those who have contributed the most.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:A wise decision. +It will also encourage everyone to work harder, which is a good thing.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll need you to help me with the preparation work, Gr G36. +...I'm just no good at that sort of thing.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:To serve you is my calling. Please leave everything to me.  +But before that, I hope you will permit me to make breakfast for everyone.
()||:Gr G36 bows to me, turns, and leaves.
()||<黑屏1>:With Gr G36's help, everything goes very smoothly.
()||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:The next day, on the beach.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Everyone has arrived, Commander. +First, we'll give everyone some free time, followed by group activities in the evening. The specifics and timeframe of said activities will be left to your discretion or a suggestion from the group. +As for the catering, I will be preparing snacks and iced drinks for everyone as refreshments, while the company will arrange dinner on the plane.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you for your hard work, Gr G36. +Do you plan to enjoy some free time yourself? +(She's changed into a swimsuit, but she doesn't look like she's going to relax...)
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Of course not, Commander. +I am here to help. I will continue to provide service so everyone can spend this vacation in comfort.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hang on, you were one of the people invited for this holiday. Shouldn't you at least take a break?
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:What you say makes a lot of sense. +But what shall I do in my free time?
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm... There's sunbathing, swimming, playing beach volleyball, or just about anything else. +You'll be much more comfortable if you relax, and you'll feel better too...
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Indeed, there is much merit in your words. +However, preparing food for everyone will allow me to cool down the T-Dolls from running around under the sun as quickly as possible.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(But you're going to overheat yourself.)
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:If I can set up parasols and arrange the venue in time, everyone else can rest more comfortably after they're done with playing. +Some of the T-Dolls present aren't exactly thoughtful, nor do they pay much attention to details, and a maid exists to make up for that shortcoming. +Being able to make everyone happy makes me happy. +...That, I feel, would make me happier than resting.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:（...To think Gr G36 could actually speak this eloquently!) +I will respect your wishes, Gr G36, but please don't push yourself too hard. +Remember that we're here on vacation, so there's no need to be as alert as usual.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Understood, Commander.
()||<黑屏1>:Despite her response, I can't sense any sign that she has changed her mind at all. +Still, I can't demand anything of her when she's like this. +If she likes toiling for the sake of others, then I shouldn't deprive her of her pleasures...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I'll let her do what she wants.
()||:But soon, I had to abandon that idea.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander, bad news!
P38(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This slushie tastes great. What do you think, Ameli... +What happened?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:R-really bad news... Gr G36 short-circuited!
P38(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:I run over with P38. Leaning against the parasol, Gr G36 seems to be in a very bad state.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36? Are you alright? Can you hear me?
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...My sincerest apologies to have worried you, Commander. +My signal reception ability is not impeded... It is only my frame that is a little overheated. +It would seem my thermal dissipation module is too outdated.
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Leave that aside for now. +I'm taking you back to the break room. Have a good rest there.
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:No, there's no need... +I can still work, it's not often that we all get to come out like this...
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Listen to me, Gr G36. Leave that aside for now.
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But...if I collapse now, who will take care of everyone?
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you don't rest now, everyone will have to take care of you. +I hope you will have a good rest and recover fully before thinking about work.
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But...
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you think the ocean is beautiful?
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Very. It's more beautiful than what I've seen in the documentaries.
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then stay here and enjoy it with me.
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...I understand. It would be my honor. +But before that, could I ask a favor of you?
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm?
G36(9)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I made some new slushies. I believe those two T-Dolls over there are also guests of yours? +Please take these iced beverages over to them. +Whatever the circumstances, we cannot allow Griffin's hospitality to suffer...
G36(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Al...alright. You wait here.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:How can I get Gr G36 to relax? +I ponder the matter while delivering the slushies.
()||<黑屏1>:However, I am unable to find an answer even after returning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:I'm back.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ah... Welcome back, Commander.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like you've been resting properly. Were you looking at the sea?
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ja...it's beautiful. The colors are so vibrant and so pure. +I never thought that I'd be able to see such a beautiful ocean during my time in Griffin or before that.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's true. There are too many contaminated zones.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ja. +Nor did I ever think I would meet a commanding officer who's as kind as yourself.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm a little embarrassed to hear you praise me, Gr G36.
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:There's no need to be humble. I'm feeling better now.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you alright? If you still feel hot...
G36(8)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I won't push myself, Commander. +Please believe me. I will handle my work in the best possible condition.
G36(8)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She turns and looks me earnestly in the eye. +The light in her eyes is far more dazzling than the ocean.
G36(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I see. +I believe you.
()||:With that, Gr G36 throws herself into her work once more. 
()||<黑屏1>:Fortunately, she does not get overheated again.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Welcome back, Commander! +New bills have arrived~
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm home. +...Wait a minute, new bills? Didn't we settle them all before the vacation?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hmm...that we did. +However, we received complaints during the vacation. The T-Dolls' free activity caused some damage to the environment.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I've already compiled a list of the payments to be made and the overtime charges for the logistics teams.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This...
()||:I feel a little dizzy as I look at the final figure on the bill. +I know the T-Dolls hadn't done it on purpose, but this figure...our budget...
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Are you alright, Commander? +You look unwell.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Sorry for worrying you, Gr G36. +Everything is fine. It's time to get back to work.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Your expression does not indicate that you are fine. +Still, please continue to let me share your burdens.
()||:...It would seem that in order to get Gr G36 to take a good rest, we'll have to start by not doing too many things to make her worry. +And so, the vacation comes to an end with expenses that skyrocketed...
