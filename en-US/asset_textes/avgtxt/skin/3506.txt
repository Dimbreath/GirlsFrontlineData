()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2>:...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...Commander? +What's this sudden meeting about?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I have a tricky assignment for you.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Please explain.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Half an hour from now, I'm going to convene a briefing about an operation to search for mermaids. +You and QJY-88 will be in the rescue team together. +The mission is pretty laid-back in itself, you just have to make everyone's safety your top priority.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Thank you for entrusting me with this task. I'll do my best to see it fulfilled!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:However, QJY-88 is a special case. +She isn't equipped for maritime battle. +Her lack of swimming capabilities, coupled with her fear of the unknown...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:I understand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Seeing that you've received professional training, I'm leaving her in your good hands.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Leave it to me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Take some time to think about how best to proceed. +Now I need to make other arrangements.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:I've been entrusted with such an important task, I must not let the Commander down. +I'd better hurry up and design a life-saving course tailored to QJY-88...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Fear of the unknown, huh... +Hmm...then I should first start with contact with the sea...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:0400 in the early morning. +Having finished coming up with the rough structure of the training course, Serdyukov walks past the factory and notices that the lights are still on. +Thinking that someone must've forgotten to turn them off, she enters the building to do that, but finds an exhausted QJY-88 trying to fight off sleep.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:(QJY-88?) +(What is she doing at such an hour?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov slips quietly behind QJY-88 and sees the pile of blueprints and calculation drafts sprawled across the worktop.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:(Looks like she's also working very hard for this mission.) +(I'll also do my best to help you, QJY-88.)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:She backs away just as silently.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The next day, 0200 in the morning. +Serdyukov comes to the factory again— the lights are still on. +She walks inside and finds QJY-88 asleep with her chin resting on her hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Serdyukov lightly puts some snacks down, then slips away.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:The third day, 0600 in the morning. +Serdyukov arrives at the factory again.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:QJY-88 is sleeping soundly right on top of the work bench, with some sort of device held tightly in her arms. +Serdyukov sighs softly, takes a look at the time, and turns back to start packing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Six hours later. +The mermaid investigators have arrived at the designated beach.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An hour later. +Serdyukov drags QJY-88 out of the large crate she's been huddling in and pulls her towards the glittering blue sea, with the brilliant sun shining above their heads. +She looks sideways at QJY-88, who's shuddering with her eyes squeezed shut.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Was I as frightened as QJY-88 on my first maritime mission?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<回忆><BIN>163</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Take a deep breath and relax. +It's just a mission on the sea, it's not so different than missions on land. +You're a professionally-trained Tactical Doll, so don't behave like a total rookie...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Alright, Serdyukov. +I'm going to start counting down from 5. When I reach 1, I'll go and carry out my mission with grace and confidence.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:5...4...3... +2... +1.9...1.8...1.7...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +What the hell am I doing...? +This is...so silly...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Is everybody ready? +Please come and assemble over here! +I'm going to walk you through the operation.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Don't panic! Be confident, be graceful! +Serdyukov, you've got this!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:...That's about it. +Any questions?
()<Speaker>All Squad Members</Speaker>||:No, all clear!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Excellent, now spread out and get yourselves warmed up. +Serdyukov, please stay behind for a bit.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Do you have some other mission for me, ADS?
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Nope. +You just look very nervous. +So I'm just wondering how you're doing.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Thank you for your concern. +But if you're referring to my darting eyes, I'm just staying vigilant and keeping my eyes on my surroundings.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:(Am I that obvious...?) +(I've prepared so much for this though.) +(I've memorized all the replies to the "How to act like a pro on my first maritime mission" thread on Griff-chan...)
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:"If you're spotted for being nervous, just casually brush it off as vigilance." +By the way, I was the one who resolved the "How to act like a pro on my first maritime mission" thread. +It was made anonymously so I wasn't too sure, but now I'm absolutely certain after you said that.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<黑点1>:People are giving us curious looks. Let's move to the depot over there.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2><BIN>89</BIN>:Serdyukov, this is your first maritime mission, isn't it?
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +Yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't⁠—
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:I know what you want to say, Serdyukov. +I picked you to join my squad because I have faith in your abilities and professionalism.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Thank you...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Many Dolls who have never worked with me before don't trust my performance in battle because of my physical appearance. +They tend to treat me as a child and mess around with me, but wouldn't take the mission seriously. +Which is why I'm very grateful that you trust me, Serdyukov.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Right, now I'm going to explain the differences between missions at sea and on land. +You've mostly been assigned the latter, right? +Actually, they aren't all that different, in my opinion...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Yeah? I agree!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Mhmm! You just have to bear a few things in mind...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:An hour later.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:That's pretty much all there is to say. +I'll explain the rest when we're in action.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:You know, I actually prefer underwater missions, especially the ones under the sea! +I've seen jellyfish before. They look really pretty and delicate. The way they drift and sway in the water is so mesmerizing it's almost dream-like. +If we see them, I'll point them out for you!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Sure, I've never seen sea creatures before. +Come to think of it, isn't it about time we started the mission...?
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:We're working in pairs for this operation. +I've already grouped up the others, so you can be my partner. +Let's work together then.
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Hold on, partners are required to stay together by sharing a safety cable, right...? +If something happens to me in the process... +It doesn't matter much if I retreat, but you have to remain on the field, don't you...?
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry, this mission is only moderately difficult. +We'll definitely complete it, just follow my lead! +I have high hopes for you~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:So that's pretty much it regarding basic life-saving techniques. +Now we should start patrolling to make sure everyone is safe!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I have accumulated a lot of knowledge about life-saving, but somehow I have a feeling that...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Don't worry, let's revise everything as we make our rounds!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:After an hour of patrolling.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Did you hear that, Serdyukov?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Hear what?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I think someone's shouting for help over there...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:You think so? But the sea looks very calm to me... +Let me check with my binoculars.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov returns to where she placed her bag for her binoculars. +A black crow comes out of nowhere and stares curiously at her bag. +She pays it little attention and keeps rummaging through her bag. +However, the crow tries to make off with her belongings from the bag. +Serdyukov opens fire decisively to scare it away.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:My old code name was Crow, but that doesn't mean I'll condone your mischief.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Serdyukov returns to her search for her binoculars, but suddenly hears QJY-88's shout.
()<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:R93! +Hang in there! I'm coming to save you!
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:QJY-88!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov turns around in shock and sees QJY-88 dashing towards the sea. +Under the brilliant sunlight, QJY-88's footsteps disrupt the calm water surface as she kicks up pearly seafoam.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:QJY-88...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The seawater gradually climbs over QJY-88's waist, chest...and QJY-88 dives head-first into the sea... +Serdyukov watches with bated breath. +A few seconds later, QJY-88 finally resurfaces. But just as Serdyukov is about to relax—
()<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Help! Cough, cough! +I...(gurgles)...can't swim!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88 struggles helplessly in the sea and starts choking on water. +Serdyukov looks further into the distance and can just make out the pink hair billowing like seaweed in the ocean... +Her processors go into overdrive, calculating the probabilities of successfully rescuing both Dolls in her current condition. +Serdyukov can feel her neural cloud heating up with every negative conclusion she draws, and finally terminates her calculations.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:I can only save one... +I'll get QJY-88 first since she's closer... R93, forgive me...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +QJY-88! I'm coming to help you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Serdyukov runs towards the sea with a swim ring. Following QJY-88's route, she starts swimming ferociously after the drowning Doll.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>163</BIN><回忆><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Serdyukov! Stay there and don't move! +I'm coming!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...Okay!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Here, give me your hand!
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:Good. Now jump towards me. +Don't look down. Keep your eyes on me, Serdyukov!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:I'll...try...
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||:We trust each other, right?
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Right.
ADS(0)<Speaker>ADS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then leave yourself entirely to me, Serdyukov!
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>10051</BGM>:Just as I trusted ADS back then, QJY-88 and the Commander have both placed their trust on me. +I can't let them down!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov swims towards QJY-88 with even more gusto. +She's getting closer and closer, so close she can practically touch QJY-88 if she just reaches out. +Suddenly, an object falls right next to her from the sky. She can tell with a single look that it's her sunglasses. +Before she can react, her belongings start raining down from above one after the other. +She looks up and finds the crow that she scared away is now carrying her bag and dumping everything inside right onto her... +Serdyukov starts panicking. She tries to pick up her things as she avoids getting hit herself, all the while worrying about QJY-88... +Soon enough, certain mechanical components in Serdyukov's lower leg start malfunctioning due to the nerves and vigorous movements.
SPS(3)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Go away! Dammit... +Argh! (Gurgles) My... +...leg...is malfunctioning... (Gurgles)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Serdyukov!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:Serdyukov grabs her leg in pain and starts sinking. It feels as if the ocean is dragging her into the abyss.
SPS(3)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:How could I screw up at such a crucial moment...? +Calm down! Take a deep breath...cough, I forgot I'm in the sea... +What should I do?! Somebody save me...
SPS(3)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +QJY-88... +Save me...
SPS(3)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hmm...is that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>162</BIN>:QJY-88's arms circle around Serdyukov from behind and holds her tight.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...QJY-88? +She actually remembers the life-saving technique I taught her! +She's even applying it perfectly!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov slowly begins to relax. She feels safe in QJY-88's arms.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Judging from the distance I've swum, it'll take a while for QJY-88 to reach the shore. +I suppose I'd better adjust my respiratory system and save up on... +Hmm? Huh?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Serdyukov is suddenly raised right out of the water. +That is when she suddenly realizes...that the water is only about 1.5m deep.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:......
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Let's...get back to the beach first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two flustered girls make their way awkwardly to the shore.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment their feet reach the soft and dry sand, they slump heavily onto the beach.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Pff-Hahahahaha...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Hahahahahaha...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:That must've been... +One of the top ten ordeals I've ever had in my career, hahaha...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:No, it was all my fault...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:If you hadn't come and saved me, we'd both be lying in the repair bay. +I knew I was right to have faith in you~
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Ugh... Thank you, Serdyukov. +If it weren't for you, I'd probably still be cowering in the big crate. +I would definitely not have the courage to run out to sea... +Though we could both have...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...I won't tell a soul. +In return, don't mention my malfunction just now...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Serdyukov... Haven't we forgotten something...?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +R93 is still... +We've got to tell the Commander right now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:On the beach bathed in warm sunlight, the two flustered girls set off running hand-in-hand.
