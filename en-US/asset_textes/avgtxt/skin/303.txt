()||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Early morning, December 25th. +After yesterday's merrymaking, most of Griffin are still slumbering in blissful dreams. +Only a few staff members in charge of daily duties are milling about the spacious base. Even T-Dolls that are known for being early risers are nowhere to be seen.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Phew... It's nice to get some fresh air... +But it's freezing...
()||:The well-decorated Christmas tree is still standing in the center of the square. +A familiar T-Doll is dragging along a large red sack, wandering around the tree.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who's there? +...M14, is that you?
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Hearing me, M14 picks up her sack and runs over.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Morning, Commander!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you doing here so early?
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I glance at the half-opened sack. It's full of exquisitely wrapped gift boxes.
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are these?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:I'm collecting all the presents that got left behind last night! +Springfield said I could do it later, but I wanna give everyone a surprise when they get up in the morning! +Everyone should wake up with a present waiting by their bed on Christmas morning!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... Thanks for going to such trouble, M14.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Heheh, it's nothing! As long as everyone's happy, I'm happy too!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then let me help you.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Oh, are you sure? Don't you have work, Commander?
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nothing urgent for now. I guess even our superiors are still taking a break. +Let me pick up this stuff with you. I could use some exercise too.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sure! I'm even more fired up with you here, Commander!
()||<黑点2>:M14 and I spread out and collect the Christmas presents scattered about the courtyard.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm done here.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker><通讯框>||:So am I!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I've worked up quite a sweat... +Let's take a rest by the vending machine.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:Roger! I'll make my way there now!
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I met up with M14 in the resting area by the vending machine.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Hmm... SAA cleaned up really thoroughly.
()||:I buy the last two cans of juice, hand one over to M14, and sit down next to her.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:These are the only ones left. Don't know if you'll like them.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:I love this flavor! +I like it even more since it's a treat from you!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, good to hear.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:I seem to be in luck. +Springfield treated us to juice yesterday, then you did the same today.
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh? Springfield treated you too?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Yeah! She even talked to us about the plan on Christmas Eve.
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The plan on Christmas Eve?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:She asked me if we had anything special planned for Christmas Eve. +So I told her we were planning to rob Santa Claus for fun!
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:I almost spit out the juice in my mouth.
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Cough... You told her everything just like that?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Of course! It must've been important coming from Springfield, right?
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:So she's Springfield's "source".
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Okay... And?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:She said she'd be organizing an additional secret event to go with our plan! +But since I already knew about that, I couldn't participate in the Santa Claus robbery.
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Good thing you didn't.
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:If the other T-Dolls ever find out about this...M14 will have hell to pay. +She blurted out everything without even being baited into it. She's like the extreme opposite of SAA...
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M14, you must NEVER tell anyone about this.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Hmm? Why?
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...Because it's Springfield's surprise for everyone. +It'd ruin the fun if they know it's planned beforehand, right?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:But...isn't it over already?
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just don't tell anyone. +That's an order.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Understood! I'll obey your order!
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thank goodness she's easy to deal with. But I wonder if her cluelessness is a good thing or a bad thing... +I shake my head and finish my juice ruefully.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<震屏>:Oh no! There are still some presents left in the banquet hall! +How could I forget about them?! But everyone's about to wake up soon. What should I do? What should I do...
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't worry. Let me take care of the banquet hall.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:But you've already spent enough time on this...
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not as roomy there so there won't be as many left behind. +Just go and deliver the presents, Santa.
M14(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The dejected M14 perks right up at that.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Am I Santa Claus too?
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. Whoever delivers presents to people is Santa Claus.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Then let's go! +I'll leave the presents in the banquet hall to you, Commander!
M14(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No problem. Off you go.
()||:M14 makes a beeline for the T-Dolls' dormitories, then turns and waves at me.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Commander! The juice was delicious, thank you!
()||<黑屏1>:I wave back, and watch as her jolly figure disappears down the road.
