()||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Griffin base.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN>:Decorations, presents, venue preparations... All checked. +Alright, next on the list is food and beverages.
()||:Outside the wine cellar, I run into WA2000, +Who, according to Springfield's arrangement, is in charge of beverages for this event.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:What are you doing here, Commander?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Springfield asked me to check the prep work on the resources needed for Christmas.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:That's hardly necessary... +My preparation is naturally impeccable!
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I believe you, of course, but I still need to do what has to be done. +Just think of it as a routine inspection and let me take a look.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:V-Very well. +No sneaking drinks even for you, Commander!
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...For some reason, WA seems a bit strange today.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So I'm nothing but an alcoholic to you...
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...No! It's just a reminder! +A-Anyway, get to work already! I've still got things to do.
WA2000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2>:I check the purchased beverages in the cellar according to the stock list and quickly notice a mismatch.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:WA, I just checked the list. We seem to be missing five bottles of champagne.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Oh, that...I broke them by accident when I was moving the crates.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why didn't you tell me before?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:There's no need to report something so trivial, is there? +I was just about to head out and buy some new ones, but then you came.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... +Sorry for keeping you from your work.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Humph. If you get it, then move along already. I need to lock up.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How about I go with you as an apology? It's not easy for you to carry five bottles of champagne on your own, is it?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:It's a piece of cake for T-Dolls. +But if you absolutely have to come...it's not like I won't let you.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Then without further ado, let's be off.
()||<BIN>84</BIN><黑点2>:WA2000 and I walk together along the street. +She's in casual dress today, looking no different than the chattering girls on the street... +If not for the enormous travel bag on her shoulders.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why are you carrying such a big bag, WA?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:We T-Dolls always carry our firearms with us even on normal occasions. +That's common sense, Commander!
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know that, but your rifle isn't the only thing in that bag, is it? +These furry things are...plush toys?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Don't touch them! Th-They're just ordinary presents.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright... But aren't they heavy?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:That's none of your business! +Let's hurry and buy what we need to buy. If we can't make it, it'll be entirely your fault when we get scolded by Springfield!
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Okay, okay. Milady's word is my command.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...Humph.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:WA2000 and I arrive at the alcohol section of the supermarket. We put the champagne into our cart. +Just as we're about to check out, WA2000 stops at the wine shelves.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it, WA? Have we forgotten something?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Glühwein. +We drink this at Christmas where I'm from.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really? Then here.
()||:I put the bottle that WA has been staring at into our cart.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:But it's not on the stock list, Commander.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I just want to try it. +Mind sharing it with me tonight?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Gosh... If you want to try it so much... +I guess it doesn't hurt to have a drink with you.
()||<黑屏1>:WA turns away and pushes the cart toward the checkout section. +She might have agreed a bit grudgingly, but I'm sure I saw a smile.
()||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Back in the cellar at Griffin base. +WA picks up the bottle of Glühwein that she bought with the commander and sighs.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Goodness... Everyone is such a handful.
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:WA2000 recalls what happened earlier in the day...
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||:Please, WA! This is a crucial part of our plan! +These are electronic pets that we modified ourselves... Take them as gifts of thanks.
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||:Yeah! We beg you, WA! Just let us have five bottles!
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||:And don't tell anyone!
()||<BIN>89</BIN>:WA2000 looks at the bag full of bribes. +She finds herself in the toughest dilemma ever.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:What to do? Should I tell Commander? +...Humph. Why should I worry about that idiot? +Surely the commander can neutralize such a tiny threat.
()||:WA2000 stands up and puts the mulled wine carefully on the table.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Besides, I've been toiling away the entire day... +This wine will make up for it nicely. +But...when should I open it? +...Guess I'll do it 'then'.
()||<BIN>81</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After the Christmas Eve celebration kicked off, the T-Dolls' little plot was naturally foiled. +The clamorous interlude has not ruined anyone's festive mood. The T-Dolls keep up the joyous buzz late into the night.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:What are you doing skulking in the corner, Commander?
WA2000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:WA stands before me, holding two glasses filled with dark crimson liquid.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hello, WA. I'm taking a rest here after a day of work. +Aren't you gonna drink with them?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:I've taken pity on you sitting here all alone, so I'll keep you company. +It's not like you've got anything to do at the moment, right?
WA2000(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:WA places one of the glasses in front of me. I can immediately smell the aromatic wine.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, thanks. +What's this?
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Glühwein. +...I'm just keeping my word from this morning.
()||:WA2000 mutters and sits down next to me.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Merry Christmas, WA.
()||:I raise my glass toward WA. She purses her lips, then clinks her glass lightly against mine.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...Merry Christmas.
()||<黑屏1>:The heated wine warms me up from head to toe. +I look at WA's profile and spy a rare smile on her lips.
