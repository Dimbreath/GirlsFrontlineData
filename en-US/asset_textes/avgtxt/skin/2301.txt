NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Welcome, Com...dear customer.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem...good afternoon.
NTW20(4)<Speaker></Speaker><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>||<黑屏1>:I arrive at the cafe entrance to see NTW doing her best to play the role of a maid. +I don't want to upset her, so I let her guide me to a window seat.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2>:What would you like to order, Com...I mean, dear customer. How about a cup of afternoon tea? +Or would you like to consult the menu first? We have many...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Relax a little, NTW. Just call me Commander.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:...Gotcha, Commander!
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, maybe not that relaxed...
NTW20(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW looks visibly relaxed after receiving the permission to do so. +She wheels a food service cart over to me and bows with a smile on her face.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Now then, Commander, welcome to our cafe. What would you like?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll just have a cup of black tea...+I'm not familiar with all these weird names, did you come up with them?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Very well, Commander. As it happens, I've been practicing tea-brewing recently. You must sample the fruits of my hard work!
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that so? Well, if you specially practiced for it, then I'd like to give it a taste. +I'll leave it to you, NTW.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Understood. I shall serve you my finest afternoon tea.
()||:The fragrance of black tea spreads as she works her hands. +She must have put in a lot of practice, given her fluid movements.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Alright, it's done.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It looks good. Now then...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<立绘振动>:A moment please, Commander!
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is it?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:This might sound a little sudden, but please allow me to taste-test it for you.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why? Not confident in yourself?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:You would not be wrong to say so. +As you can see, I'm not good at things outside of combat, and this is my first time taking on the challenge of brewing tea. +However, since I'm making it for you, I'd like to make it as good as possible.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I-I see... Alright then.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Let me have a taste... +Hmm, I think I put in too little sugar. +No, in that case, I'd need more tea leaves. +...But then the taste would be too rich. Please let me brew a new cup for you. 
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(So she hasn't perfected it yet, huh...) +Alright, go ahead. 
NTW20()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:But it tastes too bland this time, it needs more adjustment. +...No, this won't do, it doesn't taste right either...
()||:Twenty minutes later.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:NTW...isn't it done yet?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I think it still needs some adjustments...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's fine, I have faith in the results of your training. +Also, I really am getting a little thirsty, so don't worry so much and just give it to me.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Alright, please let me try one last time! +...Um, this one is a little sloppy, but I hope you like it.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, NTW. +Let me give it a little taste... +Hm...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:How is it, Commander? How does the tea taste?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Frankly speaking, the taste is quite ordinary; I can't tell the difference between it and the stuff made from a teabag...but I can't say that, right?) +I think...it's above average. +But I don't know this sort of thing too well, so all I can say is that I have no problems drinking it.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:So you're saying it could be better? +Honestly, I think it's tastes pretty good to me.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't beat yourself up over it. I think it's alright as long as it's drinkable.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:You don't need to console me either. I understand that you're trying to spare my feelings, am I correct?
NTW20(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW taps the side of the saucer with her fingertip.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Perhaps it's because the sensory organs of Dolls differ from those of humans. +However closely our appearances mimic those of human beings, we still differ in many areas.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It's definitely possible there might be a discrepancy in our senses. +Come to think of it, I find the chocolate that FNC eats to be very bitter, but she thinks it's very sweet.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:(Sighs) ...This is hard.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you talking about getting tea to taste right?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Yes, it's much more difficult than fighting. +In battle, all we need is precision and firepower, but tea is different.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, it's very difficult to cater to everyone's tastes.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I would like to train myself to Gr G36's level of skill, or at least to approach her in this field... +Perhaps this experience...could be useful for reference in combat. +What do you think, Commander?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36 is already very hard on herself. I don't think you need to go that far.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:What do you mean by that?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know much about making tea, but I think being able to make tea that most people enjoy is good enough.  +As for the problem of ingredients that you're grappling with, cafes in the past would provide a variety of choices and let the customers decide what they wanted.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I didn't know you could do that! +I expected nothing less of you, Commander, you showed me the way in an instant.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad I gave you some insight. Now then, I'll be heading off...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<震屏>:Please wait! +Commander, if you're free, please come here for tea while I'm training over the next few days! +In fact, it would be best if you could come every day!
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah? +You want me to...taste test?
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Yes! If you, as a human, feel it's acceptable, then surely it should be fine for other humans! +This is very important, so you have to come.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...
NTW20(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:NTW suddenly rises to her feet, looking a little embarrassed.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander, please excuse me...
NTW20(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah? Alright.
NTW20(4);GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:NTW? Where are you going? +...That's the Doll's restroom.
NTW20(4)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>;GepardM1(2)||<SE>RunStep</SE>:That's why I need to go—
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:What...is it break time already?
()||<黑屏1>:NTW vanishes into the other end of the cafe. +She left so quickly that I had no time to give her a reply... +Crap, doesn't that mean I'd have to come over every day? +...Was I too hasty when I said I'd help them with their training? +Doubts begin to creep into my mind as I face the service cart sitting in front of me. +Oh well, we'll just have to prepare ourselves for this so we can overcome this challenge together...
