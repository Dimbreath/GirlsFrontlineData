()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>2</黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Before the day of the anniversary.
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2>2</黑屏2>:A bit more to the left. Good, just like that.+Alright, hang this one up next.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:(Setting the place up? That's weird. Didn't they already finish yesterday?)
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点1>:I faintly hear someone giving out instructions as I'm passing by the café.+Out of curiosity, I decide to take a look.+With one hand on her waist and the other pointing all over the place, SR-3MP is standing in the middle of the room directing her helpers.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2>:(...Eh? Why is SR-3MP here?)
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hey, good morning, Commander.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ah...you noticed me already...+Good morning to you as well, SR-3MP. Say, what are you doing here?
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Can't you tell? I'm decorating the place for the party, of course.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:But why?+If I remember correctly, Springfield had assigned M1918 to be in charge here.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Pfft, she decorates like a granny!+If an honored lady such as myself is attending, then I naturally have an obligation to spice this place up~
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Like a granny... You don't pull any punches, huh...+M1918 would be heartbroken if she hears that.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That's why I didn't tell her~+I'm such a considerate person, don't you think, Commander?
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Yes... I don't even know if I should praise your sense of self-importance...
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Come on now, it's not like a half-assed Doll like M1918 even cares about this sort of thing.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Are you sure?+She might give you a half-assed beating if she does.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Of course I'm sure~+Besides, it'll surely be perfect with me at the helm, so there's no need for you to worry, Commander.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(There's no point arguing on with her. I'll tell M1918 about it later...)+Right. You're full of energy today, SR-3MP.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Hmph, I'm full of energy every day!+It is a big loss for the company to have not invited me to the banquet!
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Yes, I feel sorry for them.+You must look especially beautiful in a dress.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Huhu, you have impeccable taste, Commander~+If I can't get the spotlight at the banquet then the party will have to make up for it!
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You seem to have frankly said something awfully extreme again.
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Turns head) Hey, don't put this here! Put it on the shelf over there!+Hey, hold on with the flowers over there! Leave it till later!+What are they gonna do without me...
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Um...
SR3MP(0)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Turns head) Is there anything else you need, Commander? I still have things to take care of.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点1>:After the conversation, SR-3MP turns her full attention back to the café.+The Commander, standing aside, laughs helplessly and leaves the café afterwards.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the internal party.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:With a glass of alcohol in her hand, SR-3MP is standing on the side with a sullen look on her face.+I walk over beside her, yet she strangely didn't notice me.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hey SR-3MP~
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏>:...Eek! Commander!+When did you get here? I didn't even see you!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What's the matter~+It's not like you to space out like that.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Mmm... Because I'm pissed off.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Because of the argument with Skorpion earlier?+Don't dwell on it. You look suuuuuuuper dazzling today.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Even with your compliment, I'm still not feeling better...+The argument pisses me off too!+...But the person that pisses me off the most is her!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Who?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:M1918!+If an honored lady such as myself got serious, I would never lose to that Skorpion brat!+Yet, M1918 just had to butt in and screw things up. Now I can't let it go.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:But it's better to not spoil your mood with an argument. You should be enjoying the party instead.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:If even the Commander agrees with her...
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:But...
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hm?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I suppose...M1918 is a little more mature than I am.+But just a LITTLE! So little that I can easily surpass her if I felt like it!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Laughs) Oh? Miss Whirlwind is actually complimenting someone else?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hmph, an honored lady such as myself is not the type of boorish and pretentious Doll that looks down on others.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Although you do have an excessive sense of self-importance...)
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:M1918 was on the guest list of the banquet, right, Commander?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Yes.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I heard a lot of important people were there...+So the fact that M1918 was there means she is only a little, LITTLE bit more mature than I am.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:So you've finally realized.+You and Skorpion were the ones stirring up a commotion and M1918 was the one trying to defuse it.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Tch... Anyways, that's what I've been thinking about.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:So did you come to any conclusion?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Quiet voice) I...maybe...need a little more training...
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:If you can hone yourself to the level of not bickering with other children, you'll be good.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hmph, I'll hone myself to the level of being invited to the next company banquet!+I will surpass M1918 in a year's time!+An honored lady such as myself will be the first person on the guest list next year!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I can't wait.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:Good! Look forward to it!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I feel relieved now that SR-3MP is back to her energetic self.+Who knows... Maybe in a year's time when SR-3MP has finished her training...+She'll be the one to defuse conflicts between immature Dolls.
