()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1><震屏3><黑屏1>:...+<color=#A9A9A9>...Christmas comes but once a year, it would be nice if this one didn't begin with a headache so early in the morning...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><BIN>81</BIN><黑屏2>:...So, what happened?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>When I arrived at the scene of the disturbance, what greeted me was a mess of a corridor.</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Ah...you've come at last, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The first person to see me was AA-12, with an annoyed look on her face. She looks immensely relieved; she's clearly been in distress for a long time.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:AA-12... So that noise just now was Gr MP7?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:I'm not too sure myself. In any case, you should go over and take a look for yourself. +I seriously don't want to get involved in this...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand how you feel...and I think I have an idea about what happened here.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<震屏3>:It's strange, don't you think?! Why is it that I have fewer and fewer lollipops, even though I haven't been eating them? It must have been your rat's doing!
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Betty is NOT a rat!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Pretty much what I expected...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There there...Gr MP7, Honey Badger, stop fighting. I could hear you from my office. +What's going on?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Ah, you're just in time, Caretaker! +This rat has been ordering her rat to steal my lollipops!
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Betty is not a rat! Betty is my friend! And I'm not a rat either! Also, you were clearly using violence on Betty, weren't you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's enough! Quit fighting! If you ask me...<c>This is Betty's fault...<c>You overreacted, Gr MP7.<c>Why don't the two of you each take a step back?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Both</Speaker>;PDW(2)<Speaker>Both</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:HELL NO!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:No I didn't!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I know, right!
MP7(0);PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:It's just a lollipop, right?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;PDW(2)||:"It's just a lollipop" — I can't believe you just said that, do you know how offensive that is?!
MP7(0);PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:And what's wrong with that? You're not a kid any more, it's unbecoming of you to flare up like that over a mere lollipop.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;PDW(2)||:Why you—!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:ENOUGH!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Neither of them looks like they're going to give in, and the fighting is getting fiercer by the minute. I can feel the beginnings of a headache in my temples.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The two of you...are always at each other's throats, aren't you?+<color=#A9A9A9>And why would Betty eat lollipops...? I don't get it, is it deliberately trying to make Gr MP7 mad?</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Of course! I hate her!
MP7(0);PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:The same.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Grrrrrrr—!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Both of you, stop fighting. +...I have a plan.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:... +...After the explanation.
()<Speaker>Gr MP7 & Honey Badger</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Whaaaaaaat?!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Is your brain malfunctioning, Caretaker? Why should I give a present to someone who stole my lollipops?!
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I was just about to say that, Commander. +I do not understand the point of doing such a thing. +What good would exchanging gifts with her do?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, both of you calm down and listen to me. +If the two of you keep arguing like this, there'll be no end to it, don't you think? +Since nobody wants to back down, why don't the both of you reconcile on even terms...? That said, do you remember what day it is today?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:...It's Christmas.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:It's Christmas, right?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad that you know. I don't want to referee a duel on Christmas, so wouldn't it be perfect to settle the matter in a way that's befitting Christmas? +I'll give the two of you one day to prepare. The winner will be whoever's gift impresses the other more, and the loser will have to apologize.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:No way! Giving this rat a gift is nothing more than a waste of time and money!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you're saying... +You're worried that you'll lose to her in a challenge like this, Gr MP7?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:...+Say what?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I knew it. Gr MP7 raised her voice.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>She's not stupid, but she's easily baited.</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:How bold, Caretaker... To think you'd actually dare to say that. +Bring it on, then! You think I'm scared?! +You'd better have your will written and waiting for me, you dirty rat!
()||:Gr MP7 storms off angrily.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Honey Badger's gaze feels like it's piercing through me.</color>
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Settling things isn't an issue. After all, Betty and I won't lose no matter what we compete in. +Since you requested this, I'll play along, Commander... I just don't want to lose to her. +In any way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've been meaning to ask, but do you and Gr MP7 have some huge grudge against each other?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Well, it's not up to that degree. +I guess we just don't get along?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't think that's simply a matter of "not getting along." +It's true that Gr MP7's always been that way, but I also know she's not a bad girl. +It's the same with you, Honey Badger. You've always been very reliable...you and Betty.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Is that why you came up with this weird "present exchange" idea to encourage us?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course the so-called competition is just an excuse. If possible, I'd like this to be a chance for the two of you to make up with each other. +After all, the way you two keep feuding everywhere you go causes me a lot of headaches.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:It's not that I don't understand what you're trying to do, Commander. +I just think you're wasting your effort.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why do you say that?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I don't think she'll put any serious effort into preparing a present. +At the very most, she'll bring over something childish, or she might even try a prank to make things difficult for me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Would she really do that?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:It might sound strange for me to say this... +But our history of mutual spite can't be resolved so easily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, if it has already gotten to such a point, even I'm starting to feel a little uneasy. +Personally, I don't think Gr MP7 would do something like that. +Like I said before, Gr MP7 might have a difficult personality, but she's not a bad girl.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Hmm... Looks like you place a lot of trust in her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I trust ALL of you.+That includes you too. I believe that none of you are bad people.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:In that case, would you like to make a bet with me, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A bet?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I bet she won't be serious about getting a present for me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I don't think there's a point in betting on that sort of thing.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Don't you trust us all, Commander? +Let's have a bet then; whether your trust in her or her grudge against me comes up on top. +If you win...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I win?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:It's a secret.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's the point then? +Still, I'll accept if just to prove my point. +However, you have to promise me one thing, Honey Badger.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:What is it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You need to put in serious thought when getting Gr MP7 a present, too. +Ultimately, this was all Betty's fault, right? +It would be good if you could give her a proper apology after all this.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:I'll give it some thought. I won't cause trouble for you, Commander. +But if she gives me a hard time, I'm not going to just roll over and take it.
()||:Honey Badger turns and leaves as well.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I hope this turns out well.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>While I understand just how bad their relationship is, there should be a way to fix it as long as there's a good catalyst.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>If Gr MP7 and Honey Badger can both accept this proposition, it'll be a good start.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>As for the rest, all I can do is wait until tonight.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Huh? AA-12? Why are you still here?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +...Wait, so you're saying I could have gone back a while ago?
()||<黑点2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:At night.
()<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Come in.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:... +...Looks like I was the first to arrive. Does that count as a win for me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Those aren't the terms of the contest, are they? +Also, winning isn't the point. Please spare a thought for me.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Winning is probably everything for her.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It seems you're pretty concerned with victory yourself... So, what did you get for her?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Please allow me to keep that a secret for now. +Also, there may not be a chance for me to bring out what I have. +If she doesn't stick to the rules, I don't mind settling the matter in a simpler way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't just challenge her to a duel out of the blue... Still, that's a relief. Does this mean you prepared a proper present?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:But of course. +I'm not like some people who are both childish and unbelievably juvenile.
PDW(2);MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:—Who are you calling "childish and unbelievably juvenile", you dirty rat?!
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:Ah, speak of the devil.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't "childish" and "juvenile" mean the same thing?</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Dammit... All you know how to do is talk behind people's backs. +That's why I hate you.
()||:Gr MP7 looks angry, but she doesn't press the matter further. +In her hands is a medium-sized box, which despite the somewhat crude wrapping, still looks pretty. +Honey Badger seems to notice this as well and is slightly taken aback.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem... +Gr MP7... Do you have a present that'll make Honey Badger speechless?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Hmph, who do you think you're talking to? +Of course I'm going to perfectly fulfill any task I'm given no matter what it is, stupid Caretaker.
()||:This seems to rattle Honey Badger.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:...What the hell? Let me guess, you're buttering me up before you scare me with a prank gift?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She's still being stubborn...</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:A thieving little rat certainly deserves a prank gift, but losing this competition would annoy me more. +And besides...it's Christmas, like Caretaker said. +I don't want to do anything that spoils the mood.
()||:Gr MP7 hands the present over to Honey Badger.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:... +...It's not going to explode if I open it, right?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Of course not! Who the hell do you think I am?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's this?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Hair accessories and silk ribbons. +That stupid rat's been wearing weird clothes since this morning. +So I thought, since it's Christmas, why not give her something to match it? +I made those by hand, so you'd better shed tears of gratitude and thank me, got it?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Ah, those do suit her very well. +So...what about your present, Honey Badger?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:... +...Here.
()||:After a brief period of silence, Honey Badger takes an exquisite box from Betty.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Hmph, well, whatever it is, it still... What IS this?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:It's a lollipop.
PDW(2);MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Huh?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:It's a specially-made Christmas Lollipop. +Betty ate yours this morning, right? +So consider this an apology and stop blaming Betty for it.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:You're...apologizing to me?
()||:Gr MP7 freezes in place. +Honey Badger also looks very uncomfortable and the mood in the air turns awkward.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have you changed your minds now?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:...I was wrong. +You were right, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Even the two of you can understand each other as long as you're willing to communicate. +I'm very glad that you listened to me and got Gr MP7 a present. +You must have put a lot of effort into this.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Well, you were very concerned about things between us, Commander. Even I can feel gratitude for that. +And it's true that I racked my brains for this...although I don't think this is enough to make us friends. +But perhaps it's like you said, Commander. There has to be a first step for everything.
()||:Honey Badger takes out another box.
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Looks like I lost our bet, Commander. Here's my present for you.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For me?
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Yeah. +I need to give it while the mood's still good. +Merry Christmas, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, I can feel the thought you put into this. +...+...Wait a minute.+..."While the mood's still good?" What did you mean by that?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:—Ack.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Gr MP7? What's wrong... Wait, what's with that lollipop?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><震屏3>:Aiiiiiiiiiieeeeeee— It's jumping around! Something's jumping around in my mouth! +Caretaker! It's a bug! A bug's jumping around in my mouth!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down! That's probably not a bug, it's fizzy candy... Honey Badger!
PDW(2)<Speaker>Honey Badger</Speaker>||:Well, I'll be taking my leave then, Commander. +Betty, let's go!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You stop right there!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Shake>||<震屏3>:Noooooo—! It's jumping around so much— Don't bite my mouth!
