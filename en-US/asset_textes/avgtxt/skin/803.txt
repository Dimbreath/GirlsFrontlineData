()||<BIN>79</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:At Griffin's anniversary banquet.
Griffin T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:So what happened with that cat, Miss Mosin-Nagant?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:The T-Dolls at our dorm are looking after it!+You're welcome to come by and visit whenever you have the time.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Celebrity</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:May I have the honor of a dance, Miss?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ah...+Of course, it would be my honor.
M1891(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏1>:......
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>:When the background music changed to a more cheerful tune, I heard a burst of bright laughter.+I couldn't help but laugh a bit myself, as I knew that laughter was from Mosin-Nagant.+She seems to have a magical power that entrances and enlivens those around her, and makes those people want to interact with her.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:"How nice it is that cheerful people are popular everywhere."+With that thought in mind, I head over to greet Mosin-Nagant as the music track ends.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ah, Commander.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:You're great at dancing.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Haha, you saw?+Thank you for the compliment.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:So, are you having fun?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yeah, I'd say I enjoy venues with a lot of people.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:That's good.+...Eh? The glass of wine in your hand... Seems like you haven't drank much from it.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:This? Ah, yes.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Comrade Mosin-Nagant that loves alcohol isn't drinking?+So you're not actually having fun at all!
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:No, that's not it... It's not necessary to drink that much at a banquet like this.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Not...necessary?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:The company's image is more important.+Besides, I think these people would prefer a lady over a drunk.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Comrade Mosin-Nagant is actually reliable in these sorts of situations?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:What are you talking about, Comrade Commander? I've always been reliable!
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Alright, alright.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:As for relaxing and being myself or whatever, I can do that at the party tonight~+By the way Comrade Commander, do you want to get drunk with me tonight?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点1>:Oh...I can't. Drink with everyone else.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At Griffin's internal party.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hearing a hearty laughter, there is no doubt in my mind that it is Mosin-Nagant...+...I thought to myself as the source of this laughter walks closer and closer.+I slowly turn around, trying to keep my smile from looking too stiff.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Um...Comrade Mosin-Nagant, Kalina still has work for me to deal with...
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏>:Come on, don't be in such a hurry!+Didn't you promise to drink with me~?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:When did I make that promise!+...Can I get back the Mosin-Nagant from the banquet earlier?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:No can do~ I've turned off the proper lady mode~♪+Now it's the big sister Mosin-Nagant mode!♪
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Then I'll drink a little bit... Just a little bit!
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Comrade Commander, you're killing the mood...
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Eh? R-really?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:We rarely get a chance to have such a gre~at party~+Don't be so uptight~
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You really look like you're having fun.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:But of course. I've waited for this party for a whole day!+Are you not happy with the party, Commander?
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Of course I'm happy.+I've been looking forward to this party myself as well.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Yet, you're still as composed as ever...+Hehe, here, finish up this bottle for me.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Just a little bit, okay?+(I still have work to do! I can't get drunk now!)
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:Hahahaha!+Commander, to victory in a brand new year, cheers!
M1891(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:...A moment later, Mosin-Nagant becomes visibly wobbly.+She is holding onto the Commander's shoulder giggling like a drunk buffoon.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Sigh) She's drunk again...
HK416(4)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Commander, so you're he-... Do you need help?
HK416(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh, 416!+Perfect timing! Help...! (Small voice)
HK416(4)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Understood.
HK416(4);M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Slurred words) 416, have some booze! ......
HK416(4)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Sure. Stop singing first and I'll drink.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:416 takes Mosin-Nagant away while she tries to coax 416 into drinking with her. "She's hopeless." I amusingly thought to myself as I wiped the sweat from my forehead.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:I couldn't help but think...+Isn't she revealing a bit too much of her true self...?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:But then again, it is indeed a rare chance for them to have an event like this. Perhaps I am being a bit too uptight.+Not to mention, perhaps only a venue like this can allow them to act out their true selves, and it is only because they trust me that I am allowed to see this side of them...+I suppose this also proves that I've been a good commander.+Maybe the next time we celebrate, I can trust them and involve myself a little more. Maybe...+But for now, I'll leave them to celebrate for victory in a brand new year.
