IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><震屏>:Commeownder! This is super delicious! You need to try it!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><震屏>:Wow, Commeownder! These lights are soooo shiny~
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><震屏>:Commeownder, Commeownder! Look at him! Look at him!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Woooooooow, Commeownderrrrrrrr!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(Interrupts) Ahem, IDW.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Meow?
IDW(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I feign nonchalance as I quickly look around. Thank goodness IDW's screeching hasn't caught the attention of anybody yet.
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(This girl is...very distinctive...in more ways than one.)
IDW(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:IDW is a little different from usual tonight. Despite the little tiara on her head, she does not seem very much like a noble princess, especially when she opens her mouth.
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(She really needs to be more attentive. Her shawl's even sliding off of her arm...)
IDW(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Pivoting her head all around, IDW gawks at anything that catches her attention, paying no mind to her own inelegant behavior at all.
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I must say, you seem a bit too excited.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ehhh? Am I?
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:This is your first time at a cocktail party, isn't it, IDW?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yup!+It's so much fun! Do you often come to these parties, Commeownder? I'm having a blast!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Well, not that often.+Still, don't get too carried away. Don't forget, we're on a mission.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:But of course!+A chance like this is sooooo hard to come by! I'm gonna put my best foot forward!+So don't worry, Commeownder! I'm a professional bodyguard!☆
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:...Alright.+In any case, you need to behave. I'm going to look around outside for a bit, so I'll leave the party hall to you guys.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Mhm mhm!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点1>:(I guess she should be fine.)
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(But things might get...interesting...if her opponent is that Doll.)
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:I watch the number of guests steadily increase as I surreptitiously slip out of the party.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Half an hour later.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:There sure are a lot of people...+I should grab a couple more snacks before the Commeownder comes back♪+Do phantom thieves or whatever really exist? I really wonder...+Whatever, that question isn't important. Even if they do exist, I'll beat them within the snap of a--
()||<BIN>79</BIN><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:Whoom~ whoom~
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:The alarm suddenly goes off.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:What's going on!?+I know this sound! It's...+Huh...what was it again?
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:Frightened by the alarm, someone within the crowd of guests yells, "There's a fire! Run!", and the hall immediately descends into chaos.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><震屏><黑点1>:Aha! That's it! It's the fire alarm! There's a fire!+No wait, now's not the time to be pleased with my acuity. I need to help evacuate the crowd!+Ah...um, everyone, don't panic!+Please exit in an orderly manner! Exit in an orderly manner! There are people outside waiting to help you!+Hey! Did you hear me? Exit in an orderly manner!
()||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点2>:Thanks to the combined efforts of IDW and the venue staff, the guests are quickly evacuated.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Whew...looks like that's all of them.+Still, I wonder, how did the fire start?
IDW(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Thud! Thud!+Lost in thought, IDW does not hear the noises behind her.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Speaking of which, I didn't see any fire or smoke, so why...+...!
IDW(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><震屏><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1><SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Bang!+Suddenly, a bullet streaks past the tip of IDW's hair. IDW instinctively evades and returns fire.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:You...you're...
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Whew, you have frightening combat reflexes.+Unfortunately, your ability to multitask is nowhere as good as everyone else.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You, why is it you! Just now...you you you-
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2>:Yes, yes, I know what you want to say.
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:SAA proudly plants her hands on her hips. She is surrounded by the tranquilized bodies of the security guards.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:How how how come you're the phantom thief!+(Loud) Are you here to steal the jewel!?+(Really loud) Ahhhhhhh! How could this be!+(Really really loud) Where's the Commeownder? Does the Commeownder know!?
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><震屏>:Ahhh, you're so damn noisy!+I should've knocked you out with that shot just now and shut you up!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Don't. Even. Think. About. It!+I have no idea what's going on, but I'm the Commeownder's ace bodyguard!+Doesn't matter who's got their eyes on the jewel - I won't let it happen!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Yaho~ you talk pretty big. Stop me if you can~
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Ignoring IDW, SAA begins walking toward the jewel.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Wait wait wait wait!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:As if anyone would listen to you.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:I forbid you from taking the jewel!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:(Hums a tune) ♪
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><震屏><BGM>BGM_Pause</BGM><黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:A duel!+I-I challenge you to a duel!
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_UnPause</BGM>:(Stops) Oh?+A duel?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hehe, got your attention, did I?+That's right, a duel!+If you lose, you leave right away and abandon all your plans for that jewel!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:And what if you lose?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Uuu...+If I lose...then you can take the jewel... (Her voice trails off)
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:That's what I would have done anyway!+How about this? If you lose, you'll have to shut up for an hour.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Fine! Whatever!+But! But! I will never lose to you!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You talk very big indeed~+Alright, then state the terms of the duel.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Then we'll...
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Aha, I know!+Let's have a quick draw showdown, you know, like cowboys!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hey! Who said you can decide on that by yourself!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Well, if you don't want to, then that's too bad. (Pretends to walk)
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Wait wait wait wait!+All right...I'll do it!+And I'm raising the stakes! One crate of cola! I'll bet one crate of cola!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:!+One...crate...of...cola!+Are you sure? I recorded that.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Of course I'm sure!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点1>:Yaho~+Bring it!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+The battle ends.
()||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2>:IDW collapses between SAA and the jewel. She glares at SAA with a disgruntled expression on her face.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You're a hundred years too early to even dream of beating me in a duel like this♪
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Uuu...+You're too mean meow...+I thought we were just going to draw our guns and shoot! You used your skill!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hmph, you didn't say I couldn't, now did you?+A duel must be treated as a life-or-death battle!+You could say that you lost because you took it too lightly.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Uuu...
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Alright, alright, stay here and reflect on what you did wrong.+I, on the other hand, will be taking the jewel, and then helping myself to the cola in your room!+W-Wait a minute! Where's the jewel!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Haha, you didn't expect that, did you?+My teammate already took the jewel while you were busy facing me!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I see...+So it was just a diversion to delay me. I see, I see.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Exactly ~meow!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hmph, I have to say, I didn't expect you to use your brain like that.+Did you go to some kind of personal success course to learn to promote yourself?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:You're too mean! I have many selling points... (Distinct lack of confidence)+But there's one thing I don't understand. Why are you stealing the jewel?
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...It's just a mission.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:A mission? Meowmeowmeow?
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:All you need to know is that I'm not at odds with the Commander.+In any case, I won the duel.+I'll be going back for some cola now since there's nothing else for me to do here.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Are you just leaving like this, SAA?
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Mhm. See ya later.+Oh yes, if you don't have a crate of cola in your dorm, I'll make up the difference by ordering it through logistics.+And then I'll sign your name to it, got it?♪
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;M1873(4)||<BIN>139</BIN>:Uuuu! You're so mean!
IDW(2);M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点1>:Ahhhh, you're so loud!+You lost fair and square, so shut up already!
()||<BIN>18</BIN><黑点2><Night>:An hour later. +In the corridors of the Griffin base.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Ahhh, Commeownder!+Long time no see!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Heh...it's only been a few hours.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Uuu, you don't know how mean SAA has been to me!+It's been a very long hour!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:I-I see...+So how did the mission go?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:I lost a duel with SAA...+But I managed to delay her while Grizzly and the others moved the jewel elsewhere!+Not a bad way to complete the mission, I'd say!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Oh? You seem to be in higher spirits than I expected.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Meow?
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:It was unfortunate that I couldn't let you join the party...+I mean, it's not every day that you get to wear such a beautiful dress.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:Only now that I realize I hadn't praised her when I saw her earlier today.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑屏2>2.5</黑屏2>:Really? Really?+Commeownder, do I really look pretty today?
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Yes, definitely.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Ehe♪+I'm happy enough to receive your praise!+I feel super happy wearing something completely different from my usual outfit!+Say, Commeownder...
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Hm?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Can I...keep this dress?
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Of course. Treat it as the payment for this mission.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Wahhhhahaha! Awesome!+I'm 8127% happy today!
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Why that number in particular?
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:10000 is the max, minus 1873!+Mhm, I'll beat her next time!+(Mutters) But I still don't get what SAA meant by her mission...
IDW(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night>:Hah, you're sure fired up, IDW.+Keep up the good work. You'll be able to do it someday!
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:Yup yup!+Commeownder, Commeownder!+I will beat her someday meow!
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:Her spirited declaration echoes down the long corridor, reverberating through the Griffin base and the neural clouds of every T-Doll within range.
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Uuugh...+Just as I thought, an hour was not enough at all!
