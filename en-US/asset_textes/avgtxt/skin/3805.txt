Shouldn't we get along?"+"Hehe, relax, I simply want to take part in your antics for once."+...+"Good morning, O Chosen One."
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><睁眼><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:It seems my slumber has persisted too long. How far has the world turned?+I thought I had engraved the phantasms I just saw into my mind, but they faded and scattered with the opening of my eyes. Is this the nature of dreams, or are memories as ephemeral as smoke... +In that case, tell me, oh Chronicler. What time is it now?
FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Ding dong— I have been summoned by the great Lady KSVK! The time now is 19:03 pm!
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,200</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:...I have tarried far longer than I expected. I must move now for the sake of the destined gathering. +I will face the oncoming storm in perfect form.
FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Go go, Lady KSVK, go!
FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>;KSVK(0)||<震屏>:Are you awake yet, KSVK?!+Hurry and open up if you are, I've been waiting a long time for you!
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:The aperture never bars those who wish to enter. If you draw near with the purpose to visit, then...
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>||:It's not locked, right? Then I'm coming in.
KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Uh, hold...
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:...What are you doing?
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:As you can see, I am preparing for tonight's festivities.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Tonight's festivities? Is something going on tonight?
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Have you not heard? Tonight's main event is a feast that ignites the fears of all and serves them up for the enjoyment of the masses.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Ah, you mean the test of courage? That was last night, have you gone stupid from oversleeping?
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:...Last night?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Yes, XM8's been hanging from the café entrance all day. +From what I heard, Gr G36 was really mad and wouldn't listen to anyone until the Commander pleaded with her to let XM8 down.
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:She was not a guest tonight... I mean, last night.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Who knows? Apparently she tricked Gr G36c into taking her clothes off.
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:So, o unexpected guest, would you care to explain the reason for your arrival?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Ah, yes, you really pulled a fast one on me yesterday!
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I do not recall encountering you, whether in the corridor, in the main hall, or in any location our feet could have taken us.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Cut the crap! I recorded what you told me! + "Those who never give anything will never receive anything. There is no escaping this principle during tonight's activities. Among the prizes which this year's organizers have furnished is a 20%-off discount coupon, valid at all supermarkets."
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:It did sound like something I would say, and it was indeed my voice. But I have no recollection of this... +And my internal clock states that today is Halloween.
FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>;KSVK(5)||:Lady KSVK! Lady KSVK! Halloween was yesterday!
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:See, even your...what is that, anyway? An abandoned Fairy?
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:It is a broken Fairy. At least when it is with me, it can still contribute its remaining vigor as an alarm clock.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Alright, then your Fairy alarm clock knows the date better than you do. +Honestly, how clueless can someone be...
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Do you have a complete record of everything which transpired yesterday in your neural cloud?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||:Of course. I know everything, from how you tricked me to how you stuffed M870 into a pumpkin.
QBU88(0);KSVK(5)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:From unclear transmission do errors spring, QBU-88.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(5)||<黑点1>:...Fine, I'll explain everything to you, but you'd better listen! And let me get this out of the way first, I'm not sure about the rest.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:KSVK listens to QBU-88's narration as she gets dressed.
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:The "me" that you describe is like the half-moon, veiled in shadow.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:So you're saying that you have a split personality?
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:There is no point in denying it; we must face reality head-on.+But there is no falsehood in what I am telling you now.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Er...um...you don't look like you're lying either.+I'll believe you, then! But surely the KSVK that everyone saw wasn't a fake, right? Nobody could tell that something was wrong with her. +Also, when I was engaged in a transmission with that "you", the background was also...
QBU88(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:QBU-88 turns back and suddenly freezes.+KSVK follows her gaze and finds a Dummy leaning against the wall in the corridor.+There is still some dust on it, suggesting that it's been out and about before this.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:...You were standing in that spot when you sent me that transmission yesterday.
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Things are becoming more and more intriguing now... I took leave of my senses, dreamed a dream that was not my own...and even went so far as to sleepwalk within it?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker><Shake>;KSVK(0)||:P-perhaps? This is starting to sound like a ghost story, but Halloween's over, isn't it?
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Though we stand in light, the truth is hidden in the mists, is it... Let me check her records.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><回忆>:This is it! Thank you, Welrod. We couldn't have brought KSVK here without you. Thanks!
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkII/Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:It is simply what I should have done.
Welrod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Welrod drags KSVK onto the bed before leaving with Kalina.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:After a while, the camera angle shifts.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:Startup complete.+Humph...I can't believe hacking into a piece of trash like this without being detected would be so troublesome.+In any case, let's give the control systems a try.
KSVK(4);FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Good morning, my lady! Happy Halloween!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,200</Position>||:What is this...a drone? It's even less sophisticated than a Dinergate... Oh, Halloween, is it? +So Griffin celebrates such an event...
KSVK(4);FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:I was recovered and rebuilt into an alarm clock! Celebrate! Celebrate! Your clothes are ready, you must celebrate!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,200</Position>||:And there are even specially prepared clothes... +Hey, what's going on tonight?
KSVK(4);FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:The Test of Courage! You're the host; you're going to heat things up!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,200</Position>||:Heat things up...an excellent idea. +I'll set the place on fire with this body, then. It'll be a grand fireworks display.+...Hm?+So this body has a shred of self-awareness despite being a Dummy? It has a will that's resisting me. How interesting.
KSVK(4);FairyTaunt(0)<Speaker>Alarm Clock</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Danger, fire! Danger, fire!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,200</Position>||<黑屏1>:Now then, let's try something else.+You gave me a hard time, so don't expect to get off easily.+Let's have a look at the data in your main unit...
KSVK(4)||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2><回忆>:The transmission goes through.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:Is that QBU-88? +There is something you might covet in tonight's festivities.
KSVK(4);QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Festivals like these don't mean anything to me. I'm not interested in celebrating them.</color>
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>;QBU88(0)||:A 20%-off discount coupon.

KSVK(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The camera moves again, and the point of view leaves the dorm area. + ...
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN><关闭蒙版><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What a bizarre tale... +This is not so much the dark side of the moon, but more like being invaded by a different shade of light.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker><Shake>;KSVK(0)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...It's cold.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:<color=#FF0000>You should be glad. Being able to feel the cold is proof that you're still alive.</color>
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Are you still recalling your previous experiences?
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Phew... What on earth WAS that? It was like you were possessed. Still, that tone sounded really familiar. +That's...yes, that's it!
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:An enemy we've been fighting all this time...
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#FF0000>Your judgment is correct.</color>
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Who's saying that I was right? ...Is it Sangvis Ferri?+It can't be. Even if the Dummy was infected by the Parapluie or whatever virus, it wouldn't be dumb enough to run around inside a Griffin base, right?
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:That would not be a wise choice. A proper hunter would choose silence, until the moment comes to bring down their prey.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Then what could it be...a Dummy running out of control? +Or a bug in our programming?
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:That guess might be the closest to the truth.
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:But it's just weird! It makes no sense!+Why did she do this? She obtained freedom after so much effort, but all she did was pull pranks...? Shouldn't she have run away?
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Perhaps she simply had nowhere to go. +Like a lost child, or a prey being harried into a corner...
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Or maybe she came back because she ran out of power. +When you put it that way, does it mean that even right now, she's... Just the thought sends a chill down my spine.
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#FF0000>That is really offensive.</color>
QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Well, there's no need to be scared, it's just the Dummy talking. It'll be fine as long as it doesn't move.
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It may be displeasing, but we would naturally have arrived at that conclusion anyway. I have a feeling that we are getting closer to the truth within the confusion...
QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#FF0000>The truth? You see this as the truth?</color>+<color=#FF0000>A riddle of this grade is nothing more than child's play. And you're calling it the truth? Don't make me laugh.</color>

QBU88(0)<Speaker>QBU-88</Speaker>;KSVK(0)||:Huh?

QBU88(0);KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker><Shake>||:Me?
