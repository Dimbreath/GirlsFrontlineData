()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Griffin Control.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Understood, Commander.+So the wedding dress shoot will be a publicity stunt for Griffin and IOP... It looks like this will be quite interesting.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You seem to be very excited...
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Surprised?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I didn't think Tactical Dolls would be interested in this sort of work.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:We're still girls outside of combat, you know.+And as company employees, we don't exactly have a choice in the missions we take on, do we?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...You do have a point.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Oh, by the way...could you clarify a small detail of the mission for me, Commander?+Has the client specified what we'll wear for the shoot?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah...you can pick anything from the dress store.+They didn't specify any particular styles, so that part is up to us.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Then how about I assist you in picking out the dresses, Commander?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Sure thing. I'm not too sure on what kind of clothing everyone likes.+I'm sure that you'd understand a Doll's interest better than I do, Five-seven.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:But of course. I'm quite confident in my judgement.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:We'll be picking out the dresses the day after tomorrow.+I'll be counting on you, Five-seven.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:You got it, Commander.+I'll be sure to pick out the most fabulous dresses for everyone.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2>:Two days later.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:Five-seven and I are at the photo studio building, picking out the outfits for everyone.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:We've already been here for three hours...+I didn't expect it to take this long... My eyeballs are so dry they're shrivelling up into raisins.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:It is the outfit for the most important day of a person's life, after all.+Since we're only doing it for an ad shoot, we only need to pick out one dress.+If it's a real wedding then we'd need five different outfits per person according to this studio's policy.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You sure know a lot about this, don't you?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I simply did a little bit of research.+You've got to do your homework before carrying out your mission.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Guess I've underestimated the difficulty here.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Don't worry, we're almost done.+These are my final choices, Commander, what do you think?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Let see...+Hm, these look fine. I have no objections.+Your help is much appreciated, Five-seven. You've got a real eye for elegance.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hehe, I'm the best at what I do.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:But it seems like...we're missing one.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Mine isn't here.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Huh?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I want to surprise you on the day of the shoot.+Can you leave mine out of the inspection?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh...alright. I look forward to it.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:Thanks! I promise you won't regret it!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The day of the photo shoot.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Commander...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Commander, wake up...+It's time to wake up!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><睁眼>:Ugh...ah?!+...Five-seven?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I rub my sleepy eyes to see a girl in a pure white dress standing before me.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:It's me, Commander.+How can you sleep in a place like this? You'll catch a cold.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Sorry...I was up too early today.+Is the sun up?
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:The sun is up and shining bright, Commander.+While it pains me to wake you up when you haven't gotten enough sleep...+The makeup process takes a long time, so please bear with it for today.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Haha, that's alright.+I'm already used it since we don't get regular sleep on battle missions, anyway...+Where are the others?
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:They're still putting on makeup. I'm the first one to finish.+I made some preparations last night to speed up the process so I would be the first one out.+As promised, here's my wedding dress that I wanted to show off to you first.+So what do you think, Commander?
FN57(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:It's very beautiful... It definitely suits you.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hehe, my eye's never mistaken. Now then, Commander... Would you like to watch my photo shoot?+It'll be a while before the others are done.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Sure, I've never seen a person take wedding photos before.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Never, huh... That's perfect...
FN57(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What are you mumbling about, Five-seven?
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点1>:Nothing, Commander.+This will be a feast for your eyes~
()||<BIN>136</BIN><黑点2>:At the photo studio room.
()||<BIN>136</BIN>:I silently observe the shooting process.
摄影师()<Speaker>Photographer</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Miss, please raise your head a little bit more.
FN57(2)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Like this?
FN57(2)<Speaker>Photographer</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Look further out into the distance...toward your colleague over there.+Yes, perfect! Keep that pose!
FN57(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Five-seven looks at me with a smile brimming with joy and confidence.+I could not help but feel my heart stir as our eyes meet.+This scene is beautiful enough; there's no need to verify it through the lens to know that it is a flawless work of art.+In this very moment, Five-seven looks just like a flower blossoming proudly as it faces the sun.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:“Hide a flower in a flower field," as they say...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><黑屏1>:The blooming flowers are no less beautiful than the hidden flower.+And so, today's mission begins amidst the morning sunlight.+I sincerely hope today will be a quiet and peaceful day.
