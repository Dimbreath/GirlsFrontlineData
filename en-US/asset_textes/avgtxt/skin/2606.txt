()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:...Several days before Halloween.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...In the dorms.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Halloween is almost here. S.A.T.8 has been running back and forth over the past few days in order to prepare for the ghost story-telling competition. +After S.A.T.8 comes back at night to rest in the dorm, she happens to see F1 writing something.
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:My, still awake, F1?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Huh? Oh...
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<震屏>:Aw, you derailed my train of thought! +Honestly... it gets harder to write anything the closer I get to the deadline...
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Your deadline? What's that? It sounds pretty dangerous...
SAT8(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:No, it's nothing. +Speaking of which, how are your preparations? The event is gonna happen soon, right?
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>;F1(0)||:Things are pretty much settled! I've already filed requests for the venue and the supplies, so now all we need to do is wait for Halloween to come! +Although, I'm still not sure if keeping everything secret from the Commander is the right thing to do...
SAT8(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Well...I'm not sure about that either. +Still, I bet the Commander learned about this long ago. I won't find it surprising if the Commander shows up all of a sudden while we're telling ghost stories, you know?
SAT8(0)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>;F1(0)||:That...that's possible... +Although... I don't know if making such an entrance is a good thing or not...
SAT8(0);F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Haha, well, if you ask me, getting bashed up would be bad, right? Good luck!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +On Halloween.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In an old warehouse.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 is struggling to operate the warehouse's equipment terminal.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Should I say this was what I expected of an old warehouse...? These things are all antiques. Which era did they even come from? I can't make head or tail of them! +Honestly, if I'd known earlier, I would have simplified my poem anthology some more. As things stand now, typing them all in is a pain in the ass.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Still...if S.A.T.8 and the others finish telling their ghost stories and the Commander hasn't shown up yet, I guess I'll call the Commander over. +After all, I don't usually have any good gifts for the Commander...
AR(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(0)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:(Distant voice) Huh? Is there someone in the warehouse? Helloooo?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Jumps) Crap, is that the Commander? Surprises are surprises because people don't know about them beforehand! +Just...just a little more... Alright! c'mon, gotta turn it off—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander enters the old warehouse.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, if it isn't F1. +What are you doing in an old warehouse like this? I hope you're not preparing to prank people behind my back.
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Sighs heavily) Don't be ridiculous. +I just came here in search of inspiration!
F1(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, that's right, you've always been writing poems. (Mutters) Though you've never shown me any of them...
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Ah...
F1(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem. Speaking of which, it's Halloween, so aren't you going to get some new clothes, F1?
F1(0)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:That stuff isn't really important. +Also, I don't want to be like the others...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Several hours later... +F1 ends up sucked into cyberspace due to sudden developments during the event...
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I said it wasn't important, but...
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<震屏>:I ended up changing my outfit in the end! +Dammit! So much for my strength of character! +This isn't romantic at all! Always defaulting to this sort of thing isn't good!
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 carries on her inner monologue as she walks through the cyberspace, all alone.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:What on earth is going on here... +They were all telling ghost stories just now, and S.A.T.8 was so frightened that she nearly burst into tears! +And then...and then there was a ray of white light, and I think everyone got sucked into some kind of hole?
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 looks around, and what she sees confirms the fact that she is all by herself.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:In any case, let's just keep moving.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...Five minutes later.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:The place we were sucked into... should still be within Griffin base ... right? +(Beat) Wait a minute, don't tell me this is cyberspace?
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 checks her communicator. There is some static, but it's definitely still working.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Hello, hello. is anyone online? This is F1, I'm currently in a...hm, a forest. +If anyone can hear me, please guide me to meet up with everyone, over!
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:After shouting into the communicator, F1 ends the transmission and looks around.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I haven't taken part in many electronic battles either. What a pain. +Still, while the scenery in most digital training areas tends to vary, this place is actually...pretty nice.
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Surprisingly enough, F1 finds many strange and bizarre sights in this place. +Skyscrapers sit side by side with forests, and cyberspace rippling beside ruined battlefields. +There is even a beach.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:This is just wrong, no matter how you look at it... I mean, there's a city and a forest and a beach existing side by side.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as F1 is busy being surprised by the sights in the cyberspace, her communicator rings. +F1 taps it to turn on the transmission, and she sees the images of two people.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just calm down and stay where you are. We'll keep in touch.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I need to locate the others' signals first.</color>
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, you're the only one who can sort this out... Please find the others.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Beep.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Shake>||:Er... Hang on— +Wait, the transmission...ended? +Don't tell me... We've all been scattered into different digital realms?+I can be sure that TAC and MDR are still alive, at least, and that they're searching for me and the others...
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Hm... Am I seeing this because this is a digital world, so the data and radio waves here are all on the same bandwidth? +Hmm! It IS cyberspace, after all! All this scenery and the crossed signals are in cyberspace! +At the very least I don't need to worry about my safety any more.  I'll just treat this as a good experience and go adventuring to come up with a new poem!
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1's spirits rise again with the thought. She takes her tactical tablet in hand and rides her broom forward.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Not bad! Even this decorative broom can fly! It is a digital world, after all!+<color=#ADFF2F>Little F1~ Soaring on her broom~ Looking brave and cool!☆</color>+Mm mm! Good, good! What bizarre scenery this is!
F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just as F1 is carefully studying the scenery, she senses something strange.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Hmm? +For some reason...
AR(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Have we been forgotten? Have we been forgotten?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Shake>||:Who-who's that?!
()||:A very quiet voice suddenly speaks up, but it is clear enough for F1 to hear. +F1 stops her broom's flight and looks around warily.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So we've been forgotten. So we've been forgotten.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:You're...who are you?
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:We are the fragments of the digital world.+We are the fragments of the scenery, and of these poems.+Have we been forgotten? Have the fairies of the poem been forgotten?
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(They keep talking about being forgotten... Did someone important forget them?)</color>
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position><Grey>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position><Grey>||:
()||:There seems to be something among the shadows of the trees.+It is tiny, almost ephemeral, yet there is definitely something there.
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Forgotten. The most important thing was forgotten.
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Is she waiting for someone...?)</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>(But I seem to be the only person in this place.)</color>
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Shake>||<黑点1>:Ummm...how about this?! This is Halloween candy. I was going to give it to the Commander after the event, but I'll give it to you guys first. I've still got a lot! +I mean, you're waiting for someone, right? It would be bad if you went hungry while waiting. +I'm going to continue looking for inspiration! See you, little fairies!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:... +F1 bids the fairies farewell, but the strange feeling grows within her, consuming her neural cloud.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:For some reason...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>137</BIN><黑点2>:F1 passes through a stretch of trees.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:All of these...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑点2>:F1 stands before a ruined battlefield.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Feel like places...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑点2>:F1 treads through wave after wave at the seaside, looking at the unrealistically blue sky of this digital world.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:...That I've visited before! +It really brings back memories. I didn't think that I'd been through so much war and experienced so much joy and sorrow. + (Pauses) Forgotten... Did they mean that I'd forgotten these scenes?
AR(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:You still don't remember. Still don't remember.
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position><Grey>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position><Grey>||:
()||:At some point, the tiny fairies have gathered around F1 again.
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:What a disappointment... So they're all sights I've seen before, how boring... +How am I supposed to write a new poem now!
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Why do you write poems? +Why do you write poems?
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:It's because I love it, of course! +I may be small, but I'm a poet! +Although nobody really reads the poems I write, and I've never shown them to the Commander before...
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Then. +Why are you going on an adventure?
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:To write a new poem, of course! +—Ehhhh?
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Do you remember? Do you remember?
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:In the first place... I went on adventures because I liked them... +Are you trying to tell me that this is what I've forgotten?
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Do you remember? Do you remember?
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position><Grey>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position><Grey>||:
()||:F1 sits down by the beach and hugs her knees.
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:Now that I think about it... It seems like for a very long time, I went adventuring just for the sake of creating new work... +But I really do like being creative, and I also like adventuring very much, so I was always excited every time I went out on missions! +After all, they were all new and precious experiences! +Because I'm not just a poet, but a bona fide explorer too.
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:You remembered♪ +You remembered it all♪
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:I'm not like the elite Dolls at the base who keep pondering the meaning of their existence... I wouldn't be able to figure that out no matter how hard I thought about it. +Hm...to me, it's just that I want to know about everything in the world, and I want to write them all down with my own hands. Who knows, perhaps far in the future, someone will pass on my poems! +I don't want to let the two things I love so much become fixed rules, like how we need new outfits at Halloween...
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Writing is joyful♪ +Adventuring is joyful too♪
AR(0)<Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker><Position>-450,0</Position>||:You guys were right... +I lost my way... Yeah! Thank you all! It feels like my thoughts and vision have suddenly opened up! +That's how it should be after all. I'm happiest when I want to write poems and understand this world!
AR(0);F1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 is about to continue her happy conversation with the fairies when several rays of unusual light suddenly shoot out of the sky in the cyberspace.
AR(0)<Speaker>Fairy</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;F1(2)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:Are you going back? You have to go back.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm? I suppose that means...my friends from the base have come to take me home... +In any case, this was a rare opportunity. It seems all this was the physical incarnation of my anthology. +Though the scenery was familiar, I'm grateful to you for letting me experience something new! +It's truly farewell this time! Goodbye, little fairies...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Late at night, after the incident is wrapped up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>87</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:At the Griffin Café.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just like the previous Halloweens, I finally drag my tired body into the Café.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this some kind of curse... Am I doomed to run into some spooky stuff every Halloween... +—Huh? Is that F1?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In the distance, I see F1 sitting at the counter. She looks like she's writing something. +After F1 sees me, she waves to me and pats the seat beside her.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you dressed up as a little witch for Halloween this year. +—Didn't you say this sort of thing wasn't important?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Humph, you've been dying to say that, haven't you?
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nope. +So, what have you been writing all this time, F1? I know you've always been writing poems, but I've only seen a few lines of them.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Hmm... Well, about that, there was originally a good chance tonight for you to appreciate my poetry, Commander.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Eh? Am I really that lucky?! +—Wait a minute, did you say "originally"?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Yup. +Which is to say, you've already missed that good chance.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But-but I don't even know what happened... +Dammit!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:F1 covers her mouth and giggles.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't you think it's a shame, F1?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, if you ask me... +Most people would want their creations to be seen by others, right?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I do want everyone to read and understand the poems I write.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Excited) Really? Then you can come show them to me anytime!
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Laughs) Hmm~ nope. +For starters, there needs to be a sense of formality about the whole thing. +Besides, I'm not really that broken up over the fact that you missed this chance. After all, there'll be others; splendid, shining, one-in-a-million chances!
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's really mature of you, F1. +Quite a few of the girls on the base would be bawling if they knew they'd missed their chance...
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:Perhaps... But perhaps that's also because I feel that some things aren't really that important.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:I found an answer tonight, and it was a way out of something that had started bothering me before I realized it.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sounds like a good thing.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:It is! +I think the most important thing is the feelings I have when I write my verse. Even if I can't share them with you, Commander, they have most definitely existed. +And I know that they will always exist, in different ways... I won't forget those moments.
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It sounds like you went through something very interesting and important tonight.
F1(2)<Speaker>F1</Speaker>||:(Laughs) It is Halloween, after all, so anything can happen, right?
F1(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes...it is Halloween, after all...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1>:... +In the end, F1 never showed me the poem she was writing, even after Halloween ended. +While I personally feel it was a shame, it also means that I'm looking forward to the next "one-in-a-million chance".
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:F1 seems even more independent after that. At the same time, she also grows happier and happier every day. +I don't know if I'm just imagining things, but I suppose it's a good thing...
