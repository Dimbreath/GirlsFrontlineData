4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:I hadn't meant to deceive thou, Commander! +We were threatened, and forced into this...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Please, forgive our slight! +Waaah, please don't rip our fire-control core out of us!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:The coal mines?! No, not the dastardly coal mines!!! +Waah... please, we don't want to be sent there...

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Is something troubling you, 4 Shiki? Why are you spacing out here?
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<立绘震动>:Ah! Commander...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:W-We're preparing for the upcoming operation! +It's our first time going on a mission near the sea... +It's oddly nerve-wracking, haha... <c>Don't worry, I've planned for everything. <c>Don't be nervous, I'm here.
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Aye! I have only the greatest amount of faith in thee!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:O-Oh, we understand! +(Our neural cloud seems to be overheating a bit...)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Carry on with your preparations. I'll go and check up on the others.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Ugh... +Our Commander can't be this cute...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<震屏>:Oh, crud! +We...still couldn't tell the Commander the truth... +This shan't do! We've to come clean with our honored Commander!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But... +If this operation gets canceled, we won't have the inspiration to draw the next arc for our manga... +Our deadline is fast approaching. If we don't submit our manuscript soon, our editor will...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><回忆><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>Hustling Editor</Speaker>||<震屏>:What?!! +No inspiration?! Is that your excuse for not making your deadline? +Good grief... At least give me a more convincing reason! +We editors have it hard too, you know...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Our greatest apologies! +But we really haven't any inspiration at all... +We haven't had any opportunity to go on a mission within yesteryear...
()<Speaker>Hustling Editor</Speaker>||:If you don't have any inspiration, then create it yourself. +Rules are dead set in stone, but humans are alive and flexible! +Oh sorry, I forgot you're a Doll... +Right, here's what you can do!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<震屏>:What?!!! +You want us to deceive our Commander with a fabricated mission?! +Nay! We could never betray thy Commander!
()<Speaker>Hustling Editor</Speaker>||:Don't you guys have a Griffin forum? +Just post a thread anonymously and the Commander won't know it's your doing.
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Nay, no way! +We can't do that!
()<Speaker>Hustling Editor</Speaker>||:(Smiles deviously) +In that case, your cute Commander will find out tomorrow... +Who's behind the very popular shoujo manga with the Commander as the protagonist... +Oh right, this Commander actually left us a comment asking about the author's identity...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Y-You! +You'd sworn you'd never expose us!
()<Speaker>Hustling Editor</Speaker>||<黑点1>:If you don't want your secret identity revealed, you'd better go and get some inspiration.♪ +Here, I've even written the forum post for you. +Make the topic "Viral Mermaid Sighting" or something, hahaha...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Not only will our editor sell me out... +If we tell the truth, the furious Commander may even have our fire-control core dismantled on the spot... +Then send us to the coal mines...
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:And whilst we're within those dark mines... +We won't ever see the Commander again, nor will there ever be any new chapters for our manga thenceforth!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<size=50>NoooooooooOOOooooOOoo!!!</size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:4 Shiki? Report to the rally point now! We're about to set off!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Roger! We're coming, post-haste!
4type(0)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We... +We've wronged the Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Alright, now split into your pre-arranged groups and carry out your respective missions! +It's a relatively easy operation this time – all you have to do is search for any clues about mermaids in this area of the sea. +Prioritize your own safety and head towards your designated locations. +Remember to report to me from time to time.
()<Speaker>Mermaid Operation Teams</Speaker>||:Understood!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yay! We get to observe the Commander from up close! +Our efforts have not been in vain!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:Hiding behind a coconut tree nearby, 4 Shiki records the Commander's every move in great detail.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:So the Commander chose to check up on the investigation team first. +That team... seems to be made up of Lewis and R93... +Let us get a little closer...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! +R93 has already started her search in the designated area! +However, I have a tiny problem here...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lewis takes out a tub of sunscreen.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Lewis... +That knave's actually asking the Commander to put sunscreen on her!!! +<size=50>The sheer audacity!!!</size>
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:<size=30>When...</size> +<size=30>...will we be subjected to such an honor...?</size>
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:This isn't the time to think about such things! +Pull thyself together, 4 Shiki! +We must capture the Commander as much as we can! This is a precious source of inspiration!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Once the Commander finishes applying sunscreen on Lewis, the latter suddenly draws closer to the Commander with the sunscreen in hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Now she wants to put sunscreen on the Commander?! +LEWIS! +W-We challenge you to a duel!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<Delay>:Hold on! +Phew...thank goodness we didn't run out... +Haha, the Commander rejected Lewis flatly.♪
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Looks like the Commander is moving on to the next team. +We'd better keep up with thee!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点2>:What is the Commander doing in such a remote corner? +Something seems to be moving there?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Commander... +I...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Isn't that QJY-88 from the rescue team? +I hear that gal has a defective swimming module... +She's been working hard on developing some device for this mission. +Still, it must be really tough on her even if she does have such an accessory that improves her ability to swim.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:How gentle, our Commander is! +Consoling QJY-88 so patiently...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:QJY-88, there you are.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Even Serdyukov is here. +According to the database, Serdyukov has undergone professional training so she should be able to keep QJY-88 safe...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Most Dolls are out on explorations these days and there aren't many of us left at the base. +I suppose the Commander really didn't have a choice but to pick QJY-88 for this mission.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +Wait a minute... +If it weren't for the rumors that we spread, QJY-88 would still be holed up in her chambers, messing around with her own inventions. +... +QJY-88, we're going to draw you as the prettiest in the upcoming chapter!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点2>:The Commander is by the sea. +Huh? Who's that...? +What's her name again...? Why don't we remember at all...? +Did water get inside our memory module?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Z-62, why are you holding the watermelon in the sea?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Oh, she's Z-62. +Under the process of elimination, she must be from the reserve team. +But why don't we see C-MS...?
Z62(3)<Speaker>Z-62</Speaker>||:Commander... +I...I'm chilling the watermelon for C-MS...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Z-62 starts telling the Commander about the reserve team's progress.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Ugh...poor Z-62! +Why would a Doll have "utterly unmemorable" as her defining feature? It must be absolutely horrendous to be constantly forgotten. +Such a fainéant, C-MS is! How could she just forget about Z-62 after ordering her to chill the watermelon in the sea?! +She's been waiting patiently in the water all this time... (Sobs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Under the Commander's encouragement, Z-62 finally starts speaking her mind.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:......
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:I knew it – she says she's used to it and she doesn't really mind, but secretly she does want to be remembered. +Z-62, you're going to be the main character in this new chapter!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Is the Commander taking a break? +Good, we can organize our drafts, too! +We've gathered enough material for several chapters today~ +We won't have to worry about having no inspiration for quite some time!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:So, the Commander's itinerary for the day was... +Briefed all members on the operation, checked up on the investigation team, forced to put sunscreen on that insufferable knave, Lewis... +Then visited the rescue team and comforted despondent QJY-88... +Next...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Huh? Who did the Commander talk to after that...? +Who was it with the watermelon in the sea...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Suddenly, a piercing scream comes from the ocean.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:AHHHHHHHHHH!!!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Someone just screamed from the sea yonder! Something that's worth dozens of chapters must've happened! +We're cominggggg—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:4 Shiki puts on a swim ring and makes a beeline for the sea. Clutching her drafts tightly in one hand and paddling quickly with the other, she approaches the source of the scream.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1>:That's... +R93 of the investigation team? +Has thou actually found a mermaid?! +That can't be... +The mermaid sighting was just some nonsense that we came up with...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点2><黑点1>:Hang in there! We're coming to save thee!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点2>:It's QJY-88! She found her courage after talking to the Commander! +The Commander has such miraculous powers!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Now QJY-88 is doing her best to make her way to R93... Hang in here, R93! +QJY-88 is accelerating. She's cutting through the water like an invincible shark! +You can do it, QJY-88! You're the bes⁠—
()<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Help! Cough, cough! +I...(gurgles)...can't swim!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:4 Shiki leans further on her swim ring to take a closer look.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:... +...QJY-88?
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:QJY-88! I'm coming to get you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing Serdyukov coming to QJY-88's rescue, 4 Shiki leans even more heavily on the edge of her swim ring.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:We knew you could trust the professionally trained Serdyukov to save the day. +Look at that fit body, that determined stride – she radiates professionalism! +QJY-88 won't be in any danger as long as Serdyu— +Hmm? What's that crow doing? +Serdyukov doesn't seem to be...
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Argh! (Gurgles) My... +...leg...is malfunctioning... (Gurgles)
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:... +Maybe we should just keep our mouth closed.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Hold on! +QJY-88... +She stood up! +The Commander's comforting words didn't go to waste!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:QJY-88! Thou hath the strength to do it! +Stand up! Stand up!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Whoaaaaa! +She's actually holding Serdyukov up in a princess carry! Isn't this the kinda stuff that comes right out of our manga?!! +As we said, QJY-88, thou art the bes—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:4 Shiki punches her swim ring in triumph, but forgets how much she's leaning onto the edge of her swim ring out of over-excitement...
4type(3)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Ahhh!!! +(Gurgles)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fortunately, 4 Shiki's swimming module is fully functional and she soons climbs back onto her swim ring. +However, her drafts aren't so fortunate...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1>:ARGHHHHHHHHH!!! +Our drafts!!!! +All our hard work is completely...!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:We can't believe we actually got the worst ending possible... +Next, our editor is going to sell us out since we can't submit any new chapters. Then the Commander is going to follow up on a tip and figure out we were the one behind the false intel... +When that happens, the Commander will have our fire-control core dismantled on the spot... +And we will live the rest of our life in the dark and gloomy coal mines...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:We suppose this is our justified retribution... +For deceiving the Commander with fabricated intelligence just so we could get inspiration for our manga. +In the end, all the drafts that we worked so hard on were ruined...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Damn it all! +We'd much rather work at a cafe than in the mines! +No, wait! What are we even talking about? Is this really the time to be thinking about where to go in our exile?!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:4...4 Shiki! +...Shiki...4...!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑点2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:4 Shiki? 4 Shiki?!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:!!! +Commander!!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You scared me to death! I thought your neural cloud was malfunctioning due to the heat. +You've been muttering about coal mines and cafes to that watermelon for a while now...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Commander... +There...there's something we must tell thee... +However...! Before we say anything, could you please promise us one thing...?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<Dealy>:Could thou promise... +That thou won't send us away no matter what? +As long as we can stay with you, we'll do anything! <c>Alright, I promise. <c>Just tell me first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:4 Shiki comes clean about fabricating the mermaid sighting.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Oh, I see.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Commander... aren't thou angry with us...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I saw it coming. +I knew all about what you did. Didn't I tell you all my plans are fool-proof?
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Yeah... thou did. +Yet, thou still went along with it?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was always the plan to make this a vacation. +Whether there are mermaids doesn't actually matter.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Then what...does matter? <c>...The happy times when I'm with all of you. <c>...These happy times that I get to spend with you, of course.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You're right. All our inspiration comes from spending time with everyone. +But today we've been so busy trying to make our deadlin...ugh, nothing... +We just feel like we've missed out on all the fun.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Commander...We...We also treasure the time we spend with you. +It's just...We're so happy...that thou also thinks so... +Sadly, today we've been so busy trying to make our deadlin...ugh, nothing... +We just feel like we've missed out on all the fun.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay. +We haven't run out of time to have fun yet. Come and get ready for dinner with us.
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:...Okay! +Thank you, Commander! +We think we finally understand...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑点1>:We'll be right over yonder!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:Manga is very important to us. +Because it is a record... of many beautiful and unforgettable memories for us... +Even if our neural cloud gets formatted one day, we just have to read our manga... +And we'll surely remember the Commander and everyone again!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:But manga has never been the whole point. What truly matters is the happy times when we're with Com...uh, with everyone. +We started out as a manga artist to document our happy experience, but then we ended up overlooking the joy of being with friends just to draw manga... +We even got so distraught over the loss of some drafts...
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:In the end, we're still in possession of the joy we experienced today – it's all stored securely in our neural cloud. +This happiness is the only thing that's one of a kind and irreplaceable!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Alright, we should go and help the Commander with making dinner! +We'll start working on the new chapter when we get back to base! +How could we miss out on having a good time with everyone just for the sake of drawing manga?!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Guys! +Here we come!!
