()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><BGM>m_19christmas_theme</BGM>:It's 6:00am on the 25th of December.+I'm doing my rounds in order to ensure that the various preparations for Christmas are going smoothly.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll go check on the present-shopping first, then the distribution of the presents, followed by the decoration of the Christmas tree...+And then there's also the prep work for the Christmas party...+So why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Good morning, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good morning, Lewis.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:You're up early today, Commander. Is there a lot of work to be done for Christmas?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For me, not really. After all, you're the ones who're doing all the heavy lifting. I'm just coordinating and supervising.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's good. Looks like it won't interfere with our promise!+That's right, Commander, you haven't forgotten our promise, have you? <c>I remember.<c>I don't remember.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:...How could I forget? Of course I remember.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:<color=#A9A9A9>What promise? Why don't I recall anything about it?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Could this be what I've forgotten?</color>
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:That's wonderful! ♪ You're such a nice person - both inside and out, Commander! +Hehe, I'll go get ready, then!+I'll come look for you when it's time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:...What promise? I don't seem to recall it.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:... +So you don't remember after all...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Lewis, I'm sorry, there's just too much for me to keep track of...+The human memory can't compare to a Doll's neural cloud.+Please tell me about our promise again, I'll make sure I keep my part of it.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I just can't get mad when I see that innocent face of yours. +Alright then, our promise is still in effect. +I'll go prepare myself and look for you afterwards.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis runs off happily.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did I really promise Lewis something? +Why don't I remember anything about it at all... +Looks like I'll have to ask Kalina to schedule a physical for me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:I continue making the Christmas work arrangements as I mutter to myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the Griffin dorms. +Lewis sits in front of the mirror, diligently applying her makeup.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:My eyebrows aren't quite even... The right side seems a little thicker.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis slightly lifts her eyebrow, carefully adjusting its shape with her eyebrow pencil.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:My brows should be done soon—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Snap— +Lewis' eyebrow pencil breaks between her tense fingers...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh no! I just bought this eyebrow pencil and it's already... +For some reason, the eyebrow pencil breaking before the Commander keeps our promise strikes me as an ill omen... +Huh? Have I been infected by R93...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis hurries and puts on her necklace with the message-in-a-bottle pendant.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I hope this brings me luck... Oh drifting bottle, please ensure that I'll be able to successfully keep my promise with the Commander...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:After making a fervent wish on her bottle necklace, Lewis quickly throws on a coat and steps out of her dorm room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Even with my rounds complete, my brow remain firmly furrowed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...So what IS this promise, anyway?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis pops out in front of me, dressed in her Christmas outfit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Lewis, your Christmas clothing this year looks amazing.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hehe, thanks for the praise, Commander! +I just met Springfield and she said your work was finished for the moment. +That means it's time to keep our promise.♪
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course, but...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Come with me, Commander. +I've already picked out a good spot, now all that's left is for us to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I wonder if I'm seeing things, but when Lewis looked back for just a moment just now, her face seemed very red...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And where are we going?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Just follow me. Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis' braid sways to the rhythm of her delighted footsteps. +I follow behind her, leaving the base in silence.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>So the promised place isn't in the base?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Looks like I didn't promise to modify her or upgrade her body...</color>
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, do you still remember the present you gave me last Christmas?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Oh no...</color>
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Back then, we took our presents from under the pretty Christmas tree, and then we opened them. +Although the preparations for Christmas were tiring and time-consuming, the most vivid memory in my neural cloud... +Is still that time when we laughed and smiled together.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis turns around and shows me the necklace with the bottle pendant that I gave her.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:This is the present I received back then, and it's really pretty... +Every time I look at it, I recall the happiness of that day.+Therefore, I've decided that from now on, I would spend a happy Christmas with everyone each year.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I quietly breathe a sigh of relief.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, so to keep our promise, let's hurry up and join the Christmas party.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Of course! Let's make haste, then, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Lewis' pace speeds up, and I have no choice but to pull my coat tightly around myself and follow her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...15 minutes later.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Are we there yet, Lewis?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Almost! Are you feeling tired, Commander? +If you can't move any more, why don't you let me carry you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No need for that! I can still walk. How much further is it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I strain my eyes and look into the distance. Although I can't see very far on this snowy night, I estimate that we're still on the outskirts of the forest near the base.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It's just ahead! We're almost at the place I found for this promise!~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis smiles at me and runs ahead. +However, a surge of unease comes over me as I look at her cheerful form.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm heading into the woods on a snowy Christmas night with a girl. Could this be...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I unconsciously stop in my tracks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is it like the Christmas Murder Incident from the Gindaichi Case Files?! +An angry girl hid in the forest when her beloved forgot a promise and used a machine gun to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:My heart skips a beat at the thought.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No way, that can't possibly be true... +Haha, what was I even thinking?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:I look back at the route we took here. It's nothing but snow, with nobody in sight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She must have brought me to a secluded location like this because she wants to do something that she can't do in front of everyone else... +And the details of the promise must never be revealed to others...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Holding each others' hands tightly on a quiet patch of snowy ground while the snowflakes fall gently from the night sky... +An idea hits me like a stroke of lightning.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait... Don't tell me... +No way...
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander? Not coming? +If you don't keep up, we won't be able to make it for the Christmas party later!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I force down the trembling that originates from deep within my heart and respond to her, then drag my rubbery legs through the snow and continue forward.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lewis... Is she... +Is she going to confess her love to me?! +That can't be, right...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The further I go, the more worried I get. I almost don't even realize that I'm walking funny.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What should I do? The Commander's manual didn't list a procedure for a situation like this... +I can't accept her feelings; it would be unfair to Lewis and the other Dolls... +But if I reject her, how am I going to get along with her from now on...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:My forehead is so wrinkled with worry and I'm so lost in thought that I don't even notice as Lewis walks back up to me.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Pffft— What are you doing, Commander? +Is this some kind of new trend?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lewis, I...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, close your eyes, Commander. +It's time to keep your promise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lewis gently covers my eyes, then grabs my hand and pulls me through the darkness to parts unknown...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Snow crunches under my feet.+Meanwhile, Lewis's steady warmth flows into my hand.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Everything is silent, but my heart pounds thunderously, like an overloaded washing machine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I hope Lewis doesn't hear this...</color>
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:We're here, Commander. +It's time to keep your promise with me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis lets go of my hand, and my heart rate suddenly spikes. +However, nothing happens after that.
()<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Commander, open your eyes!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>6</BIN><Night>:I do so, and a picture-perfect pine tree comes into view.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>m_19christmas_theme</BGM>:What do you think? Isn't it pretty? +I spent almost half a month picking out this Christmas tree!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? Picking out a Christmas tree...? +Was that our promise...?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Yup! Didn't we promise to enjoy a merry Christmas together every year? +How can you call it Christmas if you don't have a Christmas tree?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We promised to celebrate Christmas together every year... +Which means I promised to pick a Christmas tree with you?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:So you DO understand, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Something's wrong with this whole situation, right? Still...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>It looks like I'm the one with the problem, rather than Lewis...</color>
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, is something wrong with the tree I chose?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of-of course not, I think it looks very good, +It's got a very good shape, and its branches are— +Huh? Is that a squirrel?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:It IS a squirrel! Wait, there's more than one of them... +There's an entire nest of squirrels in this tree!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis, who had been fired up until now, suddenly deflates.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Shall we...help the squirrels move?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...+The squirrels must have worked hard to prepare for this day too...+They must have stocked up lots of food, invited their friends over, then they huddled up in their warm home together, chattering happily as they munched on their snacks... +I can't bear to ruin the squirrels' Christmas just so we can have a merry Christmas...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...There are still a lot of trees around here. Let's go find a new one for our Christmas tree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Lewis, who was depressed just a moment ago, suddenly perks up again, and joins me in my quest to find a Christmas tree.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><Night>:...10 minutes later.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What do you think of this one, Lewis?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hmm... It looks okaaay...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I'll ask some people from the base to help bring this tree back—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before I can finish my sentence, Lewis pulls out a chainsaw from nowhere...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:No need for that, Commander. I'm all you need.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:As I watch the sawdust thrown up by Lewis' chainsaw, I shudder slightly as I put down my communicator.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Lewis puts down the chainsaw.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:The tree topples lopsidedly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:As I step forward to trim the excess branches, I see Lewis staring off into the distance— +I follow her gaze.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still thinking about the original tree?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Well, it was the best-looking tree in this forest, and I just feel that if it's not that one... +Then this Christmas won't be perfect.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, because our tree isn't perfect, this Christmas won't be perfect either? +Lewis, what's your idea of a perfect Christmas?
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hm... To me, it should be one with the best-looking Christmas tree, the loveliest decoration at the base, and lots of pretty presents!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Springfield could've organized a Christmas like that all on her own.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's true... What about you, Commander? What's your idea of a perfect Christmas?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:To me, a perfect Christmas would be one where I can see everyone in their Christmas outfits, looking as happy as can be.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Wow... The way you described it makes me excited too! +I want to see how everyone looks today! +Commander, let's hurry back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lewis picks up the tree and breaks into an effortless jog.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As we pass the perfect tree from before, something falls from it and hits Lewis.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker><Shake>||:Ow.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lewis! Are you alright?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Lewis puts down her pine tree and picks up a woven wreath from the ground, thoroughly confused.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Is this...a mistletoe wreath?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:We look up at the same time. We catch a fleeting glimpse of a squirrelly silhouette vanishing into the branches. +We break into smiles.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Let's go, Commander. +We still need to make it to the Christmas party.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, let's go.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, Commander, do you know the story behind mistletoe wreaths?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:My smile freezes on my face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Is she talking about how people who meet under the mistletoe have to kiss each other...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:My heart begins to race again...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't know I don't know I don't know anything!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In order to ward off any strange leaps of the imagination, I run off towards the base while I yell those words...
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Huh? Why's the Commander reacting so strangely? +Isn't it a legend about a mother's love...?
()<Speaker>/Speaker>||:Lewis watches the Commander run off into the distance in great confusion and has no choice but to pick up the pine tree again.
Lewis(4)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Wait for me, Commander!
