KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Good morning, O Chosen One.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:KSVK, you'd better have a damn good explanation for this buffoonery. +Or else I'll stuff the biggest fine I can write into your hat!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Do not be angry, M870. We shall soon usher in a storm the likes of which have never been seen before.+And before the storm comes, nobody can know what they will gain or lose to it.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Explain yourself quickly while you can still speak. +If it's not funny enough, I'm gonna shoot a hole right through you and turn you into a donut.

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Getting real tired of your crap here.

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Man, they spouted as much crap as KSVK did. In any case, there's the monster team and the victim team, and the more victims that the monsters scare, the more points they get.+Still, are they really going to use the volume of the screams picked up by this detector to tell if someone is scared?+It just seems dumb...but eh, isn't that Griffin's way of doing things?

WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Where did they go? I've been hiding there for so long but I didn't manage to scare anyone...

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Oh yes, pretending to be a monster is the easiest thing today.+That's because everyone else is dressed up like one, so I don't need to disguise myself any more...
