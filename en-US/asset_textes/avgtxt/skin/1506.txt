()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑屏1>:Griffin receives a request three days after the theater incident to hunt down the remaining attackers at large.+According to the plan for today, I will be leading a team to locate the hideout of the attackers and then coordinate with the government to capture them.
()||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2>:In front of the Griffin base.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Over here, Commander! Ready to go?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks for coming today, PzB...+Er, that bike is...?
PzB39(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:PzB is dressed like a racer and is leaning against a motorcycle. My gut seizes up.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:It's my personal ride. Pretty cool, isn't it?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, it sure is.+Although...surely you don't intend to take me to our destination with your bike, do you?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Of course we're taking this bike. Why else would I bring it all the way here?
 ()||:She's as straightforward as ever.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about Griffin's cars?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Kalina said that driving a military vehicle there might scare our targets off, and our civilian cars are on other missions.+Just so as it happens, I have this bike on hand. I'm thinking that if we ride over there with this, we'd look like ordinary people going out for a ride.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ordinary people, huh...
PzB39(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I give PzB39's outfit a quick once-over. What's her definition of “ordinary”, anyway?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Your face looks kind of stiff, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Nonono, you did well in taking everything into consideration...haha...+It's just...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Is this vehicle not good enough for you?+I should note that while it may not look like much, it's no cheaper than my outfit!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, that wasn't what I meant. How could I look down on anything of yours...
PzB39(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:My experience in the past few days have left me wary of getting onto motorcycles.+Although PzB is a little outspoken, she is quite stable and disciplined in combat. In addition, she has even brought helmets along, so she probably would not be as wild as AEK...+...Right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...It's not often that I get to ride with you, PzB.+Let's go. We wouldn't want to keep the others waiting.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏1>:Don't worry, Commander! We've got plenty of time.
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Five minutes later...+PzB is racing down the road with her motorcycle.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Commander? Commander!?+You're grabbing me too tightly! You're going to rip my clothes!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I-I'm sorry! I was nearly thrown off just now...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:You're too tense, Commander! It was just a simple lane change! You wouldn't have been thrown off!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...A simple lane change!? You were flying from one lane to another!
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Ahaha...turning around like that is the fastest way, otherwise we'd have to take the long route.+But you can relax now, Commander, the road's clear from here on out!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏1>:The road...the road's clear? Isn't that even scarier!?+PzB! We've got more than enough time! Slow down—!
()||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:PzB and I reach the rendezvous point before long.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:This place is a deserted wilderness... It seems even S.F. isn't interested in this area.+Gr MG5 hasn't arrived yet, so I guess we made it ahead of time.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Commander, are you alright? Your face doesn't have any of the colors a human's skin should have!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think it's...motion sickness...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Eh? Sit down and take a rest...+I've got some water here, want some?
PzB39(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Only in this moment when I take the water bottle from PzB's hand that I begin to feel that she's a nice person...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Coughs)...+You T-Dolls...are you all so aggressive when riding motorcycles?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:What's this? It sounds like you've ridden with others before, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:AEK gave me a ride several days ago when I went to watch the opera. 
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Really? If it's AEK...+I often hang with her, and her bike-riding doesn't seem very wild.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...That's because you're T-Dolls! Elite T-Dolls!+I'm human! My insides aren't as sturdy as yours!
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Haha, you do have a point.+Still...it feels awesome to ride like the wind, doesn't it?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It does feel awesome indeed, but it becomes hard to bear if you overdo it.+Speaking of which, do you often go out biking with AEK?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Yeah, we often go for a spin when our off days align.+Even though my bike isn't as flashy as hers, I won't lose to her when it comes to racing!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Oh yes, I'm keenly aware of that.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Would you like to join us, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...I'll pass! I can't keep up with your speed.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Don't sell yourself short, Commander.+You've led us to many victories before!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course I have confidence in commanding battles.+But I feel that a few more rides with you guys and I'll end up being checked into Griffin's sickbay.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Relax, Commander. Bikes aren't as scary as you make them out to be.+Besides, isn't it embarrassing for a commander of Griffin to be frightened of a simple ride like this?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I may interject, what you guys do is not what most humans would call “a simple ride”. 
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:In that case, I'll give you some special training on my next day off, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:A few more times and you'll be used to the sensation of racing down roads.+Once you get used to it, you can also enjoy the thrill of speed, Commander! 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. That's too...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Ah, Gr MG5's here, Commander.+I guess that means my mission is complete.
PzB39(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:PzB waves to Gr MG5 as the latter approaches, and then remounts her bike.
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:I'll be leaving now, Commander. Don't want to hold you up.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on, PzB! About that “special training”...
PzB39(2)<Speaker>PzB39</Speaker>||:Yup, special training, one on one. Don't forget about it.
()||:PzB leaves me with a dashing smile that utterly fails to boost my spirits, and in an instance, she has already disappeared down the road.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hah...+I really don't want to ride a motorcycle again...
