SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><Shake>||:Eeep...Aaaaaahhhh!!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(S.A.T.8 is so over-the-top. Is it really that scary...?)</color>
()||<黑屏2><BIN>88</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Several minutes later.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Hold on, I-I'm still calibrating... My neural cloud is a little... +It...it's Bren's turn next, isn't it? Please get ready...
()||:Looking incredibly pale, S.A.T.8 gasps for air as she stares frightfully at the "phantom" fabric covered in red powder lying on the floor.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Phew... That really scared the living daylights out of me.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hehehe...
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>;MDR(2)||:MDR, I know exactly what you're planning. +You'd better not upload anything that happened today onto Griff-chan!
SAT8(4);MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Aw, c'mon! You were so funny, S.A.T.8! +Trust me, it would become the hottest thread of the day!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;MDR(2)||:I suggest you don't do this. +If the Commander finds out about this, you probably won't have the chance to spam the forum for the rest of the week.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>;MDR(2)||:Th-that's right! +Besides, we'd make trouble for Miss Kalina, who arranged this secret venue for us!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Tsk, but it's such a shame not being able to share this on Griff-chan... +I've prepared so long for this day.
()||:MDR snaps her phone shut.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:(Whispers) Thanks, Bren.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Don't mention it. I'm doing this for my own sake, too.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Still, please don't make your story too scary.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:What's the point of a ghost story if it isn't scary?
BrenMK(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:That's right, there's a first for everything, S.A.T.8. +Now that you've heard a ghost story, it should be easier to mentally prepare yourself.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:But it feels the same no matter how many times I've done this. +...Aren't you even the slightest bit scared of ghosts?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Certainly not. It's actually strange for a Tactical Doll to be frightened of such things.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:But think about it. An endless maze with labyrinthine passages... A dark space filled with ghosts and monsters... And horrific laughter that comes from nowhere! +Any of these scenarios is enough to make my neural cloud go haywire...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Stop spooking yourself, S.A.T.8. +If I ever found myself in those situations, I'd just destroy the ghosts or monsters. Then everything would return to normal.
BrenMK(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:But that'd be boring... +If it were me, I'd explore the whole thing and find the treasure hidden within the maze!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;TAC50(2)||:When in an anomalous situation, shouldn't it be the priority to eliminate the anomaly...?
BrenMK(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:But Halloween is supposed to be strange! +The fact that you're taking part in our event proves that you're also seeking thrills that you can't get in your daily life, right?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Don't lump me in with you. +I just happened to be free so I got dragged here by your scaredy-cat organizer to boost your numbers.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hey, shouldn't you be getting back on track? +I'm almost done writing a ghost story post.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Don't tell anyone about tonight!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Alright! Anyway, let's move on to our next ghost story. Hurry up, Bren!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Right then, here I go.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Bren picks up a burning candle. The faint candlelight flickers eerily before her.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:This is a story that took place in a <color=#FFFF00>theater</color>...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>15</duration><delay>50</delay></闪屏>:... +What was that?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Some kind of malfunction in the lights?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Doesn't matter... It seems to have returned to normal. I shall continue. +Before the new play had its premier, some strange noise could be heard in the empty and spacious auditorium every night. +The management had been trying to find the source of the noise but to no avail. +Until one day, when the <color=#FFFF00>theater</color> was being renovated and they opened up the wall...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<白屏1>:...and found...
()||<白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:... +A vast amount of data suddenly floods Bren's neural cloud and interrupts her thoughts for a second. +Then...
Bren()||<白屏1>:This is...
()||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><BIN>96</BIN><白屏2>:The warehouse is gone. Bren finds herself in a glamorous theater. +The auditorium is completely empty except for...
???()||:(Whimpers)
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:That sounds like...S.A.T.8?
()||:Bren searches in the direction of the voice and finds a panicking S.A.T.8 in between two rows of seats.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh...what in the world is going on?! What is this place?! +And where is everybody...? How did this happen?!!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:S.A.T.8, calm down! +I'm Bren, I'm standing right next to you!
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><||<黑点1>:Oh, it's you... Thank goodness... +Sorry, my neural cloud is a mess right now. Let me organize my thoughts...
()||<黑点2>:...A few minutes later.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:So right now we're trapped within an unknown database on Level II?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Yeah, theoretically speaking, that should be the case. +The others probably also got dragged in.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:We should leave this place. +Do you know where the others are, S.A.T.8?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:All I can do is detect their presence... I can't lock onto their precise locations. +Sigh, if only I had a specialized electronic warfare module.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:It's only natural we aren't equipped with things we don't normally use. +In that case, let's just focus on finding the exit. The others can all fend for themselves so there's probably no need to worry.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>SAT8</Speaker||:Right...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:S.A.T.8, you don't look well.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><Shake>||:We're in a completely unknown space, you know... +I just can't shake the feeling that there's something bad around here.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Something bad?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><Shake>||:Might even be electronic ghosts or something...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Huh?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:It's Halloween so this kind of supernatural stuff is bound to happen, right? +But we're Dolls, so instead of encountering human ghosts, we're seeing electronic ones especially created for us...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:I'm surprised you have time to think about this kind of stuff...+Are you using up all your RAM to process such useless thoughts?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Uh...well...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Concentrate on finding the exit. If we do come across your so-called "electronic ghosts", we'll just have to fight.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay, I understand... Let's go then.
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>97</BIN><Night>:The two Dolls leave the theater and walk along a dimly-lit hallway.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:This is a huge theater, isn't it?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Indeed. +<color=#A9A9A9>(But why a theater...?)</color>
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<震屏>:...Whoa!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Bren grabs hold of S.A.T.8, who almost tripped.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Are you alright?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:I'm fine... Just tripped on a pumpkin decoration. +Shouldn't have brought so many with me... +But there's no way I could know beforehand, is there? Ahaha...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Say...are you sure you're fine? +I expect a Griffin elite to react more calmly in such a situation.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sorry for the trouble... I'll try my best to keep calm.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑点2>:This hallway seems to go on and on, doesn't it...?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:<color=#A9A9A9>(A theater...)</color>
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Bren, are you listening? +I think I see...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:<color=#A9A9A9>(I felt something strange when I started talking about the theater out there...)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(Could it be...)</color>
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Bren!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Huh...?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Bren, are you alright? You've been spacing out...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:I'm fine, just thinking about something. +Perhaps I might have something to do with our being here...
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:What?
()||<黑点2>:...Bren explains her suspicions to S.A.T.8.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:That could well be possible. +Perhaps something in your story triggered this paranormal incident.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:...If that's true, then this is entirely my fault.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:No one could've seen this coming, so it isn't your fault. +You just so happen to have told a ghost story that MIGHT have triggered this. +To be fair, it could've been any of us, don't you think?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:You are all victims here so I must at least take some responsibility for what's happening...
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:S.A.T.8?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's leave this discussion about responsibility for later. The bad things have shown themselves!
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:... +S.A.T.8's pumpkin attack eventually disperses the mob of electronic ghosts that had the two Dolls surrounded. +They finally manage to find a way out once things have settled down.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:Right, we'll be able to get out of here soon! +But do you mind giving me a second, Bren...? There's something I need to sort out over here.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Sure, take your time.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Is there something on your mind?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:It it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have been able to get out of that.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:We're companions from the same base. Don't mention it.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:I apologize for being rude to you earlier. +And if I had noticed the sign of danger sooner...
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Haha, why are you taking such things so seriously, Bren?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:What?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:To me, this is hardly anything so serious that you have to take "responsibility" for. +This isn't a mission... We just got together to share stories for fun to begin with.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:...
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Just enjoy this festival like TAC-50. +Now that I think about it, she must be having the time of her life right now...
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:...I suppose that's how you elite Dolls are different from us.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:This has nothing to do with being an elite or not. You've simply been too tense.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Too tense?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Precisely. The "Conqueror of the Training Ground" is quite famous among the Griffin Dolls.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:What sort of nickname is that...?
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:In any case, you should chill and relax when it's time to rest. Proper rest is also key to getting stronger! +I'm sure the Commander would agree.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Chill and relax...? That does sound pretty nice. +Since we're in an electronic haunted house, we should enjoy this adventure that's tailor-made for us.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Haha... I won't say I'll exactly enjoy that, but I suppose this is what Halloween is all about?
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:Then let's turn back and explore the place.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<震屏>:What?!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:...Alright, maybe next time.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Phew... Don't scare me like that, Bren.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;SAT8(4)||:We'll save that for next time too. +Right, let's get out of here...or we'll never get to finish the ghost stories.
BrenMK(2);SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,0.5</白屏1>:Okay, then let's go!
()||<白屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:... +...... +And that's how we spent the bizarre night. +S.A.T.8 ended up freaking out over all the ghost stories. Looks like TAC-50's exposure therapy doesn't actually work. +As always, Griffin is filled with a bunch of unruly dorks with no sense of danger... But that isn't really a bad thing.
Bren()||<黑屏1>:At least I learned a new way of getting stronger tonight...so I got something out of this experience.
