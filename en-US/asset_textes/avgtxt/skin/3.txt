()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Commander…+On second thought, I don't think I wanna go…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>But you're already here, all dressed up, so what are you having second thoughts about?</color>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:The ghosts in the haunted house are really scary…!
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Even if ghosts are real, Dolls don't turn into ghosts, so human-turned-ghosts wouldn't haunt you.</color>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But can ghosts tell the difference between a human and a Doll…?
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>They…probably can't.</color>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker><Shake>||:Then…what should I do…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry so much. The other Dolls built this haunted house. Even if you run into a ghost, I'm sure it would be a fake one.</color>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But a fake ghost with the intention of trying to frighten you is even scarier!
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well…in any case, just don't be afraid. Gr Mk23 and I will be with you.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Wait in the lobby for us. We'll be right over as soon as Gr Mk23 finishes changing.</color>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But there's nobody else here…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She's almost done. We'll be there real soon!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If you feel scared, try to think of something else to distract yourself!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…Call ended.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:……+(Whimpers)…+It won't end up with only the Commander and I going in, right…? Everyone said they all wanted to see the haunted house…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…Gr MP5 sits alone in a corner of the empty lobby in the haunted house.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:"If you feel scared, try to think of something else."+…Try to think of something else… Try to think of...+…+Oh, they did a great job decorating the entrance! You can't even tell this was an old warehouse...+I wonder what this material is. Is it a hologram projection...?+Ah! Cold... It's not a hologram projection...
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,6</黑屏1>:...+If everything inside a haunted house is supposed to scare you, then I should be fine if I'm in the lobby, right?+So if I stay here, I shouldn't run into anything scary...+…
()||<黑屏2>0,6</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Click.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:…Right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker><Shake>||:Eh?+Wh-Why did it suddenly go dark? Is this a part of the show?+Did it start already? Hello, is anyone else here…?+…Ah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(Thud)+Gr MP5 trips over in the dark.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Whimpers)…Commander, where are you…+I don't want to be alone in here… How do I get out…
()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Why does it feel like the path has gotten narrower… Was the exit like this…?+Eh? What is this I feel on the wall…?+...Is this…a face? +Huh?+…
()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:<Size=60>HIYAAAAAAAAAAA!</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The power went out at the warehouse designated as the location for the event for some unknown reason. This is as far as I know.+Not a soul was in sight when I rushed to the haunted house entrance with a flashlight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How come there's nobody here?+Gr MP5, are you in here?
()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:<Size=60>NO NO NO NOOOOOOO!</Size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<快跑><SE1>Runstep</SE1>:(Her voice is coming from within the haunted house!)+(Did she mistakenly wander inside in the dark?)
()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:UUUUUWAAAAAAAA STAY AWAY!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<Size=60>Gr MP5! Where are you?</Size>+<Size=60>Stay still and don't wander around!</Size>
()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I-I can't!+There's a ghost!+There's a ghost chasing meeeeeee AAAAAAAAHHHH!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Did the others mistaken Gr MP5 for a patron of the haunted attraction?)+(Well, She technically is, but not right now! …There's no choice…)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<Size=50>Hey! Whoever's the ghost chasing Gr MP5, stop!</Size>+<Size=50>Gr MP5, where are you?</Size>
MP5(3)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Commander…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So here you are. Phew, if anyone else saw you, they surely would think you're playing a part in the haunted house with how disheveled you look.
MP5(3)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Commander…it's so dark in here…+I obeyed your instructions and stayed in the lobby, but…but…
MP5(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay, don't fret.+The event started earlier than I expected, and they turned off the lights in the lobby.
MP5(3)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:So…it was all planned…?
MP5(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah…yes, this was my mistake.+I forgot they were going to turn off the lights. I should've told you to wait outside.+Give me your hand. We'll get out of here.
MP5(3)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:…+Ok…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:…Gr MP5 hides behind me as I'm holding her hand, leading her out with my map.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(We must look like juicy targets to the T-Dolls staffed in the haunted house right now…)+(Even I'm starting to sweat a little…but I have no choice but to put on a facade of confidence…)+…+…Jeez, it wasn't smart of you at all to enter alone.+At least bring a flashlight like me, otherwise it's easy to get lost in here.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:This is my first time in a haunted house… I didn't think that far…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.25</CGDelay>:Then I guess your only choice is to follow me.
()<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:Darlingggg! Are you insiiiiiiide? Why did you suddenly disappear leaving only a vague messaaaaaaaage?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Crap… Why did she come? I told her to stay in her room!)
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Commander… I think I heard something…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Turn off your sound locator module. That's the cry of a banshee. Misfortune will befall you if you listen to it.
()<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||:<Size=50>DARLINGGGG!</Size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Gr Mk23 will get the wrong idea if she sees us like this…)+(It's impolite to not answer when someone is calling for you, but there's no other way…)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…I hastily turn off the flashlight.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ack! …The flashlight… How could it go out at a time like this…?
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Ehh? It went out???+What should we do?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Whispers) Don't worry, I remember the way out.+But we need to be quiet, otherwise we'll alert the people that are trying to scare us.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Whimpers)…Ok…
()<Speaker>Gr Mk23</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:<Size=35>DARLINGGGGGG! Where in the world are youuuuuuu?</Size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...I sighed in relief as Gr Mk23's voice drifted farther away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(I should at least…take Gr MP5 to the exit before I come back for Gr Mk23…)
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Commander…how far are we from the exit…?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're almost there. The exit is just right up ahead.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I start to feel uneasy even though we are almost at the exit, as if I have forgotten something important.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Is something supposed to be here in the plan that Springfield proposed...?)+(Damn it, of course there's going to be something at the end…but I can't remember what that thing is…)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:…Gr MP5 suddenly squeezes my hand tightly.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Commander…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:W-What is it…?+Did you see something?
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Box…+There's a box there…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(This box… What's it doing here…)
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Is this the only way out…?
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The exit is right past it!+Don't look at it and just keep walking.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Whimpers)…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(I can only pray that whatever's inside the box requires electrical power to function…)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hand in hand with Gr MP5, we make a beeline for the exit.+…But unfortunately, or perhaps because our footsteps are too loud, whatever's inside the box is alerted to our presence.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:UGHHURGHHH…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Eh? What…?
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr MP5, don't look! Just move!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…But no matter how hard I pull Gr MP5, she is firmly frozen in place.+…BOOM.+Whoever's inside the box, or rather, the coffin, sends the lid flying with a single kick.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:RAAAAGHHHHHHH....AARRRGGGGHHHH...
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><震屏>:<Size=50>WAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!</Size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(The worst has happened! I need to get this thing away from Gr MP5 quickly!)
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<震屏>:<Size=55>HERRRRREGGGHHHHHH…ARRRRRRGHHHHH...</Size>
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:<Size=60>WAAAAAAAAAA!!</Size>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Everybody keep calm! Stop it, all of you!
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:UWAAAAAAAHHHH GO AWAY GO AWAY GO AWAY!!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr MP5, calm down!
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:WAHHHHHHHHH!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…Not only did Gr MP5 not run away, she hysterically pounces at the shadowy figure instead.+The two petite figures in the dark are entangled into a ball, rendering any bystanders unable to intervene.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:GO AWAY! GET AWAY FROM ME!!
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Whoa! Aw! Ouch! S-Stop it... I don't like pain... Ack! Aw!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Stop fighting, both of you! +H-How on earth has it come to this...
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:UWAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:S-Stop hitting me! I'm sorry! I-I was wrong... Ahhhhhh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>0,3</白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Click.+…The power is finally restored, and the darkness is lifted.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Panting) Huuu… Fuuu…
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:…With the lights finally back on, I can see a look of relief on Gr MP5's face.+Under her foot is Gr G11 that has been beaten to unconsciousness.
G11(5)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Uuuuggg…
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:He…heehe…+So this ghost wasn't so scary after all!
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Umm…+Yes, just as what I said before.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:It would've been great if you had told me earlier that I can knock out a ghost, Commander…because then I wouldn't have had to worry so much.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:…+There wouldn't be a point to the haunted house experience if I told you that earlier.+But congratulations, you seem to be no longer afraid of haunted houses.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm, even so, I don't know if there are any even scarier monsters in this place…+I still want to leave as soon as possible…
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1>:…+After putting the unconscious Gr G11 back into her coffin, the two of us exit from the haunted house.+Having to search for the exit in a completely dark haunted house is honestly quite frightening.+But being able to make it out with her fists…probably makes Gr MP5 far more scarier than ghosts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:But why would a T-Doll be afraid of ghosts?+Is it the fear of the unknown…or is it the fear of death…?
