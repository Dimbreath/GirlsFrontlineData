()||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the Griffin cafe.
()||:After ordering a cup of black coffee, I take a seat by myself at a table in the cafe's corner, and I watch the Dolls in maid uniforms as they hurry back and forth. +Gr G28 is serving dishes, M1 is carrying the menu, NTW is pushing her food handcart, and Contender is greeting the customers... +It would seem that everyone had put in a lot of practice for this field mission. +I, on the other hand, have only to think of the mountains of bills and reports that Kalina had stacked on my desk, whereupon my head begins to ache. +... Since this place is air-conditioned and has coffee refills, why not duck out of work for a little bit over here? +I finish the last drop of coffee and lean back in my chair and close my eyes in contentment as I give that some serious thought.
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...Commander? Why are you sleeping over here? +Hey! This isn't a place for you to sleep. Wake up!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Rubs eyes) Uuuurgh...
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The form standing before me slowly resolves itself into clarity. +It's M950A, dressed in a maid's uniform and carrying a bucket and a long-handled push broom. +I stare at her in silence, probably because I have a great deal of difficulty making a connection between "M950A" and "an obedient maid".
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:...Is there something on my face, Commander?
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er, no, it's nothing. I just overslept a little.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:If there's no problem, would you mind moving aside for a while? Otherwise, I won't be able to clean this place if you're here.
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I hurriedly stand up and move aside, and M950A immediately begins cleaning the place where I was sitting. +At first, I thought she was only going to scrub the floor, but then to my surprise, M950A takes out a cloth and a spray bottle. +She wipes down the table, the underside of the table, and the table legs. +Right after that, she repeats the same process on the chairs. +Looking closer, I realise that the other seats and tables in the cafe have also been cleaned in the same way, and they are gleaming under the hanging lights.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wow, it's spotless... It's been cleaned in the same the way as those professionals we call in every month. +Did you have special training for this, M950?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What are you saying, Commander?
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M950A plants her hands on her hips and announces this with an air of cool pride.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Don't you think it's only to be expected that someone like myself, who represents the good discipline of Griffin, would set a good example for others?
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sizes her up) For some reason...I find it hard to associate you with the words "good discipline".
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:W-Why is that?
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't you think dyed hair gives the impression of being a little rebellious?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:I don't dye my hair! These are my factory default settings! It's my original hair color! +Also, there must be something wrong with your thinking if you associate me with "delinquency" just because I have pretty hair!
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahaha, well, then I apologize for my rudeness. You really are amazing indeed. +We were commissioned to send Dolls out to provide security for an international conference, which is why we selected several Dolls to undergo hospitality training in order to serve at the venue. +You asked to join this mission of your own initiative, and you were unusually serious about your practical training.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Well, the plan was to pick one member of each echelon for the field mission in order to minimize the impact of temporary personnel loss.+ ...I'm pretty sure Thunder or AEK would have caused all kinds of havoc if they had been chosen, so I had no choice but to step up to the plate.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Motives aside, it would be good if the other Dolls could turn in the same performance you did.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:The other Dolls, huh. They're a never-ending stream of problems, both big and small.
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she said so, M950A furrows her brow and begins counting off on her fingers.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Contender talks as quiet as a mosquito. She doesn't sound at all like her usual reliable self, even after she went and got an outfit specially made for this operation. +M1 buries her head in stacks of papers and is all gloomy and depressed, like the world is ending. Since she's here already, can't she cheer up and pull herself together? +NTW is worse, she completely ignores what everyone says and does her own thing. +Gr G28 even managed to blow up the microwave and she's got an opinion on everything. Is she trying to help us or sabotage us?
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:After hearing M950A list off those names, I remember the various sights I had seen in the cafe over the past few days. All I could do is smile helplessly in the hopes of washing it all away, however awkward.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Aw, don't say that. It's good that everyone's full of character, right?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:You're right, Commander. +All Dolls have their strengths, so an exceptional Doll like me—
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She actually strikes a pose while leaning on her push broom. It would seem she is really enjoying this.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<震屏>:Ought to become a role model for my colleagues who can't even achieve the standard, and lead all Griffin Dolls toward a better tomorrow!
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Claps) Er, well, do your best.
G28(2)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ah! Found you! So this is where you've been, 950!
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;G28(2)||:Is something the matter?
M950A(6);G28(2)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Miss 950, the kitchen hasn't been cleaned properly!
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;G28(2)||<震屏>:W-What!? That's impossible!
M950A(6);G28(2)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Hehe, didn't expect that, did you? +Shall I teach you the proper way of cleaning a filter tank, my dear model student Miss 950?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;G28(2)||:What!? I'm sure I gave it a thorough cleaning... +Ah, sorry about that, Commander. Let me clean up your place first so you can continue resting.
M950A(6);G28(2)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Hehe... +See you in the back, 950.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ah, I think I've rested enough...
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Commander, have you heard the rumor about a "legendary tome of maid wisdom"?
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...No, I haven't. Rather, does such a thing even exist?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:It seems Gr G28 is acting as cocky as she is because she went and asked Gr G36 to give her some secret manual for this operation.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And here I was wondering why Gr G28 had set herself up as the maid instructor. It would seem she had someone else backing her up. +But isn't it a good thing to have a skilled colleague giving you pointers?
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:All she's doing is imitating what she sees. Such petty tricks won't get her anywhere. +Isn't that microwave explosion from before the best proof of that? She didn't learn anything important at all.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...
M950A(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:In truth, everybody wants to do their own job well, and they all have ambitions of their own for this external assignment. +It's alright to be suitably competitive, but going too far can become very troublesome.
M950A(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In times like these, isn't leading everyone onto the right path the duty of an exceptional Doll? +In addition to your own tasks, you should seek to help your teammates who can't keep up, even if this is just a temporary arrangement. +As for Gr G28, I'm pretty sure she'll be able to sense your intentions if you just carry out all your chores with your usual meticulous attitude.
M950A(6)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Commander... +Alright, since you've said as much, I promise that I won't disappoint you. +Please watch my performance, Commander! See you later!
()||:M950A grabs her bucket and push broom and leaves for the back. +Even through the door, I could hear some muffled words being exchanged... +While I'm curious as to whether they are arguing or properly communicating... +I eventually manage to suppress the urge to listen in on them.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah. If I stick my nose into this too much, I'll be like a helicopter parent rather than a commander. +I should believe in my subordinates in times like these.
()||<黑屏1>:It's just like how I learned a bit more about M950A today. +Gr G28 and M950A could use this opportunity to learn more about each other. +Even if there are some friction, this is something worth looking forward to. +After all, this is the way through which people begin to get along with each other.
