()||<BIN>85</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The work of picking out bridal outfits and shooting locations is finally done for the day.+While this operation is fundamentally a protection mission, the part of it that involves the photo shoot is a novel experience for both the Dolls and myself.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑点1>:Finally done with today's reports.+Huh... Is it only three o'clock?+The mission is tomorrow, but for some reason time seems to be passing really slowly...+I think I'll have a stroll around the base.
()||<黑点2><BIN>80</BIN>:As I enter the cafe, I notice SV-98 sitting by the counter, completely engrossed in the display in front of her.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, SV-98.+What are you doing?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:Ah, hello, Commander!+I'm just doing some research on our mission tomorrow.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you researching?+I don't recall there being anything that requires extra information...
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:We're wearing wedding dresses and taking pictures tomorrow, aren't we? That's why I'm going through some literature on photography...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well... Once we get there, all you need to do is to listen to the what the pros say.+You shouldn't need to prepare for this.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:The responsibility of taking photos does not lie solely on the photographer. The model has an important role to play too.+Therefore, I must research the most photogenic poses for tomorrow.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm glad that you're so enthusiastic about this, but...+Have you forgotten that tomorrow's mission involves more than just taking photos?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:While the ultimate goal of the mission is to provide protection for our client...+Didn't you say that the pictures would be used in publicity ads for the company and IOP?+Since we're going to take them, then we ought to make them as effective as possible. After all, this affects our corporate image too, right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(She hardly ever argues back like this... Looks like she's really invested in the whole picture taking thing.)+Ahem, I wanted to remind you not to lose sight of the objective.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:You're worrying too much, Commander.+When have my calculations ever been in error?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You do have a point.+Since you say so, I'll just have to look forward to your performance tomorrow.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I won't let you down!
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>97</BIN>:The next day.
()||:I hear the faint voices of a disagreement as I pass by a photo studio room while patrolling the building.
SV-98()<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Are you really sure that's a good pose?+It would be better if I put my hand here, right?
摄影师()<Speaker>Photographer</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Miss, just trust me.+As a professional, I want to make you look as good as possible.
()||<BIN>138</BIN>:I enter the room to see SV-98 standing in front of the backdrop while talking to the photographer.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(SV-98 in a wedding dress is night and day compared to her normal self...)
()||:She sees me and waves at me.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:You're here, Commander!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I happen to be passing by, so I came in for a look... Did something happen?
摄影师()<Speaker>Photographer</Speaker>||:You must be the person in charge from Griffin, right? Can you help me talk some sense into her?+She wants to do her own poses, but that won't bring out her best look.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:I did a lot of studying before we came here!+Many of my poses are straight from classic photo collections, and I'm sure the angles of my arms are perfect!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+How about this, why don't you ask the photographer to take a shot with your favorite pose, and then do as the photographer asks for another shot?+Then we can compare them, and if the photographer's is better, then you'll have to do as she says?
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Very well. If you say so, Commander...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:Ten minutes later.+SV-98 and I compare the two pictures in question.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:H-How did it end up like this?+I followed the best pose according to my data, but why do I look so awkward?+I spent so much time measuring the angles... The data should be correct...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you ask me, photography isn't something you can do with measurements alone.+The same thing can look different in different environments.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:Eh...?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How should I put this...+It's just like what we normally do. We operate in different ways depending on the battlefield.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:...Is that how it works...?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not to mention, art isn't quite the same as war.+I'm not too good at phrasing this, but being too stiff can sometimes backfire on you... It makes you appear very unnatural.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:So the reason why the photographer keeps saying “a little to the right” and such...+And she doesn't tell me exactly how far I should move is because of what you said, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Probably... In any case, "what looks best" isn't like target shooting. There's no absolutes.
SV98(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SV-98 looks at me with confusion in her eyes.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:This is too complicated for me, Commander. +But if I have to do whatever the photographer says...+It makes me feel uncomfortable, like I'm just an ordinary decoration for photography.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh?+(Why would she think that?)
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:While I was looking through the photo collections last night, a thought came up for some strange reason. +The women in the photos looked like they were standing in front of me in real life, looking back at me...+Seeing the expressions on their faces, I could feel how happy being able to wear a wedding dress must be for human women.+I...I want to take pictures that convey that happiness too!+I want pictures that fill me and everyone else who view those pictures with joy.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:Haha... Commander, you must think my neural cloud's short-circuited.+I think it has myself...but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to delete that thought.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't think there's anything wrong with you, SV-98.+If you feel this way, then I'm certain you'll be able to take photos that you're pleased with.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:But I don't know how.+Is it really enough to only do what the photographer asks?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Display those feelings of yours before the camera.+Relax a little, don't worry if your poses are a few millimeters off...and smile if you're happy. I think that'll be enough. 
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||:Mmm... Although I don't completely understand what you mean, I'll try to do my best!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, just do your best to work with the photographer.+I'm sure they want to take the best pictures possible as well.
SV98(2)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I understand now, Commander.+I'll be carrying on with my mission, then!
()||<黑点2>:I continue to watch SV-98's shoot in the photo studio room.
()||<黑屏1>:For human women, wearing a wedding dress holds a special meaning. Is it the same for Dolls too?
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:I don't know the answer...
()||<黑屏1>:But in this very moment, I see her lips curl up ever so slightly.+And her smile is a perfect bullseye.
