MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Oh my, what's this interesting thing I see?
()||:MG3 carefully studies the poster on the wall.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:"In two days' time, Griffin will be holding a test of courage. Interested Dolls can scan the QR code on the bottom of the poster to register..."+While I'm kind of interested, I need to put exercise first.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +The QR code scanner makes a noise, but MG3 realizes that she didn't scan anything...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:"The system is unable to process the request due to too many applicants?"+I came over to take a look because I thought there might be a problem, but I didn't expect that Murphy's Law would be in full effect.+Looks like Class Rep's art skills are pretty good, but we'll need to boost that processing power.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Is this the test of courage that you're organizing, Hawk? Looks like a lot of people are taking part.
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Of course. It's not like we have much chance to play around on most days.+How about it, are you interested? Since I'm here, you don't need to scan to sign up.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Forget about it, I haven't finished my goal of running 10km today.+I won't be able to cut down my weight if I miss even a day of exercise.
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Cut? Cut down where? Your body looks good enough as it is.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Here.
MG3(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:MG3 points to her chest.
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Aw, you want to cut those down? +I'm green with envy over here.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:You utter moron! How are these things good? It's not as though we're humans. +The most important things for Dolls are their mission and their orders!
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:And food! +Hehe, I'm sure 56-1 and the others would say that if they were here.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:(Sighs) I envy your neural cloud and its lack of defects, Hawk...
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:As if. Things don't always go the way we want in life.+It's the same for me.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;97typeS(2)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Really? Since we're man-made objects, we don't need to uphold human concepts, do we?
MG3(0);97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hehe, perhaps the answer to that question is something we have to find for ourselves.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Well? Want to give the test of courage a try?
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:And that was how Hawk tricked me into participating in the test of courage. +Why "tricked"?  That's because—
()<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:The amount of contestants for the test of courage had reached maximum capacity, and I was thus forced to join the security team.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:That said, it's not so bad to dress up like this from time to time.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:Are you...MG3...?
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Oh hey, so you're working with me, Model L. +I didn't expect you to be back so soon.
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;MG3(4)||<黑点1>:Model L is stunned by MG3's outfit... +But after exchanging a few more words, they throw themselves eagerly into their work.
MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||<黑点2><黑点1>:Ugh... Why...is this happening?!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Hey, Model L, did you hear that?
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||<黑屏1>:Yes, analyzing... Target identified, it's MP40's signal. +Follow me, I know her coordinates!
()||<黑屏2>:One hour later, Model L and MG3 have just finished completing MP40's request... +Then they get another distress signal.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Model L, there's another Doll in trouble. This one's at the northern supply point.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:I've got it too. Let's hurry.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay!
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Jeez, that took you a while!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hehe, disappointed that I'm not the Commander?
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Huh?! This has nothing to do with the Commander! I'm totally not bothered that the Commander didn't show up! It-it's true!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:MG3, you don't have to spell out something so obvious. +Besides, there are other people in trouble waiting for us.
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Hey!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Understood. The next one is...
()||:Model L and MG3 run off in pursuit of the distress signal.
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hey, what do you mean by "something so obvious"?!
IWS2000(2)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<黑点2>:I'm so sorry for making you go all the way back to get my clothes...
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;IWS2000(2)||:Don't worry, it's our job.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;IWS2000(2)||:Still, AUG really is something. She guessed exactly what we were getting for you. +Just handed the clothes to us without saying a word.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;IWS2000(2)||:MG3...we promised Miss AUG that we wouldn't tell her that.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;IWS2000(2)||:Oh dear, I forgot! IWS, pretend I never told you, hahaha...
IWS2000(2)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...+<color=#A9A9A9>Really...she's gone and taken care of me again.</color>
()<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Ah—! What the heck is this?!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Looks like there's another Doll in distress.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:This is a pretty tough job. We don't even have time to chat.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ow—! Mayday! Mayday!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:I just said that...and there's someone else in trouble!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Really now... There sure are a lot of Dolls in trouble tonight. +You head over to M870's side. I'll handle the other one.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Got it. I'll send the coordinates to you. +Be careful when moving alone.
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Model L nods and heads the other way.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...10 minutes later, MG3 reaches M870's position.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You have GOT to be kidding me.
M870P(2)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Hurry up and get this thing off me!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Then this is the only way!
()||:Hawk raises her gun.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hey! Calm down, you guys! +How can you point a gun at your own people?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Then what should I do? I still need to go get the Commander.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Right... I'm sure there'll be a way if the Commander's around!</color>+You just wait here—
M870P(2)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Wait for what?! Don't you dorks understand what's going on? +How much longer do I have to be stuck in here?!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Honestly...
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Wait, Hawk! Give me five minutes; I'll be back right away!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the same time, at the starting line of the test of courage...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Well, I did make Hawk a promise, so I should take some time out to take part in the test of courage.  +That's strange... Was there such a long platform at the entrance?
()||:The Commander climbs onto the platform, then someone suddenly comes into view...
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Ah, Commander, have you only just arrived?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:KSVK...? +No, you're...
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:Does it matter who I am? Today is Halloween; a surprise or two is only to be expected.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I hope you don't cause misunderstandings in the name of springing surprises.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:Hehe, don't worry. I simply wish to take part in your antics for once.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but for the sake of everyone's safety, I'll have to shut off your—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:Suddenly, the Commander slips— +And falls from the long platform.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>The platform collapsed?! ...Griffin's construction materials are just too flimsy.</color>+Hey—! Griffin Commander!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK?</Speaker>||:...Hm, it seems that must be fate. There's nothing to be done here.

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Commander—!

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry, Commander! You're fine. +There's a full moon tonight, so open your eyes and take a look.
MG3(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM><BIN>1</BIN><Night><睁眼>:The Commander's eyes open, and discovers that their head is resting on MG3's chest—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Excuse me!
()||:The Commander frantically scrambles to get up.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hehe, if I weren't around, you'd have broken something, Commander. +I didn't expect you could be so flustered.<c>Well, I AM a man, after all...<c>Even though I'm a girl as well, I can't...
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Really? +I'm glad to hear you say that, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah...? +Is there something strange about what I said?
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:No, that's not it. +Rather, hearing you say that is really reassuring - I'm not just a tool that's only good for completing missions to you.<c>As long as I'm around, nobody will treat you as tools.<c>In Griffin, nobody will neglect your rights as Dolls.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:I understand, but...I'm a Doll...+So why am I doing things that my neural cloud hasn't processed? +I hate my shortcomings, yet I used them to save you, Commander. +And now...I'm even feeling happy about this defect of mine. +Is there something wrong with me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that so...? You think of it as your "defect", and yet you're happy about it. +I think it might be the same as it is with us humans.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:The same as humans?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah. If mankind suddenly lost all its flaws and life went exactly the way we wanted it, with everything being perfect and successful...would we still keep striving for peace and happiness?
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Wouldn't that be a good thing? At the very least, we wouldn't be living in such a messed-up age like we do now...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, if that were to happen, the human heart would grow numb. +It would be worse than it is now.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:The heart?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, the heart that feels "happiness".+Without "flaws", there would be no desires for better things in life... And when peace and happiness come, how would your be able to experience them with your heart?+We live in such tumultuous times...+So we ought to overcome our flaws in our pursuit for something better. That's why Griffin exists.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:... +But are Dolls the same? +The only thing I've ever wanted is only to have them become smaller.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You...
()||:With a shake of the head, the Commander approaches MG3.
MG3(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What would you do if you really lost that "flaw" of yours?
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:I'd perform better in my missions, of course. +I wouldn't have to keep fiddling with my gear because of them, and I'd be able to reach the frontlines sooner.
MG3(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, so what you really want...is happiness for humans.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Huh? I want humans to be happy?
MG3(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You simply haven't noticed what your true thoughts are. You've always wanted to lose weight in order to better help us. +It was precisely this "flaw" of yours that made you strive for self-improvement. +...And that's why you felt happy after saving me.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Really...? +My processor is too old, so I only understand a bit of what you're saying, Commander.
MG3(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'll explain ag—
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You don't have to, Commander.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏2><边框>2</边框><BIN>82</BIN>:Really? Since we're man-made objects, we don't need to uphold human concepts, do we?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<边框>2</边框><黑屏1>:Hehe, perhaps the answer to that question is something we have to find for ourselves.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:I'd like to find the answer myself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see. Then I hope you'll tell me once you find it.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yup!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Under the star-speckled night sky, under the cool, gentle full moon that looms above them...the Commander and MG3 walk slowly through the grounds. +Are they both thinking the same thing?
()<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:... +Ahhhh—! I forgot about M870! +Commander! Quick, follow me!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:W-what's going on?!
()<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hawk's going to shoot M870!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:WHAT?!
()||<黑屏1>:Under the star-speckled night sky, under the cool, gentle full moon that looms above them...MG3 drags the Commander behind her in a mad dash. +They are almost certainly thinking of the same thing now.
M870P(2)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Somebody get me out of this damn pumpkin already!
