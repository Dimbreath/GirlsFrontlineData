()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 is sprawled on her desk, staring at the radio as she mutters to herself.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night><黑点1>:I should probably ask... While I don't really want to go, I can't say I don't want to go either. +Still, it'll probably be past bedtime by the time I give my reply.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><黑点2>:...Three hours ago.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:Knock knock.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:After a couple of knocks, AA-12 opens the door and pokes her head out. +AA-12 seems up freeze up for several seconds every time we make eye contact.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Sorry for disturbing you at this hour. +AA-12, your name is on the list for the upcoming group vacation.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...Oh.
AA12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:That's the one. I wanted to ask if you were willing to go...?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...A beach vacation, huh?
AA12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Yes. +You haven't been in Griffin long, so I was thinking, wouldn't this be a good chance for you to make some friends? +It would also make it easier to coordinate with each other when you go out on missions in future...right?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:(Silent) ... +Um, I'll give you answer in a bit.
AA12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:In a bit? Alright. +I look forward to hearing from you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><黑点1>:The door quietly closes the moment I finish speaking. +She didn't exactly slam it in my face, but...this new colleague probably doesn't like talking to me much. +I wonder if she'll agree to go have fun at the beach with everyone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><黑点2>:...Back to the present.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:AA-12 is still sprawled on her desk and staring at the radio.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:Hmm, it's about to start.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:Time in the dorm seems to freeze. +AA-12 stays in this position until several minutes later— + A burst of music plays.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker><通讯框>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF>Dear listener, I don't know if you're in front of the radio, but I have to say—</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF>Of COURSE you should say yes!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It's a beach vacation! The fact that your boss invited a new hire like you to come along means you've got a pretty nice boss! At the very least, this is the kind of boss who treats the staff with respect and wants the new hires to build up good rapport with others.</color>
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF>Dear listener, Kalin really envies you! Kalin wants to go on a beach holiday too!</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:Ah, Radio Kalin was all in favor of it... +Then I should go tell the Commander now—
AA12(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:Just as AA-12 is about to head out the door, she halts mid-step, a somewhat conflicted look on her face.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:It's so late, the Commander must be asleep by now. +And why am I acting like I care so much about this...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker><通讯框>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF>...Now let's see what questions this listener has.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>"One of my new hires doesn't seem to like me, what should I do?

NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF>As I thought, everyone's talking about going to the beach because it's summer.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:AA-12 suddenly turns to the radio.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:Huh, why does that letter sound like...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker><通讯框>||<Night><黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>...It's better to not make any assumptions about such things, don't you think?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Since she's a new hire, maybe she's just shy or nervous about meeting new people.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><黑屏2>:... +The radio host continues reading out several more audience letters. AA-12 hurriedly sits down and begins writing up another text message. After hitting "send", she stares at the radio with a conflicted but expectant look on her face.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker><通讯框>||<Night>:<color=#00CCFF> ...Alright, let's see what the next letter has to tell us.</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Radio Kalin</Speaker>||<Night><黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Ohoho... "My boss seems to have mistaken my cautiousness for animosity, but I'm just not used to interacting with other people. I hope I can sort out this misunderstanding and I've decided to go to the beach with my boss and the others."...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This listener's problem seems to be linked to a previous letter.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +The next morning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:By the time AA-12 comes to, she is already in a swimsuit on a sunny beach, with a gang of noisy T-Dolls.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:How...did it suddenly come to this...? +Crap, it's hot out here, and pretending to be normal for so long feels a little gross... +Ugh, and l'm in a swimsuit like this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 looks at her noisy, scattered colleagues and sighs. +After that, she walks the other way from the beach and prepares to seek refuge from the sun and public attention under a bunch of parasols.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Good thing I got these parasols ready beforehand... I'll just add these and make do. +...Hmm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 suddenly senses that someone's eyes on her. +She tightens one hand around the parasol handle and presses the other to her gun's barrel, then turns around abruptly— +And discovers a short T-Doll poking her head out from behind a coconut tree not far away.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker><Shake>||:(Shocked) ...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The staring contest lasts for a moment, and AA-12 sighs in resignation. She takes her hand off her gun before continuing to set up her parasols.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Crap, should I be greeting her or something...?)</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ameli sees that AA-12 doesn't seem to have any intention of chasing her away and runs over to AA-12's side.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:U-um, hola!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 jolts, then turns stiffly to look at Ameli.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:Ah, my name's Ameli... +You must be our new colleague! I didn't get the chance to speak to you while we were in the base...
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...Hello, I'm AA-12.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:So you're all by yourself over here, Señorita AA-12. +Everyone else is going to play beach volleyball over there. Would you like to join us?
Ameli(4);AA12(2)||:
()||:Ameli's big eyes seem to sparkle as she speaks to AA-12. +AA-12's body stiffens again.
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Come on, what was all that social etiquette I learned from late night radio? Think, think, I need to remember!)</color> +Ah, thanks, but no thanks... +I'm not really fond of activities involving a lot of people.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:(Quietly) I see...
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Crap, did I say something wrong?! Why is she staring at her feet?!)</color>
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:I get it! You must be trying to avoid the sun, right? +Come to think of it, the beach really is hot and sunny like our data said. It's my first time to the beach too, and honestly speaking, it really startled me...
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:A-ah, yes.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:Um, then may I ask if...I could help you set up the parasols? +It seems you've brought a lot of them along, Señorita AA-12...
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:O-of course you can.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:Really? That's great!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Ameli seems overjoyed all of a sudden. While AA-12 is somewhat at a loss, she has no choice but to go along with Ameli. +Though it has to be said that the work of setting up the parasols has been going surprisingly well since Ameli joined in. +Before long, AA-12 has a beach chair shaded by three huge parasols blocking the sun from all angles. +AA-12 realizes that this is another point that demands the use of social etiquette.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...Um, thank you very much.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:(Flustered) You're too kind, Señorita AA-12! We're both from the same base, so don't mention it!
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:(Searching for an answer template frantically in her head...) +The same base... Oh, yes, that's right,  we're colleagues. +Ameli, my friend, please accept my gratitude.
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:(Mutters) Colleagues... Friends...
Ameli(4);AA12(2)||:
()||:Just as AA-12 wonders what else she ought to say to politely end the conversation, Ameli suddenly reaches into her little pouch and pulls out something, offering it to AA-12 expectantly.
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...Eh? What's this?
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:It's a button! Please take it!
Ameli(4);AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...Hah? Oh, alright...
Ameli(4)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>;AA12(2)||:Then, I'll be heading over to join the Commander and the others, Señorita AA-12! +Adiós!
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...See you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:AA-12 watches Ameli run off happily, witnesses how she manages to trip and fall while running on flat ground, and looks down at the button in her hand.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:What's that all about? And what's with this button? Did I successfully complete an entire social interaction...? +Ahhhh, what a drag. I should just sit here until nighttime. It's so hot and bright and talking to people is a pain. +Crap, I was being all normal just now and it was super gross...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:With her head full of doubts, AA-12 resolves not to think about these insoluble problems and flops down on the beach chair.  +Just as she thinks she's about to enjoy some quiet time without the sun shining directly on her, AA-12 sees an orange-red figure in the distance, carrying a swim ring and heading straight for her...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +That night.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:By the time AA-12 comes to her senses, she has finished arguing with that orange-red T-Doll, and finds herself at the bonfire party after replenishing her sugar levels.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:How...did it come to this...? +Where is this place, who am I, what am I doing...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:As AA-12 starts spacing out, the Commander walks over.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Hey, AA-12.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...It's you.
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Well, how was it? Did you like looking at the sea?
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...The way you ask questions is getting cheesier and cheesier, Commander. +Also, sitting on the beach and looking out at the sea feels no different than looking at the ruins from a high vantage point at the Griffin base.
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:That's a pretty bleak impression of things.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...Yeah.
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:I had hoped that our presence would help keep this stretch of sea or the Griffin base from feeling too desolate.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:(Silence) ...
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:I find every day happy and fulfilling because you're all around!
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:...I didn't ask for your opinion, Commander.
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:And I don't particularly mind you overhearing what I say to myself. +While we're all just lonely individuals, surely there's a big difference between a place with and without everyone around, right? +In any case, welcome to Griffin, and I hope you'll find happiness while you're here.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<Night>:Happiness...even in a place or ruin and destruction?
AA12(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Happiness doesn't necessarily take physical form. It might be a man-made concept, but it transcends this desolate world.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:AA-12 stiffens. She thinks about the button in her palm, and the faint sourness of the lollipop in her mouth.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<Night>:Would you like to come to the beach again in future if you have the chance?
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Silence) ... +I think I'll only be able to answer you after we get back to the base.
AA12(2)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(Buttons and friends and happiness... What a drag, but they're also...)</color> + <color=#A9A9A9>(I need to ask Radio Kalin about this when I get back!)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(Yeah, this time I'll draft up a text ahead of time so I can be the first to send it into the station!)</color>
