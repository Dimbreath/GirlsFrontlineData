()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:We've finally arrived at the beach. At that time, I was still oblivious to how things would soon take a dangerous turn. +The sun, the sand, and the gleaming sea — everything seemed so peaceful. +Except for...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><震屏><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Ahahahahaha—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as I think I can breathe a sigh of relief, FAL bursts into laughter from where she's standing beside me. Naturally, I'm startled.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What, what's the matter, FAL?
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Don't you feel happy, Commander?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, I am happy...but I didn't expect that I'd still have to make a bunch of headache-inducing choices even on vacation.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Well, life's about facing choices all the time.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There it is! FAL's actually spouting philosophy!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You ought to put your airs aside and listen to your T-Dolls' advice from time to time.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's the last thing I want to hear from you...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Well, this is a hard-earned holiday. ♪ +So don't be so uptight, Commander—
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, I've had this feeling all day, but...FAL, you're in higher spirits than usual, aren't you? +<color=#A9A9A9>(Or rather, you're kind of like Mosin when she's had too much to drink...)</color>
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Bien sûr, heeheehee!
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(I've never seen FAL laugh like that before...)</color>
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:At long last, an occasion where she isn't following me around. I've finally got the chance to do whatever the hell I want. +This is a true vacation, Commander!
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:As if she's received a blessing from Heaven, FAL roars in laughter, causing her entire body to convulse violently in her swim ring and splashing water square in my face. +Still, I can't bring myself to get the slightest bit angry as I watch her. All I can do is hold onto her swim ring lest she get carried away and dump herself into the sea.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While I don't know what you're getting at... Seeing you so happy proves that coming to the beach was the right decision.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Hehe, it's definitely praiseworthy, Commander~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While I'm exchanging idle banter with FAL, Gr G36 arrives with a smile, bearing frozen treats. +I take them and turned around to find that FAL is staring at the iced drink in my hand, which gleams with a mysterious light.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here, want to try some?
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Okay...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker><Shake>||:Eh, it's so cold!
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's why they call it an "iced drink". +The sun, the beach, the biki — ah, no, that would be ice cream — all these are standard fare for a holiday.
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL gingerly tries a mouthful, and then...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<震屏>:Ahhhhhh Commander this-this-this!
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's right! It's tasty!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:It's a "blind spot"!
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know, right... Uh, wait, what?
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:This is a blind spot in my sense of taste. +Therefore, I'm naming it the "Blind Spot"! +What do you think, Commander? It's super classy now, isn't it?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(...Not in the least.)</color>
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:I didn't think Gr G36 could actually make desserts! Gr G36's place in my heart has now surpassed Springfield's! +I need to strengthen my relationship with her once I get back to Griffin... +(Mutters) Hmm, I need to hide Gr G36 away after I go back. I mustn't let Five-seven find out about the "blind spot".
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(For some reason I thought I heard someone's name being mentioned; was I mistaken?)</color>+That said, it's true that the Café usually doesn't provide iced drinks. +Still...so that's a blind spot...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Commander, have you been to the seaside before?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? That came out of nowhere. I guess I've been there before...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Moi, this is my first time looking at the sea.
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL's expression softens tremendously, to the point where...it seems a little tender.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:While I know many T-Dolls haven't been to the sea before, including the ones in my team... Hmm. +Still, all this is still just too new to me... +It's not like going on a new operation, all of this... I'm not experienced with it.
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:This is the first time I've seen FAL reveal her feelings of "helplessness", and I'm suddenly at a bit of a loss as to how to respond.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:But today, I got to see the ocean and have some "blind spot". It's all so wonderful. +It's great that I got to experience such interesting things and make it so that they're no longer "blind spots" in my experiences. +To me, being able to know all this makes me very happy.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you're happy just seeing the sea?
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:When T-Dolls are rolled out of the factory, they're programmed with certain objectives and they have to complete certain missions. +But today, I can aimlessly while away an entire summer day — and without Five-seven around! — so what could be happier than that?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Mutters) So it wasn't helplessness after all... +Also, did I hear someone's name again just now...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Hmm? Did you say something, Commander?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, it's nothing, it's nothing. +On the other hand, I learned today that you're the sort of T-Doll who likes to explore the unknown, FAL.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Well, I am elite, after all.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...FAL, you ought to reply with something more sentimental at a time like this.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker><Shake>||<黑屏1>:Ah? Is that so? Then let's start over from the beginning, Commander—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Looking back on it all, I can't help but feel the deepest shame for my carelessness. +While FAL and I were performing our double act, neither of us realized that something was happening beneath the placid ocean surface. +Neither of us had expected that a hand...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=60>Whoaaaaa! What's this?!!!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:As FAL glances over to the side, she is so startled she almost jumps right out of her swim ring — and since I'm just an ordinary human being, I just stand there like a statue in the water — as if I was not afraid at all. +AN-94 head emerges from the water close to where FAL's hand has been dangling. She reaches slowly toward FAL with a blank look on her face.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Screams) W-w-w-what are you doing?!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Shocked, FAL reflexively takes a defensive stance — and raises her gun without thinking. +The moment AN-94 sees FAL raising her weapon, she also pulls out a gun of her own out of nowhere. +With their muzzles pointed at each other, it looks like they're going to pull their triggers any second.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Oh no... FAL only brought her water gun today...) +(And there's no way that pair from DEFY would carry toy guns with them!)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:There's little time for me to act— +Or rather, I only have an instant. +In addition, I'm just an ordinary human commander. What can I do to stop these two heavily-armed, elite T-Dolls who are probably not willing to settle this misunderstanding through communication?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:And so—
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏2><震屏><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Commander glub glub blub blub blub blub... (Coughs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:—I tackle FAL into the water. +As FAL falls into the sea, I notice out of the corner of my eye that the underwater AN-94 seems to have...swiftly stroked Fel the ferret before hastily swimming away.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker><Shake>||:What are you doing, Commander?! I almost got water in my slushie! +And what was that just now?! Th-th-there was a hand—
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—It was a sea monster!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:...Hah?
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It was very dangerous! So I'm sorry for pushing you down just now!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Ah, non, Commander, if it really was a sea monster, then wouldn't tackling me into the water have been more dangerous? +Also, didn't I just see that sea monster take out a gun...
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—Ahahaha, then maybe we were both mistaken! +How could there possibly be a sea monster here, it was probably just a huge mass of seaweed swept up by the waves, haha...
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:FAL stares at me for a while.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:...Forget it. Though it seems a little suspicious, I believe that you're not deliberately messing with me.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(I-Is she letting it go...?)</color>
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:FAL puts me out of her head and devotes all her attention to sampling the iced drink in her hands. +Just then, several people from the beach start shouting for me. After letting FAL know, I head over.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:... +When I think back on the matter, I get the feeling that I had missed something because I had been careless in my observations. +However, I would probably never know what it was.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:...At the same time, on the sea. +FAL lies on her swim ring, splashing around and sipping her drink. She turns to look at Fel the ferret.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You saw that gun too, didn't you, Fel?
FAL(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The ferret tilts its head, but does not speak.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Therefore, regardless of what it was, the Commander saved me back then... +While the whole thing seems a little dumb when you look at it, the Commander looked pretty cool just now, don't you think? +Hehe, when I go back to Griffin, I'm going to show off to Five-seven. ♪ She hasn't been jumped onto by the Commander yet, so I've got one up on her now, muahahaha—
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:So that's what you're happy about... +You're surprisingly candid every now and then, FAL...
