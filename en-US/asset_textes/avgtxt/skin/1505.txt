()||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:I see someone pushing a stylish-looking bike in my direction as I'm waiting in front of the base for the car to the theater.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Good morning, Commander.
AEK999(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The person in front of me is wearing a loose coat with a hood that covers most of their face.+I give the other party a once-over and manage to deduce their identity from the style and design of their clothing.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that...AEK?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<震屏>:Haven't you gotten my name down yet, Commander!?
 ()||:This girl...she's really loud.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not like that! It's just that you're quite dressed up today, so I didn't know how to react for a moment.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I see... My usual clothes aren't too convenient for bike riding, so I changed into something looser for today.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It certainly has a lot of character, AEK.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I've got a rich and varied melody to my style, Commander. Looks like I'll have to get you acquainted with it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I certainly look forward to that...+Oh yes, so you're going out for a ride right now?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander. It's not often that we get time off, so I wanted to head out for a spin.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That bike of yours sure looks cool...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Hehe, you've got good taste, Commander.+It took me a lot of effort to give her the most perfect rhythm possible.+So I heard you're heading out to watch Contender's performance today. Want this baby to give you a lift?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks, AEK, but Griffin has already arranged a car for me.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I see... Guess that's too bad then.+There's a lovely rhythm to the roar of this girl's engine, you know.
AEK999(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AEK-999 pats the seat of her bike with a hint of regret on her face.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Although I can't today, maybe you can let me experience it the next time I'm free.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, it's a deal then, Commander.+Both of us are looking forward to a ride with you.
()||<BIN>84</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An hour later.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't think there'd be a jam at a time like this... What should I do now...+I'll be late if the traffic doesn't let up...
()||:I become more and more anxious by the minute, but the traffic refuses to move.+I open the car window to calm myself down, and I notice a familiar black motorcycle weaving through the stagnant mass of vehicles as it heads toward me.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:It seems fate sees fit to bring us together again in short order, don't you think, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:AEK?!+What are you doing here?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:I saw your car as I was passing by.+I figured you might need help, so I came over.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes...you came at the perfect time! Can you take me to the theater?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:No problem. Hop on, Commander.
()||<BIN>84</BIN><黑屏1>:I mount up on AEK-999's bike. She nimbly darts through the stalled traffic and we soon leave that stretch of the road behind us.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:Whew... What a relief.+It should only take about half an hour to the theater... There's still 40 minutes until the performance starts, so we should be able to make it.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Commander, although the tune you're going to listen to at the theater doesn't quite suit me...+I know that before you enjoy it, you'll need ample time to sort yourself out...so that you can fully immerse yourself in it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The real performance is about to begin.+Hold on tight, Commander!
AEK999(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Ear-splitting rock and roll music pours out of the speakers mounted in the back.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What? ...AEK! I didn't catch that! What did you say?
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<震屏>:Let's ROCK!!!
()||<黑屏1><震屏>:AEK-999 floors the gas and the motorcycle's engine responds with a thunderous roar.+As we accelerate, I feel like I'm riding on a rocket, and in my panic, all I could do is to cling onto AEK so that I don't get flung off.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:Ten-odd minutes later.
AEK999()<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:We're here, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN><睁眼><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...A-At last.
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Commander, did you like my music?+What's the matter? You look kind of pale.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:I'm alright...it was...too...too intense for me...+Let me...catch my breath...
AEK999(2)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Haha, a tune's perfect when it leaves a deep impression on the people who hear it.+Well, I've got an appointment to keep, so I'll be leaving now.+Commander, you said you'd go for a ride with me next time, so I'll be sure to prepare some trendier and more striking music for us to enjoy.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright...+...No, that's not right! Wait!
()||:AEK-999 had already mounted up on her bike and was long gone before I could finish my sentence.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+I feel like I'll regret making that promise...
