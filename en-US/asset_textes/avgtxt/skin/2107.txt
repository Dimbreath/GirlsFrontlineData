NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Simply put, the client would like Griffin to stage a burglary.+We will steal the "Star of Glory" from a public venue and secretly return the jewel.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Helian notices my bewildered eyes.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That should be enough to make outsiders abandon their schemes for the jewel, leaving the client free to live their twilight years in peace.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Even though the client's message has been appropriately censored, they're still prominent enough that I could easily discern their identity.+She's an old lady who survived the Collapse and World War 3.+A vast fortune left behind by her husband, her excellent eye for investments, and a healthy dose of luck ensured her fame on the list of the world's billionaires.+The huge jewel mentioned in the file is so big that it could not be made into a ring or some other jewelry. Surely the client must have had a hard time in ensuring its security...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:This operation will take place on the client's 80th birthday, when she exhibits the jewel at a cocktail party.+That will be next week...on the same day as our company's own anniversary.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:So, about the anniversary celebration...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:We'll run it as originally planned. Your participation in this operation will be considered as overtime with additional pay.+In addition, HQ will be sending two Dolls to take part in the operation. They will be responsible for the safekeeping and delivery of the jewel.+As for how this show will be run, that is entirely up to you.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Do I need to discuss the plan with those two Dolls beforehand?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:There's no need. They will carry out their own mission. All you need to do is make it seem like a theft.+While this is last-minute overtime, do consider it as a sign of the company's faith in you, Commander.
()||<BIN>8</BIN>:...And so the transmission ends.+While I would be getting extra pay, missing the anniversary celebration is a bit of a shame.+In addition, making a gigantic diamond that is worth more than I could save in an entire lifetime "disappear" is no easy feat.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:What a troublesome jewel...
()||<BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:One week later.+At the cocktail party.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Hello? Big sis, you're ready? Gotcha, I'll head over right now.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:We're about to begin, so I'll be heading off now.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Right, it's just about time for the operation to start.+...Indulge yourself at next year's party to make up for the missed celebration.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Heehee, I was waiting for you to say that, Commander...
UMP9(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:UMP9 skips ahead and vanishes into the bustling cocktail party.
()||<BIN>139</BIN>:A moment later, my parched throat makes me consider getting a martini from a nearby Doll server, but then I hear a deliberately hushed female voice from behind me.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:"I've brought misfortune."
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...+"What a shame."+ "My motto is to treat ladies nicely."
()||<BIN>139</BIN>:Before I could look back, the owner of that voice has already circled around in front of me.
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:She looks like a mirror image of UMP9, except for that ominous smile of hers...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:My, you remembered.+Does that mean you took notes, Commander?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:How could I forget? If it wasn't for you all...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Stop, hold it right there. Keep it secret.+It's enough that you remember me.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You all went missing for a long time after that. Were you called out for another mission?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>: Are you testing me?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...+Alright, I don't want to talk about work either, so let's change the topic.+What made you decide on that dress tonight?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You mean...this?
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Unlike her sister, UMP45 is wearing a deep purple evening dress.+Though she has a large ribbon at her waist to complement her stature and looks, it could not conceal the air of maturity radiating from her.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:No particular reason... I just picked something out from the client's cabinet, just like 9.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You two are sisters, yet your standards for fashion seem to be completely different from each other.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:We've only met a few times and you're already confident enough to comment about my nature?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You have a point...+I'd like to be able to hang around you two more often.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Being around us for too long will make saying goodbye more difficult.
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:UMP45 narrows her eyes.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:This isn't my world.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:UMP45's gaze drifts outside the window.+Is she trying to leave this topic and this place behind?+I don't know, but I don't want things to end like this.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...Do you not like the atmosphere?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Perhaps you might call it...envy?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Why don't you try blending in? The atmosphere's important too.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Blending in...?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Just this once.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Beep.
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:UMP45's eyelids flutter, then she looks away from my face.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I'll have to give it a pass, Commander.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:(Sigh) I'll invite you earlier next time.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Next time?+Yes, next time...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Next time won't be too far off.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:But it won't be for long either.
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏1>:She doesn't look back at me. UMP45 quickly vanishes into the sea of people.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><Night>:...Several hours later.+The chaos at the party has settled down, and the guests are exiting in an orderly fashion under the direction of Griffin T-Dolls.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:They do not seem very panicked at all. In fact, they seem to be chattering in front of the lavish manor, discussing the curious sights they had seen earlier.+I head in the opposite direction of the guests into the vacant manor. 
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Were you waiting for me, Commander? Have you seen 9 already?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I told you that next time wouldn't be too far off.+So you've already handled the cleanup, right?
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:She pulls up her skirt and shows me the transparent container strapped to her inner thigh.+Although it's made of reinforced glass, the container could not fully block out the sparkling shine of the massive jewel within.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Just as you said, the jewel will find its way safely back into the hands of the client, so don't worry.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:You know, if I were in your place, I'd be happier in completing this mission.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:(Laugh) That's like telling a depressed person to cheer up, or telling someone with a broken leg to get out more often.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:(Shrug) Guess I'm just that empathetic.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I'm sorry, but there's no point being nice to me.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:"My motto is to treat ladies nicely."
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I should remind you that the operation is over, Commander.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:You mean I can't keep using it as my motto? I might even have it engraved on my tombstone.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:(Laugh) I can't imagine the manner of death that would lead to that being carved onto your tombstone.+And besides, I said I wasn't worth it, so why are you so concerned about me?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:That's because UMP9 looked really happy. I wanted you to have fun too, like her.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Have fun?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Yes, it's too sad to sacrifice your precious vacation to work all day without enjoying yourself in the slightest, isn't it?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...+So that's the reason?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:What?+According to the organization regulations, Griffin Dolls are scheduled for R&R between missions.+If you would like to take some time off to relax, why not request for more special leave?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...+I don't think that's possible...+After all, we're pretty busy most days.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:So you'll be out on a mission again, huh?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I can't be sure of my schedule, so I can't give you a definite answer...+...And I can't thank you either.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I-Is that so...+Still, we're on the same side, given that Griffin stole our vacations!+For next year's anniversary, I'm planning to postpone all missions so we can have a nice, big celebration on the company's dime to make up for this year's overtime. +Want to come, UMP45?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...+Commander...+You really don't know anything?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:You...+...Do you want me to know?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:No...+That's fine...
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:UMP45 backs up a few steps.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:That would be for the best.+I should go.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:You got other things to take care of?
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I told you, this time won't be for too long.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Then how about next time?+Like I was saying...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:UMP45 looks back and slightly lifts her scarred eyelid.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I'll think about it.+Next time, I'll try to blend in a little more...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:Just a little bit...for just a little longer...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏2>:Only after she leaves that I realize that was a smile on her face.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:I can't discern how much sincerity is contained in that mysterious Doll's smile.+But when UMP45 left, she was not walking slowly and silently. Rather, the echoes of her heels clicking against the marble floor echoed through the air...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I look forward to hearing those echoes again, except hopefully, they'll be the echoes of someone coming back.
