NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:...And that's the situation.+IOP discovered abnormal physical damage to parts of the data storage unit in the civilian Dolls from the opera troupe.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand. This sort of damage would almost never happen naturally to civilian Dolls.+So in addition to enjoying the opera...we'll also need to have a plan in store.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Yes. Apart from Contender, you'll also be bringing several other Dolls along to the venue just in case.+Anyone will do, as long as they're available.
()||<黑屏2>:An hour later.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:New work, Boss?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I need you to watch an opera with me.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Oh...?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...and do some other things.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Sounds like that's the important part.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I explain to Thompson the details of the mission.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Understood, Boss.+Looks like our opponents this time...are totally unlike anything we've faced in the past.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Exactly, which is also why I'm hoping you could take part in this operation.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Indeed, fighting alongside humans is my strong suit.+However...things tend to get messy when you get involved with humans.+Do you have a plan, Boss?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We don't have enough information. All we can do is prepare ourselves and respond as the situation demands.+If fighting really breaks out, I trust you know what to do.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Of course, in other words...you still want me to leave survivors?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Cough)... You're kidding right?+In any case, I'll be counting on you for this mission.+Also, as we're going to the theater, do you have any appropriate clothes, Thompson?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry, Boss.+I may be dressed like this most of the time...but I do have one or two outfits for formal occasions.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:The next day. During the theater intermission.+I meet Thompson in a hallway in the theater.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:What do you think of the show so far, Boss?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The opera's great. I'm looking forward to the second half.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Indeed. If it wasn't for the mission, I'd love to stay for the rest of the show.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? You like operas, Thompson?
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Yeah. Although I've already seen this show several times before, it really is quite different when a renowned troupe performs it...+Does this surprise you, Boss?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For some reason...you don't look like the type who would enjoy this sort of thing.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Boss, without a little class, what would be the difference between us and the punks that only know violence?+Also, my hobbies don't just include operas.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, at least I know one of your hobbies now.+Then, about your attire today...was it prepared for this kind of hobby too?
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Yeah, I spent a lot of my pay on it.+Still, even with an appropriate outfit, I normally wouldn't be able to get a good seat like this.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll think of something. A chance to watch the opera like this isn't exactly rare, provided you don't mind going with me...
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Sounds good, Boss. Looks like I'll have a new buddy to talk operas with from now on.+Ah, it's time for work, so...enjoy the second half for me.
()||:Thompson salutes and leaves.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Operas, huh... I don't know if my knowledge will pass muster with her...
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:30 minutes later, in an alleyway near the theater.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Alright lads, time to talk.+How many of your little treasures did you leave behind in the theater?
青年()<Speaker>Youngster</Speaker>||:I...I...I don't know what you're talking about!
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Blowing up the theater... You think this is a game?
M1928A1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Thompson pulls her trigger and stitches an outline of bullet holes around the feet of the youths whose faces she had bashed black and blue.+After the gunfire stopped, the youths trapped at the end of the alleyway lean weakly against the wall and slump to the ground.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It took a lot of effort to keep those bullets away from your body.+So, do you feel like talking now?
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:After the interrogation, Thompson hands the suspects to the police and rushes back into the theater.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Tch, dealing with the cops is such a pain.+Those punks really got off lightly this time...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As Thompson reaches the entrance of the theater, screams from the crowd and scattered sounds of gunfire can be heard from inside the concert hall.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><黑屏1>:Looks like the real performance is under way...+I won't need to worry about Boss with those guys around, right?
汤姆森()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Then I'll be the star today, so let's put on a big show!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The battle finishes.
()||<BIN>96</BIN><黑屏2>:The government employees looking after this incident are examining and cleaning up the scene. In order to ensure safety, the Dolls involved in this operation and I remain in the theater for the time being.+Thompson leans against a wall, looking over the ruined theater as though she has something on her mind.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Penny for your thoughts, Thompson?
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Oh, it's you, Boss.+If I'd known those punks would wreck such a beautiful theater...+I would've been harder on them.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While I'd like very much to agree with you...+Half of the people you beat up have already been sent to the emergency room.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Tch...so there's still half of them left, huh.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You really do love operas, don't you, Thompson?
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's not like I can't live without them. They're just a hobby.+I'll be leaving the rest to you, Boss.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Thompson turns and heads for the exit.+I notice the damage on her coat and its tattered edges.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you really have no regrets?+That's a good outfit. It's a shame it ended up like that.
()||:...Thompson stops in her tracks.
汤姆森()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:It's not a shame if it can be fixed.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then...when they fix the theater, shall we finish the rest of the opera to make up for today?
汤姆森()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Are you sure, Boss?+I'd be happy to, but wouldn't it be really pricy? Are you going to foot the bill yourself?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay to treat yourself once in a while. Besides, I'm quite interested in the second half myself.
()||:Thompson turns her head slightly toward me, and I see a faint smile on her face.
汤姆森()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:In that case, I don't have any more regrets about today.+It's a date then, Boss.
()||<黑屏1>:After our exchange, she waves her hand without looking back and vanishes into the street.
