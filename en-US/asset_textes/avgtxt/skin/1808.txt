()||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:The morning of Spring Festival Eve.
()||:I'm on my usual morning jog and I come across many boxes of various sizes stacked up near the pantry. +However...only one person seems to be moving them back and forth.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good morning, LWMMG... +Wow...
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's a lovely outfit you're wearing... +But are you the only one here? +And...are these the ingredients to be used today?
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Good morning, Commander. +And yes, we'll be using these ingredients today. I've already inventoried them. +Now, I'll wash and sort them, then we can start cooking.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's a lot of ingredients... +And that's not what I wanted to ask. I mean...are you doing this all by yourself?
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Hm? Is that a problem? +When Type 81R was handing out tasks, she put me in charge of preparing the ingredients. +Although I don't quite understand why the grocery list was so long...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So...you bought all the food here from town all by yourself?
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Yes.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And the person who's going to move them all to the kitchen is...
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And then, afterwards, the person who's going to do the preliminary food prep is... 
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Look, LWMMG, I understand how you don't want to bother others... +But everyone on the base is part of the same team, so you don't need to handle everything by yourself.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:But I can handle trivial things like this by myself. +And...I feel that even though we're all friends, I don't really know everyone that well, so approaching them out of nowhere about this would be kind of weird...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter if you don't know them well. Working together is the quickest way to get to know each other. +Hey, you lot over there! Come help LWMMG move this stuff!
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Aw, Commander, you don't need to do that. I can handle it by—
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:While not relying on others is a good habit... +Single-mindedly helping others while refusing their help in turn makes you appear standoffish. 
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:The work is quickly completed with everyone's help.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:I can't believe we actually finished so fast. I didn't expect to make this kind of progress...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The saying that "many hands make light work" applies to most situations, after all. +Hm...though it's also true that "too many cooks spoil the broth"...
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Personally...I work better when I'm alone. +It's only when I have everything under my control that I feel at ease.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That said, I'd like you to let others know when you feel overwhelmed by your duties. +It's not just for yourself; your companions can often think of ideas that you have trouble coming up with. +Naturally, it'll be more conducive to completing your tasks, too, but I would personally like it if you didn't push yourself too hard...
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Yes...I understand. +Still, Commander... +While I'm in charge of procuring the ingredients, I didn't actually realize what the kitchen wanted them for until just now...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er... well, about that...
()||:With the contents of the boxes sorted and arranged, the kitchen is bursting at the seams with the ingredients. +Right now, it's difficult for the people inside just to move around.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I think...this amount of food is a bit much, even if it's meant to feed all the Dolls at the base... +These...and all these things will go bad quickly if they're not eaten by today... Even if we put the rest in the freezer...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm...Type 81R did mention in her plan said that this year's Reunion Dinner would be especially lavish... +But this amount is way beyond what I imagined.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Sigh... There's so much food here that'll go to waste if it's not eaten... +And it's all high-quality stuff... There's even meat...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm not worried that the meat will go to waste... Rather, I'm more concerned that the others won't be able to get their share before SPAS-12 and the machine gun Dolls grab it all... +Still, it's not often that we can get everyone together like this. If I had to choose between getting the portion size just right, or erring on the side of caution to make sure everyone could eat their fill... +Yeah, I'd choose to pile the plates higher.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:You're hoping that things will be more lively?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, the most important thing on a day like this is for everyone to get together and make lots of noise. +It's good to scrimp and save on most days, but Spring Festival's the time to splurge!
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I understand... +But let me get this straight, I'm only going to do this today! +I'll be back to my usual ways tomorrow.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Got it, just for today. +Still, will you still be wearing these clothes tomorrow? They suit you very well.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:They...they do?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This festival's going to last several days. You should make the most out of it.
LWMMG(2)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Yep, I will!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Later on, Gr Mk 23 turned these ingredients into a sumptuous Reunion Dinner, and everyone had a wonderful night. +While LWMMG couldn't help but grumble as she cleared the tables, her expression and tone were quite indulgent. +Perhaps...if there comes a chance to have yet another banquet at a similar occasion, I can see her like that again.
