()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:On a certain morning.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not often that rest days come along, so dodging documents from Miss Kalina today shouldn't count as slacking off. +After all, this is a hard-earned rest day, so I should get some sleep. Yes, I'll decide what to do after a nap...
()||:My body slowly carry my brain out of the command room with that thought in mind. +As I pass by the entrance to the cafe, I see a very familiar face.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Although, her outfit...is definitely not familiar at all.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:W-Would you...like to come in, Commander?
()||:Standing in the doorway, I'm momentarily at a loss for words. +And only now that I remember they have recently been carrying out specialized maid training in the cafe.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not today. +I'm sorry, things happened so suddenly that I had no idea how to respond for a while... +That, and you look very cute like this, Contender.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:I-Is that so... Thank you, Commander.
()||:Just as I'm about to continue on to the break room, I see Contender tugging at her skirt with both hands. She looks like she has more to say.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did you want to say something else?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Startled) Ah, yes... +Actually, I would like to seek your help with a request of mine...
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You want me to help you practice or something? Sure!
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Shocked) How did you know I was going to say that, Commander?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's my Commander's instinct.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Your instinct... That seems a little suspicious, don't you think, Commander?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Certainly not. I've got a reasoned conclusion to back it up. +After seeing you in these clothes, I thought of what happened before at the theater. +So if I stick with you now, something very interesting might happen again♪
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Blushes) I-Is that so...
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes. +For some reason, I've got a rough understanding of how you think, Contender.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Blushes again) Ahem... +Uh, then I'll be counting on you for the next few days, Commander.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Mhm, it's settled, then.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Afternoon of the next day.
()||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:At the Griffin cafe. 
()||:I come to the cafe as arranged. +Upon entering, I see Gr G28 hurrying back and forth.
()||:After a brief exchange of words, Gr G28 directs me to an empty table. +I go through the all-too-familiar menu for appearance's sake before ticking my choices and handing it back to Gr G28.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, I'll have these, then.
G28(2)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay, please wait for a bit. +Another Doll will attend to you in a bit!
()||<黑点2>:After Gr G28 leaves, it doesn't take long before I see Contender coming towards me with a drink on a serving tray.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Quietly) Your iced tea, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That was fast! +I mean...thank you!
()||:With her hands firmly gripping the sides of the tray, Contender inclines herself forward and offers it to me. +She watches me with a very uncharacteristic look of apprehension, but there is a hint of anticipation in her eyes.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Contender, did you make this yourself?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Quietly) Yes, Commander. +Um...do you like it?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Very much!
()||:I notice Contender's expression relaxes for a moment.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I say, Contender, why have you been so quiet all day?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Huh? W-Was I being quiet?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh yes. +I don't know why, but you seem very reserved today. +And why are your movements so stiff? Are you not feeling well?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:...
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:Contender's face turns even more red, and she seems even more at a loss for what to do next.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:...Ah, I'm sorry! +Sorry, sorry! Please forgive this tactless barbarian!
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:...It's fine, Commander, I understand. +For some reason, starting out from scratch as a maid is quite tiring...
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, you never were the sort of Doll who had cuteness as a selling point in the first place.
()||:Contender looks extremely crestfallen.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Ah! I definitely don't mean that you're not cute!
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:I...don't understand your meaning...

Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Um... +What I'm trying to say is, have you considered going for a different type of training?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Huh?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah...it's just that...you don't quite give the impression of being a maid. +I'm not saying you're no good! You make excellent iced tea! So if you're not a waitress...
()||:Contender's head is lowered and I could not see her face, but I have the feeling that her eyes would betray her resignation. +Still, seeing Contender in this state — in a pretty dress, and blushing with a put-upon look on her face — is a rare thing indeed, so why am I still being so harsh to her at a time like this? +I begin to resent myself from just now, the one who had asked that question.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—I got it! It's because of your outfit!
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Ehhhhh?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It must be because your clothes are too cute! +You look absolutely adorable in a maid outfit, Contender! I ended up getting lost in staring at you! +Therefore, you must find it tiring because the pressure of wearing a maid outfit is too great!
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Pfffft, what nonsense are you talking... +Then tell me, what kind of clothes should I wear?
()||:I breath a sigh of relief as I see a smile on Contender's tense face.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, I wanted to say "you look more like a prince", but really, you look good in anything, don't you?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:(Coughs) Thank you, Commander. +Also, I apologize, but I cannot change the sort of training that I am undergoing. +We will only be assigned to specific tasks once the mission begins, so for now, we need to be schooled in every aspect of the job.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see, hm. You'll just have to work hard, then.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, I feel a little...unsuited to working as a maid. +However, since I've accepted this mission, I must complete it flawlessly.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:As precisely as a formula?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander. Just like a formula.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's the spirit! +Although, you only need to plan things out 99% of the way.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:99%...?
Contender(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The other 1% is luck, which I'll provide. +I'll be by your side.
Contender(4)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:(Blushes) Thank you, Commander...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BOOM!
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2><火花><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:I am startled by the sudden explosion from the kitchen, but just as I am about to warn Contender to be careful, I look back to see that the "usual Contender" has returned.
Contender(5)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Commander! Are you alright!?
Contender(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine... +But what happened to your outfit? Wait a minute, why do you have your gun out?
Contender(5)<Speaker>Contender</Speaker>||:Commander, they say a man can't cross the same river twice — the same goes for Dolls. +I'm fully prepared this time; I won't let the suspect escape!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on, Contender, this isn't what a maid—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:But before I could finish, Contender has already lowered her stance and charged into the kitchen with her gun in hand. +I have no idea what exploded, but the cafe is filled with thick smoke. +After consoling the other Dolls, I prepare to enter the kitchen myself to see what is going on.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM><关闭火花>:(Coughs) I can already imagine how tough Contender's training will be in the future... +But...I have to accompany her to the end.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I quietly make up my mind, deep in my heart. +After all, I'm her precious 1% of luck.
