()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑点1>:Spring Festival is less than a week away. +According to the plan Type 81R gave me, I'm supposed to be checking the costume preparations for the festival.
JS-127(0)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:Huh, is that you, Commander? What are you doing here?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Type 81R asked me to help her with the inspections. +You're in charge of preparing the New Year clothes, right?
JS-127(0)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>()||:You're just in time, Commander. +I was about to get the clothes I ordered from the tailor. Want to go see them with me? +Having you around will help when I go over them.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sure, I'll go with you.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2>:At the tailor's.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you done yet, JS05?
JS05()<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:One sec. I'm almost finished! +This button is giving me a bit of trouble... Alright, I'm coming out now!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:JS05 steps out of the changing room.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:What do you think, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It looks good, JS05. +It definitely suits you.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hmm... I need to tidy up my bangs to match this qipao...
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||<黑点2>:How about now?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er... is there a difference?
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:I let my bangs down a little, there's a huge difference! +Commander, I question your powers of observation.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're the one who's asking so much of them...
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Hehe, well, my work does demand great precision, after all. +Come help me inspect these clothes, Commander! Treat it as practice!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, I'll give it a try. +Speaking of which, these clothes seem quite different from the styles which everyone usually wears... Will they be willing to put them on?
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Don't worry about that, Commander. No Doll would refuse new clothes. +Also, any Doll who isn't happy about something this new and stylish must have abysmal taste!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(She doesn't mince her words at all...) +Well, I'm looking forward to the New Year even more now that you've said that. +I'm sure it'll be interesting to see everyone dressed differently than how they usually are.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Mm, just wait for it, Commander. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. +Oh yes... now that you mention it, have YOU bought new clothes yet, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Me? I haven't really prepared anything. After all, celebrating Spring Festival was the Dolls' idea...
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Since Type 81R assigned you to vet my work, that means you're part of the Spring Festival prep team. +And we agreed that everyone taking part would need new clothes. +Besides, it was you humans who came up with the custom of wearing new clothes to celebrate Spring Festival in the first place!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really? +I'm not too familiar with the old ways of celebrating it...
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:My database can't be wrong. +However, it's probably too late to make you an East Asian outfit, so let's go out shopping afterwards to buy you something.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't bother. I don't really celebrate this festival myself, just hopping on the bandwagon with you guys... +Also, I have to work this afternoon, I probably won't have the time.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Commander...are you afraid of going shopping?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:N-not really, it's more like there's a meeting at HQ this afternoon. +I'm more afraid of Miss Helian's wrath than shopping!
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Alright, I'll tell the tailor what alterations to make before we go back to base.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Does it still need altering?
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Of course! Spring Festival clothing needs to be properly prepared! +Honestly, this is a human festival to begin with...you ought to take it more seriously.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, different places have different practices. +I'm sure Christmas or New Year would be more carefully observed here.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:But you didn't change into new clothes for those two festivals, did you? +I heard DSR and the others say that the people here also practice the tradition of wearing new clothes for the New Year.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But given how things are now... +It's good enough that we have the luxury of celebrating these festivals at all. Don't quibble too much about the details.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:When you put it that way, life really does sound tough for humanity...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It is...uh, how did we get onto such a depressing topic? +We're going to celebrate a festival soon, so let's cheer up!
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:You've got a point. Look forward to our Spring Festival then, Commander! +It won't lose out to Christmas or whatever! +We're still a few days away, so try to take some time out to get new clothes, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright, alright, I'll have a look in town if I find the time.
()||<黑点1><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After returning to the base, I soon become engrossed in the various tasks involved in moving from one year to another. +Soon, the matter of buying new clothes is well out of mind.
()||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN>:On the afternoon of Spring Festival Eve. +I return to my office after quelling the disturbance caused by an accidental ignition of fireworks.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Whew... I can't believe I still have to take care of this sort of thing before the celebrations start... I'm beat.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:There you are, Commander. +...You look pretty tired. 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, yes, something unexpected happened. I could really use some rest.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:It must have been because of ART556's antics, right? Must've been tough cleaning up after her. +I didn't expect her to do something so thoughtless just to have fun...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You seem pretty well-informed...
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:Hehe, I simply overheard it from the others on my back back. +I've been looking for you because of this...
JS-127(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:JS05 hands me a box.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is this?
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:New clothes for the Spring Festival. +I'm guessing you've been too busy to buy them. Fortunately, I happened to be heading out today and saved you the trip. +I'm not sure what style you prefer, so I just bought you a shirt. +At the end of the day, you really do need new clothes for a brand new start.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you... I actually forgot about it myself.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:You humans are so forgetful. That's why we have to remember things for you. +Wearing new clothes at the New Year clears away the bad luck of the old and brings good fortune. +It's a good sign, for both humans and Dolls!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, that's true. I'll accept it, then.
JS-127(2)<Speaker>JS05</Speaker>||:That's the spirit, Commander. +I'm relieved to see that you've cheered up now. +I need to go help the others - see you at the Reunion Dinner tonight! +And don't forget to wear the new shirt!
()||<黑屏1>:I watch JS05 vanish out the door. +They are carefully collecting and preserving all these memories of the old times that even mankind comes close to forgetting. +Someday in the future, those memories would shine even more brightly than before.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Alright, break time's over. +First, let me get changed... Then I'll celebrate the occasion with them.
