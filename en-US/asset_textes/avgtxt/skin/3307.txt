()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:If not, then you should just give up. +The final throes of your defeat are of no interest to me.
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:You were just lucky! +N-Next time... I'll definitely...!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:While there's a saying that goes "luck is the whole of your strength", are you truly that naive to truly believe that? +Still, you're a Griffin Doll, so it's only expected that some of you would think in such a way.
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Honestly...+<size=50>How did things end up like this?!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Half an hour ago.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN>:Huh? +This isn't what we agreed on, Commander! +Back in the base, didn't you say that the only thing we had to do was eat?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...that was the original plan, yes. +However, something came up at the last minute, so please lend me a hand.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:And you were saying that this was a banquet sponsored by food suppliers so we could relax and all... you're a big fat liar, Commander.
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The best laid plans of mice and men and all that. It's really hard on me too...
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:What on earth is going on? How is it that you couldn't anticipate it, Commander?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Explaining this part is going to be a little tricky... +Think of it as a bunch of troublemakers taking the opportunity to observe Griffin...or to be precise, what you're made of.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Hah? Shouldn't you just beat them up and throw them out? ...I'm just kidding.
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I wasn't going to take it seriously.+<size=35>After all, there's no telling who'd get thrown out if it actually came to a fight...</size>
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Who are these people? +Are they Dolls too?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Explaining this part is also going to be a little tricky... +All you need to know is that one of them is called AK-12 and the other is called AN-94.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Why is explaining everything so tricky? +You're not trying to pull a fast one over me, are you?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The less you know about the two of them, the better. That's the truth.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:But I remember those names... +The people who came back from the beach last time said that they encountered some weird Dolls.
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Much as I hate to admit it, they are, in fact, the same duo from back then.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Why does it sound like they keep showing up when we're having fun...
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Yeah, why is that... all I can say is that it was a good thing I arranged for insurance beforehand this time round...)</color>+It doesn't matter why they're here. The important thing is that they finally picked something to do where nobody's going to get hurt!
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:That sounds terrible...
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So... are you any good at Texas Hold 'Em? +If not, I'll just have to find someone else.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:I've never played it before...but since you asked me first, how could I pass up this chance to others? +Will you reward me if I win, Commander?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... +About that...we can carefully explore the details of each and every possibility.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:It's a deal, then. If I win... +...
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? Why are you covering your face all of a sudden? +Also, please don't pluck the flowers in the venue.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:... +There are some things you shouldn't make a girl say!
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem, we can carefully explore the details of each and every possibility.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:We're going to explore them, all right. +It's just a game of cards! Watch me master it!
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I suppose having such confidence is a good thing. +...+Oh yes, Gr G28...if you need an extra helper, she's over...
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Huh? What? Who?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+No, it's nothing. Pretend that I never said anything. +Just think of it as I believe in you to the point where I think of assistance as unnecessary.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm? +Well, if you say so, Commander. I'll go and prepare now!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+If they really end up meeting...she'll probably find out on her own...

()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:What's the matter? It's your turn again. +I hope you don't disappoint me, considering you said you'd turn the tables next time.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>139</BIN>:(Whimpers) +I... I'll check.
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't mind if I do, then. +I raise 1000.

G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:I... I fold.
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Giving up so soon? How boring. +Show your hand, AN-94.
AN94(10)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:A pair of 9s.
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I only have a pair of 5s. +You win this round, AN-94.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;AK12(11)||:So the two of you...only had a pair each? +Then if I hadn't folded just now...
G28(6);AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:If you had been willing to bet everything you had, you would have won this round. +Nothing ventured, nothing gained. That's perfectly normal, isn't it?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;AK12(11)||:...You're cruel! +You leverage on your huge stack of chips and place huge bets every round, how are we supposed to fight back against that?
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Isn't it only natural to make full use of any advantage you have? +It doesn't matter to me one bit that you have no assets worth fighting for on the table.
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Ughh... If only MDR hadn't messed up the game earlier...
K2(4);G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:The worst part is that she spoiled the game and ran off, leaving us with a huge mess to clean up. +Honestly...how can we end up losing to them because of this!
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;G28(6)||:But now we have no choice. +Even if we don't count the round where MDR cheated, M99 was forced to retire in the end. +And now the stakes have risen again...we'll probably dig ourselves further into the hole if it's just the two of us...
K2(4);G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:<size=34>Should we cheat too?</size>
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;G28(6)||:<size=34>How could we?! What are you thinking!</size>
K2(4);G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:(Groans) The Commander must've thought up a lavish reward for us, how could we be such disappointments?!
K2(4)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;G28(6)||:If only we could find another person, we might have a chance... +But where are we going to find someone who's willing to stand up against those two...
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Watch me. We've got lots of people here tonight, so surely we'll be able to find someone. +You two don't mind, right?
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Not at all.
AN94(10)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:The difference between us is such that it doesn't matter who Griffin adds.

HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:It's nothing.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(I knew it!)</color> +I call.
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...

AN94(10)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:We'll open the river, this is the last card.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:And the fifth card— +Is a 10 of Spades. +That makes a 4 of Hearts, a 9 of Spades, a 10 of Spades, a Jack of Spades and a Queen of Spades.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<震屏>:...ARGHHHH!
G28(6);AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Pffft. +Cards like these are very suitable for a showdown. +Let me guess, given that you've hung in there until the very end, that means you've got four to five cards of the same suit. +Or perhaps...a straight flush?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;AK12(11)||:So what about it? Are you going to admit I won?
G28(6);AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then I'll level with you. I have a King of Spades in the hole.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;AK12(11)||:That's...a bigger flush than mine... +Ugh...
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm going all in, devochka in the white dress...and Miss Edelweiss.
HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:I fold.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Huh? Even Miss Edelweiss is—
AK12(11)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's down to the two of us. +If you think your odds are better than those of Miss Edelweiss, then go ahead and bet. +What happens tonight is up to you, devochka.

G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:...Why are you leaving the hall to look for me at a time like this? +Your friend's still on stage, isn't she?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:I don't get it, Miss Edelweiss... +You could have won if you had kept that card!
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:There's no why to it. I discarded it because I felt like it. +Putting your friend on the bottom was just an unexpected consequence.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:But AK-12 was bluffing that she had the card. If you had chosen not to fold back then—
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:Then it would have been simply because AK-12 guessed that I would fold. +And that's the end of the matter.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:... +Are you going back?
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:I've done what I came to do. +According to what she said, the time for relaxation should be over now.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:Before you go...could you please hear me out one last time?
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:...Make it snappy.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:While I don't know why I can't remember if I've ever seen you before...you feel very familiar to me, Miss Edelweiss... +I don't know why, but I keep thinking of my stubborn big sister...
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:Ah, I'm not saying you're stubborn or anything, Miss Edelweiss! +And you're much prettier than my memories of her in my neural cloud!
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:I will take that as a compliment for the time being.+...+Where's your big sister, then?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:I don't know either... +One day, a long time ago, she suddenly said that she needed to carry out a very important mission, and she never came back to the base again. +Maybe she's still being a Tactical Doll somewhere out there... I think.
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:Is that all you remember?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:Mm...it sounds strange. I'm clearly a Doll, but when I think back about her, it feels like I've gotten amnesia. +Even when I want to find out where she went, I can't find her in the archives or the neural cloud records.
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:That's good.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:That's not good! +If I hadn't met you by chance here tonight, I feel like I could have forgotten that I even had a sister.
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:Do you miss her? +She might have hurt you in many immature ways, and yet you still miss the idealized image of her in your imagination.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:If all that's left of her are good memories, then doesn't that mean the time I spent with my sister were good times?
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:You should keep that to yourself. It's not up to me to supply my opinion.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:... +Miss Edelweiss.
G28(6);HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||:You said "one last time".
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;HK416(4)||:If, in the future... +You happen to run into someone who looks like my big sister, or a stubborn Doll whose Imprint is similar to ours, could you pass on a message?
HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay>:...+What message?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Nein...it's fine. Forget I asked. +Just take it that neither of us will ever meet her again. +Maybe that's best for all of us.
HK416(4)<Speaker>Miss Edelweiss</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,0.8</白屏1>:Then I'll take that as an "I'm doing fine, I hope you are too." +I'll tell her that if I run into her.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G28? +Are you alright? Why are you standing here by yourself? +Don't be that way just because you lost a card game, it's scary.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Commander? +Oh...that's right... +I didn't win in the end...so there's no reward for me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Who says that you need to come in first in order to get a reward? +Ahem...the proposals I researched aren't that limited! +There's a few that I'd like to recommend to you too, want to hear them?
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Mm...never mind.
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? +I thought you'd want me to praise your dress tonight or something...
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:I don't need that anymore. +But in exchange, could you tell me some things about the past?
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I might have to make things up if my memory's unclear, you know.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:That's fine too. I just want to know a little more about what I didn't know before.
G28(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So what do you want to know? +I can tell you anything that isn't classified.
G28(6)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Commander, do you know a Doll called "Miss HKM" and "Miss 4"?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:HKM...4? +416? +...+Ah...+Ah! I know nothing! I don't know anything.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Gr G28 plucks a flower from a nearby shrub and hides her expression with it.
()<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:If you don't know, then never mind. +But at least...knowing that someone remembers her is enough for me.
