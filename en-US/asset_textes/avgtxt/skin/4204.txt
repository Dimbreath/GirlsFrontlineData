()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Thanks for your hard work.</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Understood. +How long will it be until you arrive, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I might only be able to make it by nighttime.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Until then, I'll leave things to you.</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Got it.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission ends.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:... +...I know this is part of my job. +But I didn't expect to have to take charge of everything, considering I have no experience at all.
()||:While she has no intention of disobeying the Commander's orders, JS9 still has her doubts about them. +She has no experience organizing a furniture expo. In fact, she hasn't even been to one before.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:That's why I hate doing things outside my job scope...
()||:Still, it's unavoidable. +It is a last-minute job, so the team is severely understaffed. +JS9 isn't the only one doing something that they're not used to - so are many others.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I have to do this...
()||<黑点1>:In any case...let's head out and see what everyone else is doing.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点2>:It's chaos out there... Come to think of it, hardly anyone else has relevant experience, not just me. +They don't know what they should be doing now, do they?
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Hm? JS9? +Are you here to check on things?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Yeah... We're going to open soon, so I want to take a look at how everything is going.
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:I see. So, do you have any wisdom you'd like to pass down?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Wisdom? No...no I don't, I don't know anything about this either. +Er... Well, no matter what happens, make sure to keep your energy levels up. T91 should be around in a bit to deliver our supplies.
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:... +Mm, I understand. Thank you.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What on earth am I saying...</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Oh, Gr MG36! +Remember to use a trolley when moving heavy items!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Roger! +...But isn't that a given? I can't move big pieces of furniture by myself.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:...You have a point. +Ah, EM-2, don't tip your chair back!
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Sorry~
()||:All of JS9's pointers are essentially about trivial things.+The Dolls are all busy with their own tasks and can only take JS9's advice as a sign of her concern, but the truth is she isn't helping at all. JS9 knows that only all too well.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:What on earth am I doing... +This is why I hate doing things beyond my capabilities.
()||:I'd expected something like this would happen when this assignment was dumped on my lap. +I can't do what I can't do. That's just simple logic. +The more capable you are, the more responsibility you have to bear, which means on the flip side, you shouldn't bite off more than you can chew, right?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:At this rate...this furniture expo is going to be finished before it even begins.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:A transmission comes through.
MG34(2)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello? Is this JS9?</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:JS9 here, I copy.+What's the matter, MG34?
MG34(2)<Speaker>MG34</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've started letting the customers in, there's a bunch of interested people here already.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I couldn't keep them outside because there are quite a lot of them and they've been waiting for a while already.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>They would probably be really displeased if I kept them here any longer...</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:What? But we haven't finished setting up all the furniture in the venue hall yet. +Oh no...
()||:JS9 looks at the exhibition hall. It's still a mess. +Even DP-12, the most reliable one of them all, seems utterly at a loss about what to do with the furniture.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:...
()||:I can't just give up here, or this exhibition is really going to be a failure.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Right. I'll think of something on my end. +Keep on doing your thing.
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I haven't finished setting up yet and they're already letting the guests in...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Now where should I put this big cabinet?</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Sorry, DP-12. Do you have something that needs putting away?+I'll come over in a bit to help you, so please hang in there!
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'll be fine, just leave this place to me.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Also, relax, JS9.</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Is my anxiety so apparent?
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's quite obvious to me, at the very least.</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not cut out for this...
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We'll only know that once this mission is over.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Until then, do the best you can. I'll be with you too.</color>
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Alright... I feel a little more at ease now.+See you later!
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>See you later, JS9.</color>
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:The transmission ends.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:...What should I do now?
()||:Though she's feeling somewhat more motivated, she still has no idea what she should do next.+Just as JS9 is wavering indecisively, the first batch of customers enter the hall.
()<Speaker>Passerby A</Speaker>||:They said this was a Chinese furniture expo, so I came over to take a look... +But what is this, did they just open up a warehouse and start selling the contents?
()<Speaker>Passerby B</Speaker>||:Don't say that. +Warehouses have very sophisticated storage systems in place. After all, they need to put as many things as they can inside, but they don't want to damage the goods, right? +Comparing this place to a warehouse would be an insult to the professionalism of the warehouse staff.
()<Speaker>Passerby C</Speaker>||:Hm... Did they put that screen in backward?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +It's over...
()||:JS9 takes a deep breath. +The customers' discussion resounds in JS9's heart like the tolling of a bell.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:...What nonsense am I talking, we've only just begun. +Granted, not biting off more than I can chew is my motto. +But I hate giving up halfway even more.
()||:Still, what should I do? +If the furniture arrangement isn't good enough, then I simply need to pay more attention to that, right? +But then, how should I arrange it to please the customers' sense of aesthetics?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:...Hm?
()||:JS9 notices that EM-2 is surrounded by customers. Drops of sweat are forming on her forehead and she seems to be trying to tinker with her phone.
()<Speaker>Passerby A</Speaker>||:What's she fiddling with?
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Huh? Where did all these people come from... +But I haven't fixed the phone yet, and I haven't researched the furniture either...
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:So there's something wrong with her phone, huh... +No, more importantly...
()||:JS9 takes in the furniture strewn messily around EM-2.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I see... I think I saw a layout diagram like this before.
()||:JS9 quickly consults her neural cloud.+She suddenly recalls a painting of maidservants from ancient China, and the contents of the painting are quite similar to the scene before her now.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I see... +EM-2, what are you setting up here?
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:JS9! I...
()||:JS9's arrival is like the advent of the Messiah to EM-2. +Sensing EM-2's elation, JS9 can't help but feel motivated.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I bet you couldn't find any relevant info about these unusual pieces of furniture... +I know how hard this must be for you. Come, I'll help you rearrange your display area. +I just got a great idea from what you have here!
()||:JS9 skillfully rearranges the furniture.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:This is a screen; its purpose is to demarcate spaces and to block drafts from entering the interior.+I'll put it here and give you a place to use your phone.+This is a stool. You sit on it to rest when you're tired.+And this is a table, you can put your phone on it...
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Wow...
()||:EM-2 can only marvel in silent wonder as she watches JS9 lay out the display booth with immaculate precision.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:What are you standing here for? Go get changed.
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Eh? Do I have to change?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Of course! When conducting a Chinese furniture expo like this, the retail staff always change into similarly-styled clothing.+This isn't just to add to the atmosphere of the expo, but also to show off our professional standards.+So go change into your qipao while I'm rearranging your area.
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Got it. Is there anything else a salesperson ought to be able to do?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Hm... Well, sales isn't just about flogging your highest-priced products, but about satisfying your customers' desires to the best of your abilities!+That's very important, but you can't cram for it at the last minute. It needs to be learned over time.+Go change first. We'll start with a professional appearance.
em2(0)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:...Alright, I'll leave this place to you until I get back.
()||:EM-2 turns and leaves.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Alright... +Now, I need to figure out a way to make this place look better before EM-2 comes back.
()||:The pressure that was making JS9's head spin earlier seems to have vanished entirely. +She eagerly begins to lay out the display booth, and her practiced motions make it look like she's done this before. +She doesn't even notice EM-2 returning.
()<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:JS9, I'm back! +Wow— I can hardly recognize this place...
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:You came back just in time. Stand here and give it a try.
em2(2)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Alright. Wow, it feels totally different just standing here and making a call...
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Excellent, this is exactly what I was aiming for. +Since I've finished my work here, I'll go on to check on the next booth! +Do your best, EM-2.
em2(2)<Speaker>EM-2</Speaker>||:Sure thing, thank—
()||:JS9 hurries off before EM-2 even finishes her sentence. +She feels totally fired up now, like a locomotive at full speed. +What had seemed completely beyond her an hour ago is now a compelling challenge.
()<Speaker>Passerby A</Speaker>||:Hm? Hey! Take a look at this, it looks pretty good.
()<Speaker>Passerby B</Speaker>||:What? Let me see... Wow...that model looks so pretty...
()<Speaker>Passerby C</Speaker>||:I meant the furniture! This screen would look charming in my dining room. +But yeah, the model looks good too.
()<Speaker>Passerby D</Speaker>||:A crowd has gathered round in an instant... It's completely different from before. What on earth happened?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:As long as it's well-placed, even a single piece of furniture can shine in a different light. +They may not be used as they're intended, but that only unlocks their hidden potential.
()<Speaker>Passerby D</Speaker>||:Well said... Though I have the feeling you're not talking about furniture at all.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:You may interpret that however you wish, dear customer. I hope you have a pleasant viewing experience.
()||<黑点1>:Not only has JS9 completely shed her cares and worries, she even finds it easy to engage in conversation with the customers. +"The more people who need me, the more I can do." +That thought really puts a spring in her step.
()<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:(Groans) You're actually bowing... A-alright then, I'll let it slide. In any case, please fix it quickly!
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Sorry I'm late, DP-12...huh? Why's that person running off like that? +And is he having a nosebleed?
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:I think so? It must be hard to have to come out shopping even when you're ill.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:I don't understand why humans push themselves like that. So these items haven't been set up yet?
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, it's mainly this big cabinet here. I honestly have no idea where it should go.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ah, this one goes ...
()||<黑点2>:...
DP12(2)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Thank you for your hard work. JS9. You helped me out a lot.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You're making me blush... Don't mention it! I'd better go.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Apologies, everyone! This booth needs to be rearranged, so please take a look at our other booths in the meantime!
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:...JS9. Why are you in such a hurry?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Didn't you realize how many people were here? +Just squeezing in took me a lot of effort.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Sorry about that. So what needs to be fixed?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Now, this furniture...
()||<黑点2>:...
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Hm... Alright, let's lay it out like this. +What do you think?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:It definitely looks more orderly than just now...like something you'd see in everyday life.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Good. +I gotta go, so do your best!
()||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点2>:Under JS9's directions, a fever seems to have swept over the furniture expo and the number of purchases begins to skyrocket. The event is, all in all, a resounding success. +By the time the Commander arrives, the crowds are thinning and the customers have basically dispersed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I took the fastest flight I could to get here. +Still, I guess it wasn't fast enough. +I didn't make it in time after all.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Thanks for coming, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, thank YOU, JS9. +How are things?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:The expo went very well. +There were some difficulties at first, but we overcame them soon enough. +The number of attendees and our sales figures far exceed our projections. +Essentially, our mission is accomplished.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's still some wrapping up to do, right? +Let me help with that.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Understood. +We'll be counting on you, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You seem to be in a good mood. Did something good happen?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Something good?
()||:JS9 gives that a thought.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:No, I was just doing my job. +More importantly, I have more details regarding the furniture expo to report.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh? Alright... Go ahead.
()||:What JS9 doesn't realize is that her pleasure is written all over her face for all to see. +Although the reason behind her high spirits is a mystery, the Commander is happy just seeing her happy.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Oh yes, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:In the future... +I don't mind if you give me missions which challenge my limitations just a little bit.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah...
()||<黑屏1>:The Commander seems to have an inkling about why JS9 is in such good cheer. +After all...what else could be more gratifying than looking back and seeing how far you've come?
