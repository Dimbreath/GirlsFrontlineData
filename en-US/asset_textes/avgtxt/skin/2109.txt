()||<BIN>79</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I contact EVO 3 after my conversation with SAA.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker><通讯框>||:Greetings, Commander.+I take it something has gone wrong with the plan if you're contacting me for no apparent reason?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The operation's about to begin, so I wanted to check in on you.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Everything's fine over here so far.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, good...
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Anything else you want me to keep in mind?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your teammates for this operation are very good at causing a ruckus, and they might not be so good at cooperating with each other...
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Is that what you were concerned about? Don't worry about it.+I've been able to work very well with Skorpion in the past, so I doubt I'll have trouble with other people.+Also...I trust my teammates. If anything goes wrong at any step of the way, I'll do my best to make up for it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then I'll take your word for it.+Thank you for your hard work. I look forward to hearing the good news from your team.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1><黑屏2>:The mission begins.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:EVO 3 blocks the path of Welrod and her group as they try to escape with the jewel.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:I am the one you should be concerned about, not Welrod.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||:Urgh...EVO 3!+Why is it that even you have become an incarnation of evil!?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Calm down, Welrod.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||:Why don't you give up what you're doing? There's three of us and only one of you.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Haha, you do have a point. One against three certainly isn't very favorable.+In that case, I'll be making my retreat~
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Stop! Hold it right there!+I won't let a single evildoer out of my sight!
()||<黑点2>:Welrod chases after EVO 3 after entrusting the jewel to Grizzly and Zas.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||:EVO3! Stop or I'll shoot!
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:You're just as persistent as I thought you would be, Welrod.
EVO3(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:EVO3 stops in her tracks and turns to face Welrod.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:But that's perfect for me.+Because now I can deal with you alone.
Welrod(2)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||:Do you really think you can bluff your way out, EVO 3?
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Of course not.
()||:Just as EVO 3 finishes her sentence, two fire doors slam down to trap Welrod between them.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:I'm a phantom thief now, so I need to act the part.+Sorry, Welrod.
维尔德()<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||:But you're clearly a Griffin Doll! Why are you doing something so wicked!?
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Because it's my mission, Welrod.+Neither of us will walk away unscathed if we clash head-on.+I'd rather not fight you at all, so be a good girl and sit tight. Someone will be along to let you out once everything is over.
维尔德()<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker>||:Damn it...!
()||:EVO 3 pays no more attention to Welrod and swiftly leaves the area.+She soon meets up with her teammate.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:What's the situation, DSR?+Do you have the jewel?
DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||:I have it.+Take it and go. I'll handle the other nuisances.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I'll leave that to you, then.
EVO3(2)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Whew...at this point we're pretty much in the...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:...?!
()||:A shadow darts behind EVO and knocks her to the ground.
EVO3()<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Urgh...+(How...did I not notice...)
UMP45(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Thank you. Your part ends here.
UMP45(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:An unfamiliar Doll in a purple dress stands before EVO 3.
EVO3()<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:You're...+That face...that scar...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Thanks for your hard work. I'll be taking the jewel now.
EVO3()<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:How could I let you...
UMP45(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Have a good rest, missy from Griffin.+By the time you wake up, my face and what just happened...+Everything will be wiped from your memory.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The next day.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:Griffin Control.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...And that concludes my report of the mission, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, EVO 3.+I'll accept your report.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:However...it's very strange.+I should have left with the jewel in hand, but I can't remember anything after meeting up with DSR...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No matter. You've already done very well.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:The jewel was stolen in the very end...after making a promise like that to you...+I sincerely apologize...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:EVO 3, the most important thing in this mission is not the jewel.+Seeing your performance in dealing with an unexpected situation is far more valuable to me.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:But what about the client...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The company is already handling it with the client.+So there's nothing for you to worry about... Trust me, okay?
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:How very...you of you, Commander.+Very well, I won't pry any further into this matter.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good.+Although it is quite regretful that you couldn't join in on the anniversary party, EVO 3.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||:Well...I'm satisfied enough just to be able to wear this dress while working alongside you, Commander.+If we're just talking about a celebration, then we still have next year and many other occasions.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I'll be counting on you for another year, EVO 3.
EVO3(0)<Speaker>EVO 3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No problem, Commander.+Please continue to look after me as well.
