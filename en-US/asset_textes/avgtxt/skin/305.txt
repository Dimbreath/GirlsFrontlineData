()||<BIN>81</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:The Christmas ball went on late into the night. +Most exhausted T-Dolls have taken their leave, and only a handful of energetic ones are left chitchatting in groups. +I'm also feeling a bit worn out after a whole day of hard work, a hearty meal, and a few drinks in my system.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Guess it's bedtime for me.
()||:I get up and head towards the exit. +I only notice a T-Doll drinking on her own by the window just before I reach the door.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:SVD? There you are. +I haven't seen you the whole night. I thought you hadn't come at all.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:...You're still here, Commander? +Why are you still up at this hour? What if an emergency comes up tomorrow?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, it's Christmas after all. +What about you? Where have you been?
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Routine sentry duties, of course. +We could very well suffer defeat if we let down our guard during all these festivities.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Sentry duties? +How very like you.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Though I'm a bit doubtful, looking at SVD's Christmassy getup. +But I suppose...it's best not to rat her out.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you drinking? +I don't think I've ever seen this kind of alcohol while I was inspecting our stock.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SVD taps the plastic bottle half full of dark brown liquid proudly.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:This is authentic Kvas. Mosin-Nagant went to a lot of trouble to get it. +Since it's Christmas, I'll let you have a taste.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SVD takes an empty glass and pours a bit of Kvas for me.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm...Cough...Cough... +This is really sour and tastes a bit smoked... It's nothing like the Kvas I've had before?
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:The kind you've had was no different than your regular sugared soda. +You should learn to appreciate authentic Kvas like this one, Commander... +Come to think of it, it's not authentic to celebrate Christmas on this day either.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha... The Gregorian calendar is still the most widely used calendar after all. +I feel sorry about this, but I'm afraid you have to celebrate with the rest of us.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Whatever. It's just a day off. It's the same on any day.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that SVD's bottle is already half empty, I grab a random bottle with a bit of red wine left inside and sit across her.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Commander...are you challenging me to a drinking duel?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I wouldn't dare. I hear T-Dolls from your country are all very good at drinking.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Contrary to widespread rumor, we are not alcoholics. +Though it's true that I am pretty much impervious to alcohol... +You have to understand that drinking does not affect us, at least in terms of our performance in combat.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, right. I'll remember that.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:If it's not for a drinking duel, why have you sat down?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Drinking alone seems boring.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:I didn't ask you to join me.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SVD lowers her head and mutters to herself.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Bozhe moy... I didn't want people to see, but got noticed by the most troublesome person...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What was that?
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Nothing. +I was going to shoo you to bed like a responsible T-Doll, but then again it's Christmas, so I guess it won't hurt to let you relax for a bit.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SVD fills up her glass.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Then let us finish off all this booze. +Such lovely drinks on a festive occasion mustn't go to waste.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're right, SVD.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I smile at her and fill my glass as well. +SVD looks out of the window. +The snowmaking machines are still on, and the small square is gradually cloaked in snow.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:A presumptuous question, but was that your idea?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes. Those thingies weren't exactly easy to find in the antique market either.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:It was a commendable idea. +It would be a pity if there was no snow on Christmas Eve.
SVD(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SVD raises her glass to me.
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:Merry Christmas, Commander.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Merry Christmas, SVD.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:And thus SVD and I concluded Christmas Eve with a sharp clink of our glasses.
