()||<BIN>79</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:At the anniversary banquet.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:The guests are chatting amongst themselves in small groups, and the T-Dolls find themselves with no choice but to interact with the humans.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:They seem to have little issues with interacting with the human guests and things seem to be going well. With their guns put away, they can be easily mistakened for a normal human girl.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:And it seems like they will also come across common issues that normal human girls will encounter.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:WA2000 is over there...
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:WA2000 is having a conversation with a guest.+Her brows are furrowed and she seems to be a bit annoyed.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:...I'll go over and take a look.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:I head over and stand within earshot of WA2000 and the guest.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I can understand your curiosity, but this is a bit...
Guest()<Speaker>Guest</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Please, can you allow me to have a look?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:What I'm carrying isn't a valuable instrument or anything like that...+Not to mention, opening this huge case here isn't really appropriate.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:In her hands is a huge violin case.+T-Dolls usually carry their weapons with them unless prohibited in special circumstances...+So it's pretty easy to deduce what's in the case.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(It's going to be troublesome if the contents of her case are revealed... Guess I need to help her out.)
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hello, excuse me.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ah, Commande-
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:I raise my hand and motion to WA2000 to stay quiet.
Guest()<Speaker>Guest</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:You are...?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I am this lady's colleague.+I'm very sorry to interrupt, but we need to leave to prepare for her performance.
Guest()<Speaker>Guest</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Oh...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Thank you for your understanding. We'll be taking our leave now.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏1>:I pull WA2000 out of the banquet hall.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:（In the corridor outside）
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:We're in the clear now, WA2000.+We can sneak back inside after a bit.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I could've handled it myself...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I know you could've.+But still, it's very difficult for T-Dolls to refuse a human in that sort of situation, right?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...That person was really weird. He had to look inside my case no matter what.+I wouldn't have used a violin case if I had known that this sort of misunderstanding could occur.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I think that guest was just looking for an excuse to talk to you.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Why?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Did you tell him you're a T-Doll?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I didn't get a chance to...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:The guest must've thought you're a human.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Huuuh？
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:It's hard to tell the difference without being explicitly told, right?+Plus, going by human standards...you look very outstanding.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><震屏>:W-what!+Saying that all of a sudden... Of course I'm outstanding as a T-Doll!+But being seen by humans as... That sort of thing doesn't matter to me...!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>: Okay, okay. How about we head back now? The banquet is still happening.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...Alright.+But now I have to avoid that person... How bothersome.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Try to endure it.+We can relax at the base party after this banquet.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I'm not really interested in that party...+I don't think I'll go if I'm too tired after this.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:It's a party for you guys, so do whatever you wish.+But still, it's a rare opportunity to relax and have some fun. Are you really not going?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>:...Seeing as how you stepped up to help me with the problem earlier, I guess dropping by wouldn't be out of the question.+I'll consider it.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Night of the anniversary.+I see WA2000 in a corner of the bar at the roaring party.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Good evening, WA2000.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Good evening, Commander.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What do you think of the party?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:It's chaotic, loud, and terrible.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Is it really that bad?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Of course.+There's a mic-hogging tyrant and a table-flipping drunkard...+It's loud, and my neural cloud is about to explode from the noise.+Although I expected it to be like this, this is still too crazy...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:But you still came.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What? Are you not satisfied?+I only came to this awful party because of your invitation.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:No, I'm happy that you came.+But shouldn't you be a little more honest on this night of celebration?
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏>:I didn't come because I wanted to celebrate!+This party is full of annoying T-Dolls and troublesome things. Having to deal with them is enough to give you a headache.+It's just... It's just that I was bored being by myself in my dorm. That's all!+I only came here so I could grab some late night snacks. Don't get the wrong idea!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Alright, alright... I understand. But why not celebrate a bit anyways since you're here?
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:I pick up a bottle and pour two glasses of wine. I then raise my glass to WA2000.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:The past year has been remarkable.+Let's work hard again for the upcoming year, WA2000.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:WA2000 blushes a little. She presses her lips together and raises the glass in her hand.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You don't need to say...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Then...+A toast for meeting each other.
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:Cheers.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The glasses clink and I see a faint candid smile on her face.
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:I will continue to assist you by your side in this new year.+So...live to enjoy every day, Commander.
