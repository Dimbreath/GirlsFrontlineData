()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good afternoon. May I come in?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Da, please come in. +Dobryy den', Commander. How can I help you?
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...
PM(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Makarov, who is assembling something with her back facing me, is dressed very differently from the way she usually does. +She has obviously made a lot of preparations for this event.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Commander?
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry. My mind was wandering. +You look nice.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:So, are you here to take a sneak peek of my costume? As you see, this is it.
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I did come because I was wondering. +The costume is great. Very suited for Halloween. +Speaking of which, Makarov...
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Spasibo...hmm? +What is it, Commander?
PM(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Makarov stops what she's doing with a hollow metal ball and turns around to see what I'm up to.
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You...aren't afraid of ghosts, are you?
PM(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She gives me a long stare and sighs softly. Then she turns back to her prop and resumes her work.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you. I am not the slightest bit frightened of such things. +I have no fear for all things, real or not, invincible or not. +So please don't expect any surprise on my part at this haunted house event.
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(She saw right through me...)</color>+What a shame. I did expect a surprise, and I've been looking forward to it.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Then you should not have unwrapped the candy before it's time.
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Knowing thy enemy and anticipating their moves are important to any operation, right? +Besides, I haven't checked out your other friends who'll be there at the event. I still have many candies to unwrap.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:It's enough of a surprise if those idiots don't mess anything up. +Khorosho. It's almost time for my shift at the haunted house, Commander. See you later.
PM(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sure, see you. I'll look forward to your checkpoint, Makarov.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I told you there is nothing to look forward to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Half an hour before the Haunted House Adventure begins, Checkpoint 3.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I see I don't know you nearly well enough.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker><Shake>;PM(2)||:Eeeeek! Oh, it's you, Makarov. You gave me quite a scare.
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Should a T-Doll that's masquerading as a demonic creature be scared by a simple hello? +You're here early. What are you doing?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;PM(2)<Grey>||:M1919 gives her tactical tablet a wave. Makarov glances at it - it's covered in text.
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Don't tell me you are studying up on vampires.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Heheh, bingo!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You seem to put much more effort in your characterization than the others. +And your costume...is very well done, no matter how I look at it. +I'm sure you've been bombarding Miss Springfield with questions about your outfit, da? Miss Vampire?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Of course! +If I'm doing this, I gotta give it my best. +Especially at an event where I can scare people with no consequences! That's once in a blue moon!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Basically you only want to scare people... +But it sure is astonishing to see a wrecking ball like you studying quietly.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:See? You don't know me nearrrrrrrly well enough!
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Seeing how seriously you are taking this, I won't spoil the fun. +Do your best. I hope Miss Carmilla will deliver a big surprise to our patrons.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:You can look forward to it! +Speaking of which, why have you come at such a time? +Judging by your usual style, shouldn't you be solemnly guarding your post?
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:This is a recreational group activity. +I'm not as wooden as you think. I do consider it a good idea to cultivate friendship among colleagues. +It is always more efficient and effective to do the right thing at the right time.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Wooden is exactly what you are. Everything you do is based on cold logic...
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,6</黑屏1>:No, it is based on past experience...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Click)
()<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,3</黑屏2>:Whoa...! What's going on?! +Why has it gone all dark?
()||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:M1919 holds up her tablet for illumination. +Makarov is still standing silently in the soft glow.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:You're still here... Phew.
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Da, I'm here...
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,6<白屏1>:But it's time I returned to my post. Please excuse me.
()||<白屏2>0,6<白屏2>:The instant Makarov opens the door, something flits by.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Did you feel that as well, Makarov...?
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Something seems to have whisked past us...
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Have we made this sort of gliding mechanism?
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Not to my memory.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:You're awfully chill about this, Makarov... +Aren't you scared at all? What if something happened?
M1919A4(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Then we just have to stay with our post and play our part. +Besides...the point of the event is not the haunted house to begin with.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>;PM(2)||:You have a point. +Then stay safe on your way back! Don't trip!
PM(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Makarov flashes M1919 a brief smile in the eerie blue light.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Do your best, Miss Carmilla. +I look forward to the surprise you have in store for everyone.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:... +In the pitch black corridor.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Still, what really is the matter here... +Let me check the electrical room first. 
()||<黑屏1>:Light is shining dimly through the half-open door to the electrical room. +Before Makarov reaches it, the door creaks open and out comes a T-Doll.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hey, what are you doing here?
WA2000(5)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><Shake>||:<Size=55>AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</Size>
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Hey, calm down. It's me, Makarov.
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;PM(2)||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Oh, it's you... You scared the crap out of me. I almost shot you.
WA2000(4);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:"I'm an elite who specializes in solo operations." +Is that not what you always say? Then what's with that reaction?
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Shut up already! I'm not scared of ghosts. I'm just vigilant against possible enemies.
WA2000(4);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I did not say you were scared of ghosts. +But you aren't...very good with supernatural things, are you, WA2000?
WA2000(4)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Why would I be scared of ghosts? There's absolutely no way such unscientific things could exist. +Besides, I only just finished repairing the circuit. I haven't even turned the power switch back on. The haunted house doesn't have power yet, and the electronic ghosts aren't working, so what's there to be scared of?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:... +Da, that makes sense. +So...what is that behind you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:WA2000 freezes. +A few seconds later, she turns her head stiffly...
WA2000(5)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<震屏><黑屏1>0,06</黑屏1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:<Size=55>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Size>
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:WA2000 screams and dashes off.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:She runs very fast for a rifle T-Doll. +But who on earth fixed that projection thingy behind her? +It's only powered by battery cells. Interesting.
PM(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You really aren't even a little bit scared of ghosts, Makarov.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:It has never been part of my setting. +By the way, it was you who flitted past the door, wasn't it, Type64?
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:How unfortunate. +But it's even more unfortunate for the event... +Everyone has put so much effort in the preparation, and it's ruined because of the power outage.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Really? It is an event for scaring people anyway. +It can be considered a success as long as someone gets spooked. That's what I think.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:You have a point... +(Chuckles) Well, everyone did get spooked, except for the Commander... +Somehow that irks me.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Is that so? +That won't do.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Oh? +Got any good ideas, Makarov?
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:The event is far from over. It's too early to admit defeat. +Our setup is still in place. Let's resume the operation.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Sounds good, but how should we do that? +Should I mobilize everyone?
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Nyet, we won't have enough time for that.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:As she speaks, Makarov turns on a transmission channel.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Do you copy, M1919A4? +Right. Listen to me. I have a favor to ask... +... +Khorosho. I'm leaving it to you.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Pfffft. +That sounds really interesting. +I'm sure the result's gonna be great.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Who can tell before the plan is put into action? The commander could very well not fall for this.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Are you nervous?
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sorry to disappoint, but not at all. Let's just wait and see.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:After a few minutes.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><Night>:It's been a while, but nothing happened at all... +It probably didn't...
64type(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:<color=#00CCFF>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!</color>
64type(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:The Commander's voice comes through the channel.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>||:... +Ah... It worked. +What a blood-curdling scream. I'm even starting to take pity on the Commander.
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Khorosho. The operation was a success.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:That was a fantastic plan. +But only someone who's afraid of ghosts would understand the things that scare people. +You couldn't have come up with this idea if you really weren't afraid of ghosts, could you, Makarov?
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:It's almost time... Let's join them at the cafe.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type64</Speaker>;PM(2)||:Aren't you gonna answer me, Makarov?
64type(2);PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... That was just "a little surprise" for the Commander.
