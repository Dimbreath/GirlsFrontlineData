()||<BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Inside the photo studio building.
()||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:According to Helian's message...+Griffin Dolls will be the only other people taking photos in addition to our VIPs.+I patrol through the building in between photo shoots, keeping an eye out for anyone suspicious.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, nothing unusual on this side.+It's almost noon already... Hopefully this day will go by without incident.
()||:Right before I could finish my sentence, a staff member rushes toward me.
工作人员()<Speaker>Staff Member</Speaker>||:Excuse me, are you the person in charge of Griffin here?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, is something the matter?
工作人员()<Speaker>Staff Member</Speaker>||<黑点1>:One of the ladies from your company says she's not feeling well. Could you please come with me to take a look at her?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>80</BIN><黑点2>:The staff member hastily leads me to the resting area.+I see a girl sprawled lazily over a sofa.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...56?+(Her tomboyish posture juxtaposes against her wedding dress...)
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Ah...Commander!+What are you doing here?
()||:56 sits up straight the moment she sees me, but then immediately slumps back into her seat.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The staff member called me over.+You said you weren't feeling well?
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Uh...+Actually, I'm okay, just that I'm a bit hungry.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hungry?
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:I had to sit in the makeup chair for three hours, then they posed me around like a wooden mannequin, and I wasn't even allowed to move at all!+I suffered throughout the entire morning... Now my stomach's empty and I can't even lift a finger...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You seem pretty lively to me...
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:I'm running on fumes, Commander!+They say an army marches on its stomach, you know...+If this keeps up, I'm afraid I'll go into a forced shutdown...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I understand.+However, it's not lunchtime yet, and it'll still be a while before the delivery gets here.+I'll go ask the studio staff if they've got any snacks.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:They only have chocolate and biscuits and candy.+If it's not too sweet then it's too salty. I can't eat any of that stuff...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you've already asked.+In that case, I think you can't be THAT hungry, then.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Haaah?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If you were really desperate, you'd be willing to eat anything, right?
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<震屏>:Com—man—der—!+I had to wake up before dawn and I didn't manage to eat much.+These clothes are tight and heavy and I still need to make poses with my gun...+Surely there must be some benefits to such a difficult mission, right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, I was just kidding.+I'll see if I can get something for you from nearby.+However, there aren't many restaurants in this area...so don't expect too much.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Anything will do as long as it's not like the weird-tasting snacks here!+My stomach's counting on you, Commander!
()||<黑点2>:Some dozens of minutes later.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:56, I bought some food.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Uwah—! Thank you so much, Commander!+Lemme see what you've got! 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Slow down, you'll spill the drink.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Ah... Aw...+Burgers and fried chicken...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I knew this would disappoint you...but there were no other options.+Everything else was beyond our budget.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:...Alright. At the very least, these are better than those weird snacks.+I'll dig in then, Commander!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Before that—
56-1type(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I grab 56's hand as she reaches for the paper bags.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:What?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The staff member reminded me just now to tell you to be careful when eating.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:...Haah?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Take care not to mess up your makeup or get grease on your dress.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:What a pain in the...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not saying you can't go all out if you want, but you'll probably have to spend time redoing your makeup after.+If you delay the photo shoot, you might end up missing dinner.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Fine! I'll be careful then!+Geez...food only tastes half as good if you can't take big bites out of it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's for the sake of the mission, so bear with it.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Ugh, being a model is really tiring.+I have to hand it to those human women. You can't do ANYTHING while wearing a dress like this.+It's only been half a day and I already feel like I'll suffocate in this thing.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We all have a cross to bear.+Sacrifices must be made to reach our goal.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You're right...+We did accept this mission, after all, so all I can do is to bear with it...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:Type56-1 quickly finishes the food.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Whew, I'm alive!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You sure got a big appetite...
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:If not for this dress constricting me, even twice this amount wouldn't have been enough.+...What are you giving me those looks for?+Every mouthful I take translates into fighting power! I'm not the sort of person to eat and do nothing!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright...+If you're still not satisfied, then I'll properly reward you after the shoot is over.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Hehe, hearing you say that makes me very motivated!+Still, food bought from the outside just doesn't taste quite right...+How about this...why don't you try my cooking after we get back to the base, Commander~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh? Can I?
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Yup! We might not have as big of a variety as the restaurants, but I can guarantee that they'll definitely taste better!+And if you'll authorize the use of some rarer ingredients...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The chef herself will be cooking? Then there will really be something to look forward to.+As for the ingredients, I'll think of a way to prepare some for you.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Awesome! Then it's a promise!+As thanks for the meal you bought for me, I'll prepare my finest recipes for you, Commander!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Getting back to the topic, you'll still need to complete the mission first.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:I'm refilled and recharged!+I can handle anything you throw at me!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Seeing you this motivated puts me at ease.
56-1type(2)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Then...+Type56-1, returning to unit to continue the mission!+I'll be heading off first, Commander~
()||:56 swiftly rises to her feet. With her gun in one hand and the train of her wedding dress in the other, she stalks off toward the photo studio room.+She quickly vanishes down the corridor.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:She's a totally different person on a full stomach...+...+How will 56 look in the final pictures, I wonder?+I'll be looking forward to them...
