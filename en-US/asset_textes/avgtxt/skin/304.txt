()||<BIN>81</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Morning, December 25th. +I enter the banquet hall, where silence has settled back in after the hubbub from the previous night. +There isn't too much litter on the floor. Did someone clean up? +Just as I'm wondering who that would be, A T-Doll comes over to greet me.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Good morning, Commander!
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, it's M21. Good morning. +What are you doing here?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:A few girls fell asleep here last night, so I stayed behind to take care of them. +What about you, Commander? What brings you here?
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M14 asked me to come and collect the presents left behind by a few T-Dolls last night. +They'd be sad if they woke up to missing Christmas presents.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:I see. +I've already picked them all up and put them on the table over there. M14...is kind-hearted as ever.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So are you. +Taking care of the others all night. You haven't had much sleep, have you?
M21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M21 looks a bit embarrassed. She drops her gaze and fiddles nervously with her hair.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Ahaha...I'm fine. +I only came very late at night.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Because it's so cold outside, right? +And the dress you're wearing... I mean...
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Yeah. That's why I only arrived just before the feast started. +It was really lively last night, and the food was great. But I felt sleepy after eating so much so I fell asleep, and woke up just as it struck midnight. +Then I couldn't go back to sleep... And since I had nothing to do, I just put some blankets on them and tidied up the place.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You're more talkative than I expected, M21.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Oh, huh? Really? +M-Maybe I'm still feeling festive from last night, that's why I'm talking so much... Haha... +Umm... You haven't had breakfast yet, have you, Commander? Would you like anything to eat? There are some snacks and cookies left.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sure. Let's have some together.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:M21 and I sit down by the tidied table. +M21 soon serves up two cups of steaming hot milk and several platters of snacks.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Should we wake the others too, Commander?
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, let them sleep. Who knows what would go wrong with their Neural Clouds if we wake them too early.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, did something happen before the feast? +They looked miserable when I arrived.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's good that you came so late. They kicked up quite a fuss last night.
M21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I told M21 all about their attempted robbery on Santa Claus.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Is that so...
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Somehow you look...regretful?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Just a bit... It must've been really funny, right? +Ah, well... I'm not saying it's a right thing to do, but it just seems kinda fun...
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you like things lively, eh...?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Well, not exactly... +Oh right, Commander, would you like to hear a joke? Should I tell you one?
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sure. Let's hear it.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Since it's Christmas, let's have something festive. +Commander, would you be my Christmas?
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...sorry?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Then I could "Merry you"!
M21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...M21 bursts out laughing while making air quotes with her fingers. +...But then she freezes.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm sorry! That was rude of me! +I've always been practicing with a wall and I forgot I'm now telling the joke to you, Commander!
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Does telling jokes require practice...?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:I had wanted to make a few friends with it... +Looks like I messed it up...
M21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M21 rests her head forlornly on the table.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:M21? You okay?
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Why do my jokes always fall flat...? +I really enjoy hanging out with others, but somehow I just feel like I can't fit in.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:M21...
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:It was the same last night... +I didn't have anyone to talk to, so I sat in the corner all alone and ended up falling asleep. +Is my Neural Cloud...not suited to fitting in with others?
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't be silly.
M21(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I tap her head gently with my knuckle.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're talking just fine, aren't we? +Don't think too much. Just show everyone your true self.
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Hahaha...you're right. +I meant to tell you a joke, but ended up complaining... +I'm sorry, Commander.
M21(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I should be the one to apologize. Sorry for not getting to know you better until today. +I think as long as you sincerely wish to make friends, try to loosen up a bit and just let things run their course...
()||:Before I can finish, voices speak up from the other end of the banquet hall.
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Yaaaaawn... So tired...
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Huh? Who put blankets on us?
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Look, the commander's over there! And M21!
()||:The stirring T-Dolls come over and sit around us at the table.
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Wow, there's even a big breakfast!
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:M21, it was you who took care of us last night, right? Thanks!
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Your dress is gorgeous! Where did you buy it?
()||:M21 stares at the chattering T-Dolls around her, bewildered.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:See? It's okay to let things run their course, right?
()||<黑屏1>:M21 finally smiles and gives me a firm nod.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I've eaten my fill. +And I have some other things to attend to, so I'd better be on my way.
M21()<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Commander!
()||:M21 stops me before I reach the door.
M21()<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:I'll work hard and learn how to tell funny jokes... +Once I've come up with new ones, will you hear me out?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. It'll be my pleasure.
M21()<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Then I'll hold you to it!
()||<黑屏1>:I leave the banquet hall and the T-Dolls' lively chatters behind. +This year's Christmas has come to an end in peace and tranquility. +I hope they've had a taste of real joy in this short period of respite - +I'm sure I'm not the only human with that thought.
