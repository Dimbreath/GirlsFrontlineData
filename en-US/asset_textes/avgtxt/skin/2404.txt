()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:AK-12, do you read me? I'm picking up signals from other T-Dolls in this area.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Received. They're Griffin signals. No need to worry.</color>
AK12(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Understood. +...But if they came to recover our mission objective as well...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmm...that's definitely a possibility. No need to worry, I'll take care of it. </color>
AK12(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Alright. I'll continue searching. +Any further instructions?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nyet.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Feel free to relax and take a break. We've been given a very generous amount of time for this mission.</color>
AK12(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I do not understand what qualifies as relaxing. +Also, the time we have is not generous. We have other things to do.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
AK12(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Do you not think so, AK-12? +Then I will try to learn how to relax.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You can make your own decisions and think independently to some extent, you know.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What do you think relaxing is like?</color>
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Relaxing, hmm... The definition is "becoming less tense with respect to one's mindfulness or control of a situation." +Does that mean I should sleep? Carry out another mission? Adjust my operational tempo?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...A boring answer, as I expected.</color>
AK12(7)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But...a T-Doll's actions all run on programmed logic.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're right. After all, this isn't something that can be changed just by talking about it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I can see the Griffin Commander. </color> +<color=#00CCFF>See you in a bit. It's your free time, AN-94.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AK-12 ends the transmission.
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:My free time? AK-12?
()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Then what should I do now? + In any case...I'll continue searching in the water.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN>:AK-12, I did not find our target on the seabed nearby. I am heading towards the shallows to continue the search...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:(The shallows... Uh...that's also where those Griffin T-Dolls are moving around...) +(Judging from the nearby signals, there's a T-Doll with a human, as well as a...) +(Huh? There's something close by them... It's a...)
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +(It should be okay if I just go over to look, right?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...AN-94 tries to swim a little closer.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:(That's...)
()<Speaker>Human voice</Speaker>||:So it wasn't "helplessness" after all...
()<Speaker>Female voice</Speaker>||:Hmm? Were you saying something, Commander?
()<Speaker>Human voice</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:Ah, it's nothing, it's nothing. +On the other hand, I learned today that you're the sort of Doll who likes to explore the unknown, FAL.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(That's..!)
AN94(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AN-94 can see a white ferret draped lazily over a swim ring through the surface of the water.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(Is it asleep? Will I scare it if I approach it now?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:...After staring at it for a while from under the water, AN-94 decides to venture out of the water and reaches out toward the lazy ferret.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoaaaaa! What's this?!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(Ah! Dang it. The T-Doll spotted me first!) +(And I was so close to touching it—)
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Screams) W-w-w-what are you doing?!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...FAL reflexively raises her gun.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(It's all my fault... This shouldn't have been necessary!)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AN94 raises her gun as well. +The Commander sees the confrontation and immediately jumps in. FAL is pushed into the water from her swim ring.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:(Huh...? Why did the Commander...?)
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Commander glub glub blub blub blub blub... (Coughs)
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<白屏1>:(Ah, the ferret!) +(The ferret is sinking... Huh? It can actually swim! How is it so agile?) +(Since it's in the water...then...then I can...)
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<白屏2>:What are you doing, Commander?! I almost got water in my slushie! +And what was that just now?! Th-th-there was a hand—
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—It was a sea monster!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,0.6</黑屏1>:...Hah?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +The next morning, in a hidden spot near the beach.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...It felt really soft. I wonder if they're going into the water today as well.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you want to touch it again?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Nyet... AK-12 didn't give me orders to that effect. +...Huh? What are you doing here, Commander? 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't underestimate me. Finding a base like this was easy as pie. +Did you like stroking Fel?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Fel?
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's the name of FAL's ferret. At least, I think it's a ferret.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I...was wearing gloves at the time, so I didn't feel anything special. +But it was moderately soft, and I guess its fur must be very sleek.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I once tried to stroke it, too, but FAL wouldn't allow it, and the ferret itself also avoids me like the plague. +My... The more I talk about it, the more I envy you.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Back then, I just wanted to make sure...
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:FAL was frightened by what you did. +While everything turned out alright in the end, things were really dangerous at the time. You were both about to fight and all.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:It's true that approaching the T-Doll and the ferret was not part of the mission. I've already submitted a reflection report to AK-12. I made trouble for her...
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, it's not that bad. All's well that ends well. +12 should have understood. She didn't scold you, did she?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...She didn't.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You seem puzzled. She must have said something else to you, right?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12... +She didn't scold me. Instead she praised me for interacting with the ferret, and said it would be even better if I came to interact more with others through the animal, but I don't understand...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's very worried about you. What do you think?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I don't understand what she means. Maybe that's how I'm different from AK-12. +I was made for AK-12. She's the reason for my existence... +Leaving her and thinking independently is akin to disobeying orders.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Mutters) That's exactly what she is worried about. +And what did AK-12 say about this?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 said...our future was too uncertain, and that even if we were Task Force DEFY, we couldn't let the slightest chance go by. +But I think there's nothing AK-12 can't handle and that all I need to do is follow her plans.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If I were the one who told you that, I would very much like you to truly understand the meaning behind those words. +Have you ever thought about not looking to AK-12 for instructions and finding the best answer based on your judgment alone?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 once asked me to do something like that... +"You can make your own decisions and think independently to some extent, you know," was what she said. She also asked me to consider the definition of relaxation.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't think she'd actually say that.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But doesn't relaxing mean going to sleep or moving on to another mission?
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It is if you think it is. +At the very least, that's a conclusion you've reached, so you should believe in it.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But AK-12 said—
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While I'm not sure why DEFY is here, I'm guessing that touching the ferret wasn't something 12 had you do. Am I right?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...It was not. But that does not...
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you refuting me on her orders too?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:... +...Nyet.
AN94(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I think you've already taken your first step.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...There are still some things I don't understand. +Are the things I said in keeping with basic logic? +Don't tell me...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's still some time. Go ahead and ask your questions.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Nyet, it's nothing. Spasibo, Commander. I'm fine.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, it's about time, anyway.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Commander? I've been searching for you for some time now. So that's where you are. +Everyone's gathered, so may I ask if we will be returning now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, I'm heading over. Is everything alright with you, Gr G36?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Please do not be worried. I am in excellent condition.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right, let's go.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:After Griffin leaves, beside a huge rock on the beach.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:AN-94, how are things on your end?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:Ah, da, the retrieval is complete. +Although, after examining the surroundings, it would seem somebody tossed it into the ocean just yesterday, +Still, the target is in good condition, and I'm executing the storage procedure on it now.
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So this is what our higher-ups wanted us to dredge up from the bottom of the sea... This wreckage looks just as worthless as it did in the pictures. What's the point in studying it, I wonder? +94, is something on your mind?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:Nyet, I'm relaxing. 
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Relaxing, is it? How interesting, it seems you've gotten the hang of it.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:...Is this relaxation? It feels like it's affecting my efficiency.
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't just admit it...
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:Since you say so, it must be true, AK-12. 
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Honestly, aren't we back to where we started now? +You're such a bore.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:...Is that so? +The procedure is complete. AK-12.
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Alright, now all we have to do is wait for the other team to pick us up! +Did you run into anything interesting along the way?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:I met the Griffin Commander. +The Commander told me roughly the same thing you did, and asked me to think for myself.
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Quite an interesting individual after all. Looks like I was right about this human. +So, what do you think? 
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:I talked back at the Commander, and the Commander questioned me in turn. +My neural cloud could not predict the logical conditions which the Commander was using. The Commander's discourse seemed logically sound, but there were also paradoxes which I could not reconcile.
AN94(6);AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Isn't that good? +Do more thinking, AN-94. You're a cutting edge T-Doll produced alongside me.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(7)||:...But how should I do it?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I don't know. Isn't that every T-Doll's own business?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Understood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(But what is this sense of confusion that I can't quite articulate...) +(What is this concept of independent thinking, anyway?) +(I have no idea...but it feels like I've gained a lead towards it.) +(Will I be able to find the answer before I meet the Commander again?)
