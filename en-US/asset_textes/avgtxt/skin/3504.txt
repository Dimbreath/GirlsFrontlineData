()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【72 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Don't panic, QJY-88. +I still have 72 hours, it's going to be fine. +It's just putting together an anti-drowning device, right? That's simple enough...
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:If only if I had some inspiration...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN>:Two hours ago.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:...Right, that's all the intelligence we have regarding this mission. +Break into your assigned groups and get to know each other. +Dismissed.
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Rescue team... +But I don't know how to swim...
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Hello, QJY-88. +I'm Serdyukov.
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Hello... nice to meet you!
SPS(0)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:The Commander has informed me of your situation. +This mission isn't particularly challenging, and I'll give you some training beforehand. +So there's no reason to worry at all~
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay, thank you...
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><黑点1>:She did say that, but I feel bad for relying too much on Serdyukov... +I should still prepare some kind of contraption for myself in case of an emergency...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:【48 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I can't go on anymore. I haven't slept for an entire day. +I need to rest and clear my cache...
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:But I haven't even come up with the blueprint...
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:... +Guess I'll just hang on for a little longer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【36 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:ZzzZzzz...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88 dozes off with her chin resting on her hand. Her elbow starts sliding outwards...
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Whoa! +When did I fall asleep...?
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Oh crap, I only have 36 hours left! +Now I'm REALLY short on time!
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Time to wake up! Gotta finish this design already!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【18 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Phew... +Finally, some progress... +Let me make a prototype following this design.
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Only 18 hours left... Don't think I'll have time to optimize or even test it... +I'll just do whatever I can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【6 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:The anti-drowning device prototype is finally complete. Time to install it and see if it works.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The exhausted QJY-88 climbs onto the workbench and lies down. She picks up the equipment and studies it carefully.
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Hmm, at least the installation port fits perfectly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Her fingers slip and the equipment falls smack onto her face.
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Oww... That hurt... +I hope I didn't break it...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【0 hours until the mermaid squad deploys.】
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:QJY-88, are you there? +We're setting off!
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:ZzzzZzz...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Q...QJY-88? +Wake up, QJY-88!
Type88(0)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Hmm? +Commander! Is it time to go?! +I'll be right there...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...Now go and change into your battle gear. +After that, just head straight to the designated location and start your mission. +I'll join you later to check on your progress.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Serdyukov can probably do the job even without me. +Actually, she might actually have an easier time doing it without me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:QJY-88 peers at Serdyukov, who's getting ready, and sighs softly. Then she wanders off in the other direction alone... +She finds a remote corner and hides inside a large, unused crate.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:From there, she takes out her anti-drowning device.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:... +I have no idea if you're going to work... +I wonder if I should even hope that you'll come in useful...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She installs the equipment onto herself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【Anti-drowning device successfully installed.】+【Synchronizing...】+【...30%...50%...75%...】+【99%】+【...】 +【.......】+【Synchronization complete.】
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:It's installed! +Maybe it's really going to work!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88's eyes brighten, but the glimmer goes out pretty soon.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I think I'd just stay here after all. +Swimming is scary, and so is the sea... +If I really have to rescue somebody, this incomplete anti-drowning device is my only hope. +If it doesn't work, I'll surely become a laughing stock...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Ugh...I don't want to be laughed at... +I just want to be a part of them...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:QJY-88? Are you there?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Is the Commander...looking for me? +I'm really touched...that it didn't take the Commander long to realize I was missing. +Still, I'd better stay hidden. +If I'm found, I'll definitely get scolded.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:If they never manage to find me, will the Commander just leave me behind...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There you are.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>162</BIN>:Commander, I...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you doing alone in that big crate?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I don't want to drag Serdyukov down... +It'll be easier for her if she carries out the mission on her own...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have you talked to Serdyukov about this?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She was the first one to notice you were gone. +She's looking for you everywhere even as we speak. +She has even designed a life-saving course tailored specially for you.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:QJY-88, there you are.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'll leave her to you then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander claps QJY-88 on the shoulder in encouragement, then heads off to check on another team.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Serdyukov... +I was such a pig-headed...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:It's okay, QJY-88. +I didn't consider how you'd feel about your first mission in the sea. +I only focused on physical training and neglected to provide emotional support.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:You've already given a lot of thought about me as your new partner. +Thank you...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:I was just as flustered as you the first time I went on a maritime mission. +But you're better than me for being brave enough to show your fear and anxiety. +Back then, I put on a calm face but was actually scared to death.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:But instead of having a problem with me, my team leader had a lot of faith in me. +If it hadn't been for her, I would've failed that mission, and I probably wouldn't have gone on any more maritime missions. +Which is why I want to pass on the faith she had in me to you.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:But I can't swim at all... +And don't even start on life-saving skills... +I'm no good...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I was planning to build an anti-drowning device. +But I didn't have enough time. +And it's still incomplete...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:The fact that you tried to make it already proves that you want to accomplish this mission, isn't that right? +That's a good start, even though it may not have worked out perfectly. +Still, my life-saving training might just give you what you need!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Serdyukov drags QJY-88 over to the seaside.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...NOOO!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:...
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:QJY-88, open your eyes.
()<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Are we getting close to the sea? +The air smells salty...
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:That's right, I'll be giving you your first experience of the ocean. +Come, take a step forward. Can you feel the cool seawater?
()<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:What?! +Whoaaa! It's scary!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:QJY-88 brushes off Serdyukov's hand and runs off with her eyes squeezed shut in fear. +Dashing about blindly, QJY-88 steps onto an inflatable ball left on the beach and falls flat on her face.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>162</BIN>:QJY-88! +Are you alright?
Type88(5)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:This... +...is what beach sand feels like? +It's so soft...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:That's right. +Even the ocean has a gentle side if you just open yourself to it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov extends her hand again to QJY-88. After a moment of hesitation, QJY-88 takes it gingerly. +Serdyukov's hand is even softer than the sand on the beach.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Let's try it again, okay?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov gently leads QJY-88 by the hand to the beach where the waves wash ashore. +The cool water laps up the soft sand, rushing happily over their feet, then retreats just as happily back into the sea. +QJY-88 stares at Serdyukov in mild surprise, and the two exchange a smile.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Let's start our life-saving training right here!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:An hour later.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:So that's pretty much it regarding basic life-saving technique. +Now we should start patrolling to make sure everyone is safe!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I have accumulated a lot of knowledge about life-saving, but somehow I have a feeling that...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Don't worry, let's revise everything as we make our rounds!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I'll try to put everything into practice just to make sure I have it all down. +Phew... Let me refresh my memory... +First...we need to warm up?  +Then...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Are you very anxious? +That's natural. It also means you take your companions' safety seriously. +With this anxiety, you'll be extra cautious in the face of potential hazards.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:You mean... +Being anxious makes me more perceptive of hidden problems? +Hmm...that does make sense...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:What I mean is that if you can't stop yourself from being anxious... +Then simply don't consider your anxiety as a kind of hindrance. Make it your strength instead.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Make anxiety...my strength?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:That's right. For example, you were super anxious when you accepted this mission, worrying how you wouldn't be up to the task. +This anxiety drove you to create the anti-drowning device. +As I said before, that's a very good start.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Actually, this anti-drowning device is just an external storage module installed onto a swim ring... +But I did put a lot of thought into minimizing the size of the swim ring without compromising its durability... +And how to inflate it instantly when it's activated... +This is just the very first prototype attempting to solve these problems. +Which means...I never got around to actually⁠—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:QJY-88 faintly hears a shrill scream coming from the sea. +AHHHHHH—
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Did you hear that, Serdyukov?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Hear what?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:I think someone's shouting for help over there...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:You think so? But the sea looks very calm to me... +Let me check with my binoculars.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Serdyukov jogs back to where she placed her bag for her binoculars.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:QJY-88 stares at the sea in a daze.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Am I so nervous that my auditory system malfunctioned? +But that scream sounded so real...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:If I didn't mishear it, the only ones operating at sea right now could only be the investigation team. +Lewis is fishing by the sea right now, so that only leaves R93.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:R93's physical traits are⁠—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88 keeps a close eye on the surface of the sea as she accesses her neural cloud.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Oh right, pink hair like that over there! +Wait... is that R93's head?!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:What should I do?! +Should I head over to save her?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Serdyukov said... +I'm carrying everyone's faith...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...Deep breaths.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:QJY-88 closes her eyes. In that instant, the air grows still, the waves settle down, even the squawking seabirds fall silent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88 opens her eyes and dashes into the ocean fearlessly.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:R93! +Hang in there! I'm coming to save you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:QJY-88 runs on with the salty air blowing against her face and the cool seawater curling around her feet. Even the chattering seabirds seem to be cheering for her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She keeps running without a second thought, but her body suddenly starts feeling heavy, and every stride takes immense effort. +By the time she realizes something isn't right, the water already comes up to her chest. +The sudden wave of panic causes her knees to buckle.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Whoa... +Calm down, QJY-88!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【Anti-drowning device activating.】+【Warning – anti-drowning device activation failed.】
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:How come...? +...No...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【Anti-drowning device reactivating.】+【Warning: anti-drowning device reactivation failed.】
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Help! Cough, cough! +I...(gurgles)...can't swim!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:(Ugh... Is this all I can do...?) +(Even though Serdyukov put so much effort in training me...) +(But I still...can't do it...) +(I...must be a huge disappointment to her...)
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<Delay>:QJY-88! I'm coming to help you!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:(Ugh...Serdyukov!) +(She's coming to save me...)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Serdyukov! +I...(gurgles)...here!
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:I'll be right there!
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:(Is that what a professionally trained lifeguard looks like?) +(She's swimming so hard just to save me...)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:(Huh? That's...a crow?) +(Why is the crow carrying Serdyukov's bag and throwing stuff at her?) +(Serdyukov seems to be struggling...)
()<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Argh! (Gurgles) My... +...leg...is malfunctioning... (Gurgles)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:(Serdyukov!) +(...No!)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(What should I do?) +(The things Serdyukov taught me in her life-saving training...) +(Remember! Hurry up and remember them, QJY-88!)
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑点2><回忆>:I was just as flustered as you the first time I went on a maritime mission. +But you're better than me for being brave enough to show your fear and anxiety. +Back then, I put on a calm face but was actually scared to death.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:But instead of having a problem with me, my team leader had a lot of faith in me. +If it hadn't been for her, I would've failed that mission, and I probably wouldn't have gone on any more maritime missions. +Which is why I want to pass on the faith she had in me to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<黑点1>:If you can't stop yourself from being anxious... +Then simply don't consider your anxiety as a kind of hindrance. Make it your strength instead.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<黑点2><关闭蒙版>:(Exhales)
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:First, keep calm. Don't struggle or flail around, find my own balance. +Then try to keep my nose out of the water. Exhale softly, inhale deeply. +Now go around the drowning person and hold her from behind.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Right, I'm holding Serdyukov. +Now go to the surface again to catch my breath... 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:All this while, QJY-88 can sense the feeling of trust and security from Serdyukov as they slowly approach the surface of the sea.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:During this process, QJY-88 comes to a sudden realization.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hold on a second?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She stands up straight abruptly and the glittering seawater comes up to just below her chest.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two flustered girls make their way awkwardly to the shore.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment their feet reach the soft and dry sand, they slump heavily onto the beach.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Pff-Hahahahaha...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Hahahahahaha...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:That must've been... +One of the top ten ordeals I've ever had in my career, hahaha...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:No, it was all my fault...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:If you hadn't come and saved me, we'd both be lying in the repair bay. +I knew I was right to have faith in you~
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Ugh... Thank you, Serdyukov. +If it weren't for you, I'd probably still be cowering in the big crate. +I would definitely not have the courage to run out to sea... +Though we could both have...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:...I won't tell a soul. +In return, don't mention my malfunction just now...
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Serdyukov... Haven't we forgotten something...?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:... +R93 is still... +We've got to tell the Commander right now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:On the beach bathed in warm sunlight, the two flustered girls set off running hand-in-hand.
