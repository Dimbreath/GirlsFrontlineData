()||<BIN>18</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:In front of the event hall on the day before the anniversary...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:I should speak with M1918 about this first...
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Commander?
M1918(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:A voice calls out in front of me. Raising my head, I see M1918 standing there with her head tilted slightly and her eyes half-closed.
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Ah, perfect timing, M1918. I have something I want to discuss with you.+By the way, are you heading to the event hall?
M1918(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:M1918 nods with a puzzled look on her face.
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Well, SR-3MP went and changed the decorations in the event hall...+I questioned her as you were the one that was assigned the job, after all.+...Huh? Could it be that you already knew about this?
M1918(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>: M1918 doesn't seem bothered, and it seems like she has no intention of interrupting me.+I stop speaking and give her an apologetic look.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:No, this is the first time I'm hearing about it, Commander.
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:...You're not angry?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Why would I be angry?
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:That's, uh, well, because you worked so hard to decorate it...
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Eh?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:It doesn't really matter. I didn't put that much effort into it anyways.
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Not that much effort...huh...
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:If SR-3MP wants to change the decorations then let her do it. It's rare for her to have any interest in doing this sort of thing.
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:I'll leave it to her then, since you don't mind.+But is it really okay, though? I thought you were heading to the event hall.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:It's no problem. Someone as high up as you shouldn't have to worry about something so trivial, Commander.+Since the problem is solved now, I'm going to go take a nap... (Yawn)
M1918(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN>:Just how long have you been awake...?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏1>:Quite a while, but I'm alright.+Well then, Commander, I'll be on my way. I'll see you at the banquet.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:M1918 waves at me and turns around to leave, yawning as she does so.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>:...At the company banquet.
M1918(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:M1918 dressed elegantly in an evening gown inspired by the latest trends exudes a completely different aura compared to her usual lethargic self.+She gives off the impression of a mature lady as she sips from her wine glass every now and then.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hey. You're looking very different today, M1918.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(Chuckling) This is my "moment of truth", you know?
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:"Moment of truth"?
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:There are situations that even I won't treat so carelessly.+After all, for your sake, I will not let Griffin's reputation be sullied in front of outsiders.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:You are reliable indeed, M1918!
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:You flatter me, Commander. This is what a T-Doll should do.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I didn't think much of it from looking at the guest list, but now that I'm here, the pressure from being around all these VIPs is starting to get to me...
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Oh ~ ~, so the Commander isn't good with this kind of thing?
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(Whispering) Please don't tell anyone.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hehe, sure, Commander.+I'm feeling a little tired, though...+At an event like this, you can't just dress up and stand in the corner, you know~?
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yeah. I hope you'll be able to relax at the internal party later.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yes, if I'm with everyone else, I'll be able to act like my usual carefree self...+I'm looking forward to it, Commander.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点1>:Me too. Keep up the mature adult act for just a while longer, I know you can do it.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the party that night.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Skorpion and SR-3MP, both dressed gorgeously, seem to be arguing about something while the Commander is sandwiched between the two, smiling helplessly.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I will never hand the title of “The Party's Most Dazzling T-Doll” over to you!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hmph! It belongs to me in the first place! You must be out of your mind trying to take something that isn't yours!
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:As I open my mouth to say something, a T-Doll claps her hands and leisurely strolls over.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Okay, okay... Both of you are being really noisy...+Are you two competing to be the noisiest T-Doll here tonight?
M1918(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:M1918 winks at me with a relaxed expression on her face.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:M1918! Perfect timing!+You're old and know better, so tell us if I'm prettier, or if this lewd bunny is!+Quick, tell us!
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ah, well...+Both of you are very pretty.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Aaaaaaah no, no, no! You can't just say both are pretty!+I refuse to be put together with this tomboy!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh? Looks like you really want to get rid of that frizzy hair, huh?
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You're forbidden from using your grenade here, okay?+It'll be a big mess and a hassle to clean up.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Then, who do you think is prettier?
SR3MP(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Both of you are very pretty.
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Th-th-then let's change the question! Who's the prettiest?
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Both of you are the prettiest.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏>:I thought we said you're not allowed to say both!!!+We want a comparison! A comparison!
VZ61(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Well, you're the noisiest right now.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Uwaaaaaaah! You beast-eared people! You're teaming up to bully me!
VZ61(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I will still say that both of you are equally pretty~+Also, I've said this many times already, but I don't have beast ears.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:But...
VZ61(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Also, SR-3MP's bunny ears can be taken off. Haven't you known that since last year?+You should check if someone has normal ears before jumping to conclusions, okay?
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hey, stop pinching my cheeks! You'll ruin my makeup!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Wait wait wait wait, ears or whatever, that's not the point, okay?
VZ61(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh, really? Your hair accessories are even weirder than beast ears, aren't they?
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Is...it actually weird...?
VZ61(2);M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(With a stern expression) That reminds me, did you call me old earlier?
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M1918(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ah...!
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>: Do you two want me to join in on this battle?
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:N-no...
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Her cheeks being pinched) Wo.... W-wo... (N-no...)
M1918(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...M1918 smiles again.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Then, let's stop arguing.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Skorpion&SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...+(For some reason, they felt really tired and stopped arguing.)
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:All right, kids who don't fight are good kids.+Let's enjoy ourselves as much as we can before the party ends.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Skorpion&SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Silence)......
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh, by the way, when I was coming over here, I saw many people that wanted to take pictures with you two.
M1918(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>: Skorpion and SR-3MP look at each other, seemingly wanting to say something, but couldn't after being lectured by M1918.+With a big huff, both of them turn around to leave.+I look at M1918 and see that she still has the same relaxed expression on her face, sipping on her wine as she watches the two leave.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That was unexpected.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That those two children are so stubborn over who is the prettiest?
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:No, not that. I didn't think you would step in to deal with something like this.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Even though you may think it is a trivial issue, I consider this to be a "moment of truth" as well.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Just like what you said during the banquet earlier!
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>: A party should be relaxing and enjoyable, right? I just didn't want the atmosphere to be ruined.+Look, everything's all good now.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You're pretty reliable when it comes to crucial moments.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Not at all. I just want to be able to thoroughly enjoy the rest of the party.
M1918(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Looks like I've learned about something else that you'll take extra care in dealing with.+As expect of the big sister T-Doll. I must thank you for tonight.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:(Chuckling) Is that so... Looks like I've surprised the Commander yet again.+Though... (Whispering) I really don't want to be thought of as the big sister...
