HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Wake up, you sleepyhead! We have a mission!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Let me...sleep a bit longer...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We don't have to force her if she doesn't want to go.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:See? I told you she has no intention of getting up today.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Seriously, when DOES she want to get up on her own?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Whatever. 45 did say she can sit out on this mission.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Each of us gets a bigger share then, right?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Makes sense.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:I don't mind. +Or should I say, this will actually make the mission easier.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh? You think so? +I'll give you a minute to change your mind. Good luck.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:With that, UMP9 slips out of the dorm.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You...
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:416 turns and looks at Gr G11, still dozing in bed. She gives her a kick.
HK416(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:OW! That hurt! I said I'm not coming...
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Slacking again today, are we?
HK416(3);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I asked for a leave of absence. I need to get used to this place...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||:You know where you are?
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:In the Griffin dorm.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:You think you belong here? Think you can stay here forever? +We're renegade T-Dolls. +Besides, Griffin has no use for lazy bums like you.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I know... +But even for just a while, I wanna enjoy it...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:... +You're just hanging around, aren't you? Or should I say, dawdling?
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I...know where I belong... +...probably.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:That's your choice. +But I won't wait forever.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I can't be like you, 416.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:You're not being yourself either.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G11 buries her head under her pillow.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't know what you mean!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Fine. I'll let you off this time.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;G11(0)||:Gr G11 hears 416 sighing faintly.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:But Gr G11... +There won't always be a next time.
()||:Gr G11 listens as 416 leaves the room and shuts the door behind her.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I didn't...do anything wrong...right? +Yeah...I didn't do anything wrong. +All I need is some good sleep... +It's my holiday today... Forget about them...
G11(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:Knock, knock, knock!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm? Is 416 back?!
G11(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:Knock, knock, knock!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Is she in a rush? Maybe she forgot her keys...?
()||<白屏1>:Gr G11 shambles sleepily from the bed to the door. She opens the door...then regrets it immediately.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><白屏2>:Good morning, you're... +Going by the name registered on the list of residents…Gr G11, is that correct?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh... Um... +You're have the wrong T-Doll!
M1903(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before Gr G11 can slam the door, Springfield jams a foot in through the gap.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:My, may I have a minute?
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Ah, did I frighten you? I'm really sorry. My mistake. +I thought I knew every single person and T-Doll at the base. It's so unusual to meet someone new I forgot my manners. +Let me introduce myself. Springfield M1903. Nice to meet you.
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Um, I'm Gr G11. Nice to meet you... +<color=#A9A9A9>(Wait... Did I just give myself away...)</color>
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Hello, Gr G11. I'm here because we're doing an event for Halloween this year... +If it's possible, the Commander wishes all members at the base to more or less take part in the activities. +I saw a name on the list that's not out on duty nor given work for Halloween, so that's why I'm here.
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Halloween, huh... +I'm not particularly interested. It's my hard-earned vacation today...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Naturally, you won't be working for nothing. Like all battle missions, all T-Dolls who contribute will be rewarded accordingly. +Let me see... Do you like candies and snacks, Gr G11?
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Candies...! +<color=#A9A9A9>(Hmm... I haven't had any for days...)</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>(I'm running low on money and I'm not getting paid any time soon...)</color>
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Miss Gr G11?
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm... +If you have candies, I guess I could help out a little...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:(Smiles) Then we have a deal.
M1903(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh... I don't wanna do really tiring and troublesome stuff just for candies...
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(0)||:In any case, you've agreed to help, right?
M1903(0);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||<黑屏1>:Before Gr G11 can figure out what's happening, she's already being dragged along by Springfield toward the preparation site for the event.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:In a certain warehouse at the Griffin base.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Maybe I should've refused after all...
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Huh? But why? It's a rare occasion that only comes around once a year!
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You have come this far. This event is like any other mission. Deserters will not be forgiven.
()||:After Springfield brought her here, Gr G11 is caught firmly in the hands of two Griffin T-Dolls with no way to escape.
()||:One is dressed like a vampire... +And the other has a large pumpkin on her head.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:But I'm just here to get candies! I can go once I have them, right?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Looks like we have an open book of a T-Doll. +Why would there be any free candies in the world? They come at the cost of endless toil and labor.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Whimpers)
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's hardly that scary! +In fact, even though the preparation work is a bit of a drag, we're now having lots of fun playing let's pretend!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Fun...? What do you mean? +How could any work be fun?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Of course it can be! We're gonna scare people in the haunted house on Halloween! +Just imagine their reactions! Doesn't that alone make you excited?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Excited...about what...?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Heheh...
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Raise your arms.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:M1919, hand me another roll of bandage... +Hmm, something is still missing.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I know! Don't we still have that joke retractable knife that we couldn't think of a use for?!
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:You're right. If we fix that onto her head...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gr G11 whimpers faintly and helplessly as she's being fiddled around by the two. +...But after a while. +When M1919 passes a mirror to Gr G11, the latter stares at her own reflection with wide eyes.
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:She is wrapped in white bandage from head to toe. It's a rough job, but coupled with her pale skin and dazed expression, she really gives off the vibes of a living dead.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Is that...me?
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:That's right! What do you think? Isn't my idea ingenious? Vampire, Frankenstein, Cat Girl... +I knew we were missing something during the discussion. Now that I thought about it, it's a zombie! We can't do without the living dead in good old horror movies!
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Nods) Indeed...! The living dead is a must in horror movies!
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Ah, I see you're a person of culture as well! Care to join my ranks and become one of my spawns?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Even though the first-aid bandage is only a substitute because we've run out of cosmetics and props... +It works unexpectedly well. Probably because you have the right...air? +But just a reminder that we don't have much time left. The event is about to begin.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Ack! Have we spent that much time on her? We got too carried away...
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Um, may I ask, what...exactly do I have to do?
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Just lie in your coffin over there. When someone comes close, we'll give you a signal, and you...
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Listen carefully. You're our ace. The cleanup hitter and powerhouse on a baseball team. The final climax! +The zombie pushes off the coffin lid, bursts out of the ground, gives a terrifying growl and stumbles toward the screaming patrons! +Those naïve and stupid college students breaking into graveyards in movies will pay for their ignorance with their lives! +Ahhhh, blood! Ahhhh, innards! Victory belongs to the lucky star who holds on tight to her chainsaw!!!
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Who would understand such gibberish...
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I-I think...I get it! +(Balls up her fists) These scenes are literally unfolding before my eyes!
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:How unusual it is to find someone who's birds of a feather with M1919...but that's nice.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Not bad. You have much potential, kiddo! Springfield said you're Gr G11, yeah?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:J-Ja...
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:I'm M1919. We've only just met, but I like you very much!
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I'm Makarov.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Where have you been all my life?! I hope I'll get to go on missions with you in the future, or just have another chat. +But for now, let's take our places and prepare to welcome those brainless, unwelcomed guests!
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:R-Roger!
()||:Gr G11 climbs into her coffin in high spirits.
PM(2)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Let's get to our posts ourselves.
M1919A4(2)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Muster all your vigor and scare our visitors out of their wits!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Once the lid is on, the narrow coffin in which G11 lies becomes pitch black.
()||:Even so, she isn't the slightest bit uneasy.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Ah, someone is counting on me... And I'm a zombie... This is literally...THE BEST. +I can't let them down... Though how should I make my entrance? +Growling like "eeerrrrgghhhhh" as I stumble forward slowly the way Walkers do before Season 10 is pretty classic, but running around and screeching like the Berserkers after the Great Mutation is also very cool... +Sadly...I can't really do that...with this thing on my head...
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lying in wait in this small and cozy enclosed space, Gr G11's consciousness starts slipping away...
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:The gigantic Zombie King in the finale of Season 13... +Snore... +...
()||:When Gr G11 opens her eyes...
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hmm... I'm stuffed, Fraulein Zombie Maid... +So noisy... Let me sleep a bit more... Let go, 9... ACK! +D-Did I fall asleep? I'm still in the coffin? +Ah, I can hear footsteps... +Here it comes...! +Wait. How do I open the coffin lid again??
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Sheisse...! I promised I'd come in as the final climax!
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1>:…Gr G11 kicks the lid clean off the coffin.
MP5(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Just as G11 steps out of the coffin, a pale T-Doll dressed as a little pumpkin is passing right by, with another blurry figure pulling her along.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Gut. Time to start the party...)</color>+RAAAAGHHHHHHH....AARRRGGGGHHHH...

MP5(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Calm down, Gr MP5!
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...Huh?
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The T-Doll screams as she dashes unexpectedly towards Gr G11.
MP5(2)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;G11(4)||<震屏>:GO AWAY! GET AWAY FROM ME!!
MP5(2);G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoa! Aw! Ouch! S-Stop it... I don't like pain... Ack! Aw!

MP5(2);G11(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Stop fighting, both of you! +H-How on earth has it come to this...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The two T-Dolls wail dismally in harmony, until one of them gradually falls silent.
()||<BIN>8</BIN></黑屏2>:Griffin Control.
M1903(4)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I'm so sorry about this. I never thought this would happen. You must be feeling terrible... +Gr MP5 didn't mean it though. Can you forgive her for the sake of this bucket of sweets?
M1903(4);G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Sobs)
M1903(4);G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Holding onto the candy bucket, Gr G11 nods as she sobs.
M1903(4)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G11(4)||:That's a good girl. Then I'll be dealing with the aftermath. Just sit here and wait for a minute. +If you feel off anywhere, go straight to the Maintenance Room for an inspection just to be safe.
M1903(4);G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Sniffles) Okay...+<color=#A9A9A9>(Got thoroughly beaten up for no reason, but at least I got something out of it...)</color>
G11(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Are you alright? Does your head still hurt?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You're... +...Commander?
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You still remember me? +Hmm... I guess we did meet each other face-to-face.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You know who I am?
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. Gr G11 of "The Squad That Doesn't Exist". +That said, with your squad temporarily staying at our base and using it as a provisional stronghold, I can't pretend that you don't exist even though that's what it says on the tin. +I noticed that your friends have all set off on a mission, leaving you behind. I was a bit worried, so I asked Springfield to check up on you.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh... +All I want...is a bit of "me time"...every now and then.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If so, how about joining us over here?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...What?
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If that is what you want, I can convince others to let you stay. +Apart from managing the base and giving commands in the field, it's also a commander's duty to recruit competent members for Griffin.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Competent...? Nein, I'm not competent at all.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dear me, that's not something for you to decide.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:N-Nein... I...I'm not authorized to make such decisions.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If that's the case, you don't have to give me a reply straight away. +Why not talk to your leader or the one that's hiring you? Who knows, this probably won't be the last time we meet.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Even if we do meet again, you'll... Oh!
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G11 looks down at the candy bucket sitting on her lap. Her eyes flash sharply and she jumps up from her chair.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Um, Commander... What if everyone who participated in this event…gets their memories wiped...because I also took part...
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You are an off-duty T-Doll under Griffin while you're staying at our dormitory. You don't have to worry about that at all. +You took no part in your squad's mission, nor did the event have anything to do with confidential matters, so no memory wipe is necessary.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Trembles) But that's not it... This isn't something over which...you...or I...have a say... +I...I scared Gr MP5... I didn't keep my promise to M1919 and Makarov and dozed off at my post... +What if my incompetence causes everyone...to lose their precious memories...
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Okay, but even if what you say is true, and a memory wipe on you and the other T-Dolls is in order, it doesn't matter. +I won't forget that a special T-Doll called Gr G11 once took part in the Test of Courage event on Halloween at Griffin, because human memory isn't so easily deleted.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh...but isn't that gonna be weird?
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How so?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:If my neural record gets altered...and we meet again... +Won't there be two of me in your memory? The Gr G11 of Squad 404 and the Gr G11 of Griffin... +The inconsistency and contradiction...would be as if someone you know got kidnapped and replaced by aliens. That would be a disgusting feeling...
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In any case, both of them would be Gr G11. +All that matters is whether you're willing to be the Gr G11 of Griffin, don't you think?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Me... Gr G11 of Griffin... That isn't so...
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just as Gr G11 is about to say something, she freezes. Then her eyes start blinking rapidly.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Encrypted transmission...which means...)</color>
G11(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:(Thud!) By the time Gr G11 recovers, her candy bucket is already lying on the floor.
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:U-Um... Commander... I have to report for duty... +Something's happened...and they need me there.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your teammates are looking for you?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:(Nods) Ja. 416 is already on her way to pick me up. +I need...a place where I can always go home to, and it isn't here after all.
G11(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You forgot these! Don't you want to take your candies to your dorm?
G11(4)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Please give them to M1919 and Makarov! +And please apologize to them for me! I-I shouldn't have fallen asleep... +And...please look after the candies!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Gr G11 leaves behind her reward for tonight and dashes off in a rush. Her dainty figure soon disappears down the hallway. +I bend down and pick up the candy bucket lying on the floor.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Gr G11 of Squad 404 and the Gr G11 of Griffin, huh... +I wonder when the two can become one.
