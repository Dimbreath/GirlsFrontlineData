()||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Afternoon, December 24th. At a Griffin base.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm starving...
()||:I've been shopping with FAL the whole time and ended up not eating anything.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The cafeteria is probably still busy preparing for the feast right now... +Well, it's gonna start in two or three hours anyway. I'll just eat whatever to fill my stomach for now.
()||:I make my way to the vending machine outside the command center. The supplier is closed during the holiday season, but there should still be something left.
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:These...and these... Gotta take them all...
()||:I hear a T-Doll muttering to herself when I'm almost at the vending machine. +Her figure is obscured by a huge white sack. She keeps taking things out from the machine compartment and stuffing them into the sack.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait!
()||:At this rate, the vending machine will be emptied very soon! +I hurry over to her side.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please leave some for me!
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The squatting T-Doll looks up. +She's replaced her usual cowgirl getup with a festive red-and-white combo, but her fashion sense is still unmistakable.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Oh, it's you, Commander! +Stocking up, too, eh?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, SAA. What are you doing here?
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I'm not very into balls and stuff like that, so I'm throwing a small party with a few friends in the dorm afterwards. +Naturally, I need to stock up on enough cola and snacks!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...But emptying the entire vending machine seems a bit excessive.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Haha, it's always better to be as prepared as you can.
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I'm just about to disagree, but much to my embarrassment, my empty stomach chooses this moment to complain. +SAA fishes out a packet of chips from her sack.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Hungry, Commander? Here, replenish your energy!
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not the healthiest of food, but it's enough to sate my urgent need. +Besides...seeing as how much she loves junk food, it's incredibly generous of her to share it with me.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thanks, SAA.
()||<黑屏2>:I sit down on the bench and opens the packet of chips. SAA sits down next to me and pops open a can of cola.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Ahhhh! Cola is THE BEST!
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I know she's always been addicted to cola, but watching her chug down a can of carbonated drink on a cold winter day while dressed like this still makes me shiver.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't you feel cold?
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Heheh, people with a blazing heart don't need extra clothes to keep warm! +Of course, it's also thanks to the cola~
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA gives her can a shake.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:You should have some too, Commander!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha...Chugging it down the way you do would probably douse the fire in me. +By the way, SAA... You get along with the other kids at the base, don't you?
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Yeah, they're all great pals that I share my cola with! +Have you changed your mind about joining us, Commander?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I want to ask you something. +Are they planning anything special for Christmas?
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Special?
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, something like...an operation to obtain more Christmas presents.
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA narrows her eyes, as if she's pondering something. +But she quickly reassumes her usual innocent expression.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Huh? I'm not really sure what you're talking about. +The only special plan I know of is a party overflowing with cola~ It'd be nice with some chips, too!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...so they're really not planning anything?
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Plans with no cola are no plan at all.
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Looks like she doesn't want to give me a straight answer. +Just as I'm about to press further, we hear another T-Doll shouting from the square nearby.
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||:SAA! SAA! +We're decorating the Christmas tree! Come and help!
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Coming! Save me a spot to hang up a cola!
Grifon T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||:You can hang up whatever you like as long as it doesn't fall off! +Just hurry!
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I gotta help them with the tree, Commander!
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright. Don't let me keep you.
()||:SAA hoists up her sack filled with cans of cola and runs off, but turns back after two steps.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Oh right. This is for you.
M1873(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA takes a can of cola out of her sack and shoves it into my hands.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Whatever plans you have tonight, Commander, make sure you don't forget the cola~ +Well, see you in a bit~
()||:She smiles and gives me a wink, then joins the crowd in the center of the square.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought I could collect some intel from her... +She may seem callous, but she's a lot more cunning than I expected. +Still, I'm not totally unprepared.
()||:I haven't discovered any useful leads, but...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It will surely be a blast tonight.
()||:I open the can of cola and take a sip.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ack...Cold! +But that did jolt me wide awake. +Well then, back to work!
()||<黑屏1>:With great anticipation for Christmas Eve, I leave the resting area as SAA's laughter fades gradually into the distance.
