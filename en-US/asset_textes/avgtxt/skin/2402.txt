()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:... +...While it's not like I don't understand everyone's excitement at seeing the ocean and the beach for the first time... +The girls' response is more enthusiastic I had expected, and the way they keep dashing about leaves me feeling exhausted.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm so tired... +This is supposed to be a beach vacation, so why are there so many things to worry about... +Let me just find a quiet corner first... I doubt they're capable of blowing up the entire beach anyway...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:...I walk for a while into the distance by myself, in order to get some peace and quiet. +Just as I'm about to turn back, I see someone standing on a lookout point in the distance, gazing at the ocean. +I blink, just to be sure I've got the right person.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.4</CGDelay><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(AK-12?) + (What's a T-Doll from Task Force DEFY doing here? Could there be some threat nearby that needs a member of DEFY to handle?) + (Hmm... But she doesn't seem to be dressed for a combat mission...?)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +I've been hearing about this stretch of beach since I was a kid. It's always been a vacation hotspot. I just didn't expect to visit it like this. +Is this your first time seeing the ocean, 12?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It is, but it also isn't. +The holodeck I use for combat simulations left out a lot of details, so it's something of a surprise to me..
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +I didn't expect to see you here. I mean...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Why don't we talk about something more fitting to the locale? +You can see the Griffin T-Dolls on the beach from here. They are all such dorks, but that's not bad either, is it?
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't care about anything else. Just, please don't tell me DEFY came to the seaside just to watch Griffin's T-Dolls play around.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:If that's what you think, suit yourself.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Mutter) I don't that's the case, and that's what worries me. +I don't see AN-94 around either, and I have no idea what she's doing away from you.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Well, think of it as her learning how to be independent. +If 94 remains by my side, there are some difficulties that she will never learn how to overcome.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you can't reveal the reason why DEFY is here?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:It. Doesn't. Concern. You.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So you can make such a face too? How interesting.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm being very serious, AK-12. +I can let some things slide, but there are also things that I can't permit no matter what, especially things which could endanger the other beachgoers—
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:While I'm very curious about what's worrying you... +I can assure you that your safety and that of all the Griffin Dolls present is guaranteed precisely because our presence.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right now, I just feel uneasy.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's because your mind is wandering on account of being bored. +I'm also tired of sitting here and watching the Griffin T-Dolls play. +How about we play together then? Doesn't the Griffin Doll over there have a beach volleyball?
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not in the mood for that...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Alright, then how about having the losers do whatever the winners demand? If you win, I'll tell you what we're doing here. +You can send as many players as you like. If 94 or I lose even a single set, victory is yours.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Looks like you don't think you can possibly lose. +It's not like I don't understand how that could be. After all, you and 94 could handily thrash us all.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That's true. It's a bit unfair playing against such outdated models. +Tell you what, I promise I won't "open my eyes". How about it?
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Also, you're not allowed to hurt them with the volleyball. You mustn't damage their internal or external components.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,0.6</黑屏1>:My, you're strict... +All right, I accept. Let's have some fun. +What about you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The match whistle blows over the volleyball court drawn on the beach.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'll handle the first match. I'll be enough by myself.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Commander, who will Griffin be sending?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(That IS a very important question...) + (In any case, I need to find people who know how formidable DEFY are as well as the rules of volleyball...)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've decided. We'll have...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||<震屏>:Obviously Master's going to fight the first battle with you!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Huh? Gr G41?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The Commander? +Understood. I didn't expect my opponent to be you, Commander. Do show me a good time.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on please, AK-12. Don't take a joke about an ordinary human going toe-to-toe with an elite T-Doll seriously. +Also, beach volleyball is played with a partner... Didn't Ameli tell you that earlier?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:Go, Master! Show this weirdo who's looking down on Griffin just how powerful you are! +Everyone's going to cheer you on!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:D-d-d-d-don't push me, Gr G41! I'm begging you, just let me go and let me off!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're in position, Commander? Then I'll serve. +Let the game begin. Preparing to attack.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Huh? +Hang on?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||<黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1>:Go, Master! You've got to win!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,3</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...With a resounding smack, AK-12's serve sends the volleyball soaring over in a carefully calculated and beautiful curve. +It strikes me square in the face and sends my entire body flying back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...I'd be happy to keep the bridge of my nose intact, to say nothing of actually winning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><睁眼>:...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:(Sobs) +Master... I'm sorry...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm okay, don't worry... Please don't squash me like that. + ... +While it's not too likely, I'd like to ask anyway... +Were you trying to kill me with that serve?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Now, why would you think I would be possessed of such a base emotion as a personal grudge?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I guess so too...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Still, I didn't expect you to be out for only 20 minutes. Your body's surprisingly tough, Commander. Very interesting indeed. +Shall we continue, Commander? I'd like to correct my databases.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'd like to end this summer vacation on my feet, so please give me a break.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...The whistle signalling the end of all matches blows just before sunset. +...AK-12 returns to the lookout point after the matches are over.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So this is a human sport... +It was a little fun at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes boring right away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Looks like I'll never know why DEFY came to the beach now. +Still, since you had the time to play a ball game, I'm sure that you aren't here to take care of some urgent threat.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You can be sure that we only came here to watch the Griffin T-Dolls play.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It looks like I have no choice, so let's go with that. +Take this. There's enough for you and 94.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:A slushie? +We don't need consolation prizes from Griffin...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What do you mean by a consolation prize? Gr G36 made these specially for you after she saw the two of you arrive. +She even custom-blended the flavor, so hurry up and eat it before it melts.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...AK-12 stares at the slushie and gingerly takes a mouthful.
AK12(5)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN>:Ugh... Hnng...
AK12(5)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't like the taste?
AK12(5)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's not a matter of the taste. +I'm not used to eating iced snacks and my head hurts a little.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:So Dolls can get brain freeze too? +Well, I didn't expect the elite T-Doll AK-12 to have such a weakness. I need to make good use of this. +Soon, AK-12 recovers from the sensation and starts rambling on.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:An iced treat has to taste at least this good before I'd consider putting it in my mouth. +Now then, let me think about what I'll have the Griffin Commander do as I nurse this headache of mine.
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't ask me to leave Griffin! And don't use this to make me harass other Dolls!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I once heard there was a beautiful, high-ranking female in Griffin who had a hard time finding a partner... +Why don't you dress up a little and be her prince?
AK12(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No harassing non-Dolls either!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I was just kidding. +Commander, very few humans are this fun to observe, you know.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The human soul isn't designed the same way as a neural cloud. Interesting souls don't pop out of thin air. You could even say they're nothing more than byproducts of other things. +So when you meet such souls, do be kind to them.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I will. +In that case, I'll hang on to the prize for winning the match for now. I'll let you know what I want once I think of something good. +I look forward to meeting you again, Commander.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:After that, every time I recalled that summer day on the beach, the memory was accompanied by the pain of being smacked in the head by a ball. +That was how our world crossed paths with DEFY on the beach, and then we each resumed our respective courses. +At that time, not all the Dolls realized the true nature of the Doll with the closed eyes. Knowing is a good thing, but perhaps not knowing is also a good thing. +After all...both AK-12 and I knew that there's no telling where we'd stand or where things would take us the next time we meet.
