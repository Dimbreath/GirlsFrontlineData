CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:Yes, analyzing... Target identified, it's MP40's signal. +Follow me, I know her coordinates!
MG3(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:MG3 grunts in approval and rushes over to MP40's position along with Model L.

MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;MP40(0)||:Are you alright? What happened?
MG3(4);MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:My precious candy... Someone stole it!

CETME556(0);MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:I didn't see who it was...but she had a very big hat!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;MP40(0)||:Aw, that's no help at all. +There are tons of Dolls with hats today.
MG3(4);MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:Please, help me... Th-the Commander gave it to me.

MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:(Sniffles)
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Model L suddenly lets out a sigh from where she's been investigating on the sidelines.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:MG3, head to these coordinates. +Go and capture FF FNC.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Huh? +We can't just look for someone wearing a hat to take the fall just because we don't have any leads.
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Model L picks up a chocolate wrapper from the ground and holds it up to MG3's face.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:This...this is...
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:It's a wrapper from the chocolates that FNC is always eating. +If this isn't enough to get her to confess to her crimes, then hand it to the Commander to test the saliva on the wrapper.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:I see.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright! Leave the catching to me!
()||<黑屏1><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:In less than an hour, MG3 has seized FNC and returned the candy to MP40. +After that, Model L and MG3 solve many other problems caused by Dolls.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>2</BIN><Night>:...Phew. We sure did a lot of running tonight. Let's take a break so I can catch my breath.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:Yeah... I'm starting to feel a little tired too.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Haha, good thing I've got Model L as my teammate. You're as reliable as always.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:You don't have to lick my boots. I don't care about anything that isn't related to the mission or my orders.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Huh? You sound different from your usual self.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:Even you think so...? How am I different? +I've always considered my mission and my orders as my top priorities.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hm... Now that I think about it, that does seem to be the case. +Sorry, maybe I was just imagining things.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:...Today might be Halloween, but everyone's being a bit too lively tonight, don't you think?
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Well, it IS a festive event. It's times like these when you put your troubles aside and just run around and have as much fun as you can. +The joy you experience during the festival can serve as the motivation to help you overcome your difficulties the next day, and in all the days to come.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>;MG3(4)||:I'm guessing you're the kind of Doll who only starts writing your mission logs right before the debriefing, right?
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hahaha, you caught me.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||<黑点1>:After all, yesterday I...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑点2><黑点1>:Ah—! What the heck is this?!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Looks like there's another Doll in distress.
CETME556(0);MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:This is a pretty tough job. We don't even have time to chat.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Let's head out!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Do you know where to go?
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:That sounded like M870's, I remember how she chased me down on a motorbike and gave me a ticket for running on a motorway before... +So I can recognize her voice anywhere. She must be a participant in the test of courage too, and I know exactly where she'd be!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:...That statement is wrong on so many levels, I don't know which one to start with.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ow—! Mayday! Mayday!
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Looks like there's no time to rant about her; there's yet another Doll in trouble!
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Was that M870 again? +It sounded like the same voice.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:It did sound like her...but it's also vaguely different. +Aw, I'm not too sure myself, but I think that voice came from the other direction.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Really now... There sure are a lot of Dolls in trouble tonight. +You head over to M870's side. I'll handle the other one.
MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Got it. I'll send the coordinates to you. +Be careful when moving alone.
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Model L nods and heads the other way.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The cries for help keep coming, as though they were beckoning Model L.

KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Hm?
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Model L frowns and glares at KSVK.
()||:That is because there is a Doll collapsed at KSVK's feet.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:That's...P90 on the ground!+<color=#A9A9A9>So that was you... I can't believe you're still imitating others at a time like this.</color>
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Yeah...she accidentally passed out so I'm taking care of her.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Really? You don't look like you're taking care of her. +Rather...you look like you attacked her!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Now why would you think that? Shouldn't we all get along since we're both Griffin Dolls?
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:The precondition for getting along with you is...that you're actually a friend.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Have I offended you in some way? I can't believe you're doubting my very identity.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Could you show me your left hand?
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Hm? That's part of my Halloween costume; taking it off would be very troublesome.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:I'm not talking about your costume. Today is Halloween, and there might be someone out there disguising themselves as another Doll as some kind of practical joke... +Show me your left hand. If you're the real KSVK, your left hand will definitely—

KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I didn't expect you to be so perceptive, Miss Model L.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:(Groans) As I thought, you're not KSVK!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Come see for yourself if I am KSVK or not.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:KSVK unwraps the bandages on her left arm. +It looks just like how Model L remembers it.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:How could this be...? Your left arm's the same as KSVK's... +But KSVK would never attack a friend!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I didn't do anything to her... I merely "paid her back".
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Payback?
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Her karate chop from earlier HURT, by the way.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:And am I going to receive some of your payback too?
KSVK(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:KSVK shakes her head.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I have no grudge against you, but for a minute there, I was worried you would ruin my plan. +Looks like I was worried for nothing.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:What are you talking about...?
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:It's not even a problem now, because you— +You aren't the real Model L either, which is why you sensed the abnormality in me so quickly.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Enough nonsense! Who ARE you?!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:No need to worry, I'll tell you everything.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK's Dummy</Speaker>||:Let me introduce myself. +What would be the easiest way for you to understand this? Oh yes, you can consider me KSVK's Dummy.
()<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:...!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK's Dummy</Speaker>||:Judging by that look on your face, I'm guessing you don't believe that a Dummy could have a will of its own. +But there are exceptions to everything... If the mainframe lost consciousness, wouldn't a backup Dummy become the mainframe?
CETME556(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Model L struggles to lift herself up and slowly gets to her feet.
CETME556(0)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker>||:Impossible... I've never heard of a program like that before.
CETME556(0);KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK's Dummy</Speaker>||:Oh, don't be so silly. That's just a guess on my part. +As for why I would make such a guess? +Naturally, it's because my main body has lost consciousness.

KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK's Dummy</Speaker>||:Nothing comes to mind? Then let me tell you the truth.

CETME556(0);KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK's Dummy</Speaker>||:In human terms, they would lack a soul, I think? After all, a Dummies' purpose is to carry out orders. +Which means, you're nothing more than a Dummy yourself. +But I'm not the same. I'm the Chosen One, the child of destiny.

CETME556(2)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker><Position>0,115</Position>||:Commander, what's my next mission?

CETME556(2)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker><Position>0,115</Position>;MG3(4)||:Speaking of which , did anything special happen on your end?

CETME556(2)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker><Position>0,115</Position>||<黑屏2>:... +I see, a lot happened to you too. +And thanks to you, the Commander's safe.

CETME556(2)<Position>0,115</Position>;MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Hehe...you're finally laughing. +That's the real you.
CETME556(2)<Speaker>Model L</Speaker><Position>0,115</Position>;MG3(4)||:Hm? ...What do you mean by that?
CETME556(2)<Position>0,115</Position>;MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:I mean, you shouldn't keep pushing yourself. You're ready to keel over any minute, right? +Our work for the day is over. Let's go back.
