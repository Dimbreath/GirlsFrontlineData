()||<BIN>79</BIN>:I encounter Zas M21 to see she is engaged in a lively discussion with a guest.+Seeing me wave to her, she excuses herself with an apologetic look before walking over to me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hi, having a nice chat?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Mhm, it's rare to meet a human with such similar tastes.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I see. Speaking of which, that's a nice outfit you're wearing today.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Thank you. I'll look you up for a chat the next time I'm free.+Though, I want to say, there seems to be a problem with this place.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Huh, what problem?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I noticed that there are other Griffin T-Dolls present here.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hm? And what's wrong with that?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:What's wrong? Commander...+Those dolls are NOT FROM OUR TEAM.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Oh? Is that so...? Haha...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Commander?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Uhh, those Dolls are extra security staff...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Really?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:With the jewel being so big, it'd be safer to have more people watch over it...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:...That'll do, Commander.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(Whew...did I pass?)
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:So in short, there's no need to worry.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Er, ah, I'm going to interpret that as you're not going to waste time on unnecessary details and instead will focus all of your attention on the mission...+Is that correct?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Exactly. Commander, your deductive skills have progressed by leaps and bounds.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Th-Thank you...+In any case, do your best for the mission. I'll leave this place to you.

ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Heh, do you regret staying by yourself?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I don't understand what you mean.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Really now...+Although, I just realized that you haven't been going all-out until just now.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:That's because I've been thinking.+Thinking. Do you understand, DSR?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Hm?

DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:My dear, spacing out during a battle is very rude.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...DSR, are you really a phantom thief?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:What else would I be? I still need to link up with EVO 3 and make off with the jewel♪
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:This makes no sense at all. You're a Griffin Doll.+The Commander ordered us to guard the jewel. Why would you all come to steal it?

ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...I find it hard to understand the reasoning behind that book's existence.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Kakakakaka.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:...Hold it. What kind of strange sound is that?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Don't you know?+T91 taught me this special villain laugh. That's how its written in the manga books she borrows.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;DSR50(4)||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:What kind of lame joke is this?+...Hey!

ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Yes, and they're fine now.+The only thing they mentioned is that they couldn't remember what happened.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:(Quietly) That's good...+Though, there is one thing, Commander.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:What is it, do you have more to report?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:All of this makes no sense.+The only thing that can explain this lack of logic...+...Is that the jewel was deliberately stolen, and the so-called "404 Phantom Thieves Brigade" doesn't actually exist.+And...you knew all about this, didn't you?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏><Night>:(Cough cough!)
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:You're acting quite suspiciously, Commander.

ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:...And the fact that Grizzly and EVO 3 passed out really did make me worry for a while.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Don't worry, they weren't hurt too bad. They're in no worse condition than coming back from a logistics mission.+However, I didn't expect you to be so concerned about the other Dolls, Zas.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:...What nonsense are you talking about, Commander?+If my teammates ended up dying then my experiences gained from working with them would become a waste.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Don't keep overthinking things.+You need to share your concerns with them from time to time.
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Is that so? Dolls don't need to be concerned with feelings like concern or disgust.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:So this is how you feel?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Everyone's just like a can of food to me. There's no difference whether you go to a different base, join a different echelon, or get to know different teammates.+In essence, it's just like going to a new city and buying a can of food from a convenience store. All you need is to taste a few mouthfuls and you can throw it away. It's pretty much the same wherever you go.+Besides...you're the ones who decide what we do and see.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Zas...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Sorry, I've pried too deeply into this.+Perhaps...I shouldn't have known about the truth behind the operation.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:No, no, I'm the one who should be apologizing...+I should have been more...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Sorry, the apology just now was just a formality.+But isn't it nice that humans at least have the luxury of remorse?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Are you...unhappy, Zas?+Is there something I should do...
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:No, I just want to forget some things.+Forget all about those deductions and the things I shouldn't have been thinking about.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Th-Then, what do you want to do?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:What do you think, oh wise Commander?+Don't you think I need something to divert my attention?
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Zas M21 shows off her fingers.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:What? No!
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:This is the latest brand of nail polish.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>4</黑屏1><Night>:I look at Zas M21's nonchalant smile with an ache in my heart.

指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>4</黑屏2><Night><Night>:I-I don't know how to pick those things!
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:(Laughs) If you think there's something I need to know, I can find out at any time.
ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Alright...+So...I'll go pick some out with you on a weekend?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>4</黑屏1><Night>:I look forward to that.

指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><Night>:By the way, which ones are you thinking of getting?
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>9</BIN>:It's very simple. I want all of them.
