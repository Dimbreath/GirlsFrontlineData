MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:What? For real? This isn't a scam, is it? +Is the source credible?
MDR(0)<Speaker>Private Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's true, Kalina told me herself.</color>
()||:Tap tap tap tap.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:But I heard the previous organizer had no plans for a Halloween party this year? Even the one at the café...
MDR(0)<Speaker>Private Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Springfield has no intention of organizing it, which is why I'm thinking about doing it myself.</color>
MDR(0)<Speaker>Private Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm recruiting some like-minded Dolls so that we can put our heads together.</color>
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Heh...
()||:Tap tap tap tap.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What exactly do you have in mind?
MDR(0)<Speaker>Private Message</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Nothing specific yet, but I'll try my best to avoid causing mayhem like they did last year.</color>
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...In that case, I have just the idea. Wanna hear me out?
()||:Tap tap tap tap...
()||:MDR rapidly types in her reply. Just before she hits the "send" button, she licks her lips deviously.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hehehehe... FIRE.
()||:MDR grins as she turns off her phone. She buries her face in the pillow and kicks her legs in excitement.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hohoho, I can't wait for Halloween.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:...A few days later, in a warehouse at the Griffin base.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:The fearsome hemorrhagic fever spreads throughout the nation within a very short time... +To protect himself from this horrific plague, the king builds a massive wall and shuts the city gate. +The king, his friends, and his family take refuge in the depths of the fortress, but they can still hear the cries over the walls... +...And so they start trading stories – just like what we're doing now. That way, they can forget about the pleas for help coming from outside.
()||:Pairs of wide eyes are all focused on the story teller. +MDR pauses dramatically as she basks in the attention.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:...W-What happens then?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:Don't give her what she wants, S.A.T.8. MDR is waiting for us to react.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter what kind of ghost story it is. If ghosts or monsters appear, just fight them off.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:The people in the castle don their masks and throw parties night after night. They take turns telling stories – funny ones, scary ones, astounding ones... +However, one night, when a story teller stands up after the end of the previous story, everyone can tell that something is amiss. +This person is draped in white cloth from head to toe. Among the lavishly dressed aristocrats, he sticks out like a rotten corpse wrapped in old bandages.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:He looks exactly like...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:AAAAAAHHHH! Like that, behind you!!
()||:MDR points toward S.A.T.8, behind whom a hovering white phantom appears out of thin air.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker><Shake>||:ACK!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:This must be a trick... Watch me!
()||:S.A.T.8 jumps in fright, but Bren nonchalantly leans over and grabs the phantom. She takes hold of its fabric and flips it over.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:The king orders the others to capture this stranger who managed to slip into their sanctuary, but when the cloth wrappings are removed, nothing remains except for a pungent waft of crimson fog. +Soon, the people in the castle collapse one after the other, blood trickling out from every orifice of their faces...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Yes, it is Death! Death is upon us! Nobody shall be spared! Hahaha!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:MDR finally gives into her urge to laugh as she guffaws at Bren for triggering the trap. She laughs so hard she blows out several candles.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:...I don't find this funny at all.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:True, if we were humans instead of Dolls, we'd all have contracted the Red Death and died, thanks to you. +But I really have you to thank for – for being such a cooperative audience and lending so much to the overall immersion.
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Humph, whatever you say.
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I see... So you used a drone and a dye pack? That is an ingenious way of creating that immersive effect.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Sheesh! It's taboo to expose a magician's tricks! Even if you have it figured out, you shouldn't have ruined it so quickly! +More importantly, what do you think, S.A.T.8? I put a lot of effort into preparing for this, I'd love to hear some feedback from the organizer!
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Hold on, I-I'm still calibrating... My neural cloud is a little... +It...it's Bren's turn next, isn't it? Please get ready...
()||:Looking incredibly pale, S.A.T.8 gasps for air as she stares frightfully at the "phantom" fabric covered in red powder lying on the floor.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hehehe...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Just seeing the cute and cheerful S.A.T.8 looking so freaked out makes this a big success.)</color>
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Not to mention that the whole thing was recorded by the drone. With a little editing, I can upload it onto Grifchan.)</color>
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(I doubt boring old Bren will have any fun story to tell. Then I should make use of the time to process the recording and make a new post on Grifchan...)</color>
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:MDR, I know exactly what you're planning. +You'd better not upload anything that happened today onto Grifchan!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Aw, c'mon! You were so funny, S.A.T.8! +Trust me, it would become the hottest thread of the day!
BrenMK(2)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:I suggest you don't do this. +If the Commander finds out about this, you probably won't have the chance to spam the forum for the rest of the week.
SAT8(4)<Speaker>S.A.T.8</Speaker>||:Th-that's right! +Besides, we'd make trouble for Miss Kalina, who arranged this secret venue for us!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Tsk, but it's such a shame not being able to share this on Grifchan... +I've prepared so long for this day.
()||:MDR snaps her phone shut.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Humph...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Fine, it won't be a live stream, but the drone will still record everything for me.)</color>
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(As for that bossy Commander...I already have a similarly equipped phantom trap drone waiting in ambush just outside the Commander's bedroom.)</color>
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(The Commander will spring the Red Death ghost trap just by opening the door, then I'll get the complete footage of the Commander's stupid face! Muahaha, Happy Halloween!)</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><黑屏1>:But a flash of dazzling light overwhelms MDR's vision all of a sudden. She only recovers from the shock after a few seconds.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Huh? What was that? Has a fuse tripped? Or has the light tube blown?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...Hmm? Where is everybody?
()||:The little cubicle filled with Dolls dressed for Halloween trading ghost stories just a minute ago is now completely empty save for herself...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:What's going on? Did everyone just decide to stand me up all of a sudden? Is this some kind of new flash mob practical joke? +Hold on... Let me think this through... +Hmm? Wait a minute, I'm a freaking idiot. The drone has been recording everything! Summon the witness!
()||:MDR smacks herself on the forehead as she figures out the simplest way to learn about the truth. +The video playback from the drone shows something that manages to leave even the seasoned netizen gaping in disbelief.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Replay at 1/8 speed. +Replay at 1/16 speed. +Replay frame by frame!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:This looks like...some sort of flickering? +You guys... What's with this drop in frame rate? Huhhhh? Gone?!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...? What the hell? How's that possible? Everyone vanished into thin air just like that?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Is this some kind of time-traveling story? Then why am I not a part of it? Don't tell me it's because my case of 8th-Grade Syndrome isn't serious enough?!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Okay, this is unbelievable, but I should base my theory on facts...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:But if I ask about this on Grifchan...people will probably think I'm trolling.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Oh well, just thinking about stupid stuff isn't gonna solve anything. I should head to the command center first.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:At least I'll be able to monitor the power and systems of the base from there. If they really got sucked into the electric cables, I might be able to find a way to get them back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the Griffin command center.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Phew, nobody here... +That's good, I don't have to waste my breath trying to explain this to the Commander. +Hold on, if I end up getting sucked in like the rest of them, won't it be game over?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Oh, right! I can start a live stream! If I get sucked in in the middle of that, someone is bound to notice.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In that case... "Halloween Special! Live at the scene of the mysterious Griffin Doll disappearances!" Thread opened! +Now as everyone in the audience can see, the brave and resourceful yours truly has made it to the command center, ready to re-establish contact with my lost friends. +Huh? Come again? MDR has no friends, so this must be some kind of RP inside my head? +Damn, I didn't ask for this kind of roasting. When this is all over, I'm gonna find you and tear you to pieces!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:After turning on the main power, the lights on the walls and the control panels all come to life.
()||:MDR plugs her phone into the computer mainframe and starts searching for the missing Dolls' signals within the storage drives of the base.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Electronic Warfare Simulation Training Room...not that. +Underground Arcade...not that either.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Main Server Room...activated ten minutes ago? +Bingo!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Identify signal... Oh, it's TAC-50! +Hey, do you hear me~?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Is that...MDR?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I got a reply! Can't believe this is working! Maybe I'm actually a genius!
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:Where are you? Are you also trapped?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;TAC50(2)<通讯框>||:Nope, I'm completely free and well. +I think everyone, except for me, got transported to cyberspace where you get to be heroines. Honestly, I'm jealous. +As for how even your bodies were gone – that's totally a supernatural phenomenon.
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:What? You've got to be kidding me! Hurry up and put us back!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;TAC50(2)<通讯框>||:...What if I say no?

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;TAC50(2)<通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Humph, to tell you the truth, this has been my plan all along – sending people that rub me the wrong way to a different world... +If the plot develops this way, what do you think? Is it frightening?
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...You jerk! People could actually be in danger!
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:This is no time to fool around! What's wrong with you?!
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;TAC50(2)<通讯框>||:Hey, it's Halloween – Trick or Treat. +As the only one spared by this..."displacement", I gotta keep a cool head, you know. Or would you rather I start whining and screeching like you?
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:Well...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;TAC50(2)<通讯框>||:Just calm down and stay where you are. We'll keep in touch. +I need to locate the others' signals first.
MDR(2);TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:Alright, you're the only one who can sort this out... Please find the others.
()||:...Beep.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Great, there's a good chance the rest of them are safe as well. +So long as they're still within the computer system, even just as data fragments, I can probably still integrate them with their neural cloud backup copies and re-install them into new bodies...
()||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏>:Suddenly, the light tubes above her head flicker twice.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><Night>:Then with a snap, everything goes dark.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:No way, another tripped fuse?! This is bad, is their data stored on the hard disk or the cache? +If the power doesn't come back soon, there's gonna be big trouble... Backup power supply... Where's the backup...? +Guys on Grifchan! People watching the stream, a little help?! Can't you at least give me a hint about where the backup power supply is? It's a matter of life and death here!
()<Speaker>Comment Section</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>There's a switch under the left drawer of the desk.</color>
()||:Following the instruction given by her follower in the comments, MDR soon finds the switch and flicks it.
()||<震屏>:The moment she flicks the switch, she feels a heavy impact on the back of her head, then she crashes nose-first right onto the cold, hard floor.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Ugh. Ow, that hurt... What was that, some kind of prank...? +Is...is the power back...? Why is the command center still so dark?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As MDR lifts her head, she sees something utterly beyond her imagination... +In front of her stands a cloaked pumpkin monster wielding a rifle with a bayonet. It does not look friendly.
FAMAS(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Shake>||:Eeeeeeep!!! +S-s-s-s-stay away! Back off! I said, back off!
FAMAS(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
()||:MDR ducks underneath the desk shakily, but the pumpkin monster bends down and peers at the cowering MDR.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Shake>||:Uh...um...I-I'm a carnivore, 100%! +I-I haven't killed a single pumpkin ever since I came out of the factory...I think...
MDR(2);FAMAS(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is that you, MDR?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker><Shake>;FAMAS(2)||:Y-y-you're mistaken! I don't know you, and you don't know me.

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Huh...? +...Is that really you, Fr FAMAS?
()||:MDR crawls out from under the desk and studies Fr FAMAS from head to toe several times.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:...You've always dressed like a rebel, but I totally didn't expect you to go so hardcore for Halloween.
MDR(2);FAMAS(2)<Speaker>Fr FAMAS</Speaker>||:I don't know when...I think I've been wearing this ever since I came back from cyberspace.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||:...Cyberspace? Hmm, hold on, even you got sucked in? +Were you at the ghost story party as well? +Wait a minute... +Don't tell me...

TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Can you hear me, MDR?! We all made it back safely! +Hmm? Where's MDR?? Has she left?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Huh? Hold on...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:Whatever, at least everyone is fine. +Right then, let's all go and get our neural cloud checked.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:W-wait! TAC-50? TAC-50! Fr FAMAS and I are still in here, help!

MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:How...
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:Let's just get out of here.

TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:...If the plot develops this way, what do you think? Is it frightening?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What?
TAC50(2)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Actually, we did some investigation after we got back to the real world and realized that even you were trapped in cyberspace. +Fr FAMAS is there just to fetch you. It's our way of showing a little gratitude since you inadvertently helped us by giving us an opening to leave. +It's Halloween – Trick or Treat.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:... +Tsk... +So, Fr FAMAS... You've known about this all along?
MDR(2);FAMAS(2)<Speaker>Fr FAMAS</Speaker>||:S-sorry...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||:Then why are you wearing something so scary?!
MDR(2);FAMAS(2)<Speaker>Fr FAMAS</Speaker>||:I just wanted to try being a different me...
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||:What even...? What happened to you in cyberspace?
MDR(2);FAMAS(2)<Speaker>Fr FAMAS</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter. Now, should we get out of here?
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||:Sigh~ Fine, though it's missing some sense of closure calling it just like that.
MDR(2)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>;FAMAS(2)||:Still, this "Halloween Special! Live at the scene of the mysterious Griffin Doll disappearances!" has been a great success.
