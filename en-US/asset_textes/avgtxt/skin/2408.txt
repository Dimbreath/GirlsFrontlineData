SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:The seaside...the seaside... We're finally at the seaside...
()||<BIN>162</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:On the beach, SPAS-12 hums an off-key tune of her own invention as she fiddles with her shield... +...Or at least, what had once been a shield.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er, SP... I mean, Sabrina...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:What is it, Commander?
()||:SPAS-12 is already in her swimsuit and she's looking intently at me, eager to enjoy the beach...with that former shield in hand?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that...your riot shield?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Oh, this? It was a training tool I used once. Ah, that brings back memories...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And so you brought it today for...surfing?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker><Shake>||:Surfing!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you can surf? That would need excellent balance and control.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:What's with that look of yours? I've practiced this countless times in the VR simulator!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you've never done it for real, huh... +Also, who put that stuff in the simulator?! +And back to my point, is it really okay to go surfing on this riot shield?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hehe, I specially modified it into a surfboard for this beach operation! How is it, pretty neat, huh?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It looks cool. I didn't think you knew how to modify these things.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:(Shakes head) Hehe, there's a lot of things you can only enjoy if you do them with your own hands, Commander! +Also, I'm capable of a lot more than this. Looks like you haven't been paying enough attention to me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry about that. I'll do better in the future.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:In the future?! You'd best start paying attention to me now! +Commander, please carefully observe my wave-riding skills.
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:SPAS-12 dumps the modified surfboard onto the beach with a dull thunk.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:By the time I come back to the beach, you'll be begging me to teach you how to surf!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, hurry up and go while the beach isn't crowded yet, Sabrina.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, well, at least you remembered my name.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SPAS-12 clutches her surfboard to herself, then hops and skips and runs to the water's edge. +Come to think of it, she's been asking me to call her Sabrina all this time, and I don't remember when exactly I started humoring her. +Was it to make her seem more human? Or was there a special meaning to that name...? +Still, today isn't a day for thinking about such things. Today ought to be spent on relaxing, so I shouldn't let any accidents interrupt us—
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good day, Griffin T-Doll.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2>:Huh? You're... +...Who are you?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I am a T-Doll, just like you.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hmm... I could tell.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:My, you're more wary than I expected. I was simply curious...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:That's just a surfboard. There's nothing special about it.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You noticed the direction of my gaze?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Who exactly are you, anyway?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Don't worry, I'm a friend. Your Commander will vouch for that. Oh yes, do you like beach volleyball?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hah?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:We're planning to organize a beach volleyball match. Would you like to join us?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:A volleyball match? What's that?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's a game where people volley the ball back and forth. The winner gets a prize.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Sorry, but I'm not interested in prizes. Now, I intend to have fun here for a while, so if there's nothing else...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ah, but if we win, we'll be taking the prize from you. Do you know what it is?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:W-what is it...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hehe, I haven't decided yet.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<Shake>:Eh?! But how can you make that decision by yourself?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Your Commander agreed to it.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:The Commander... Why?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Aw, it's just a game anyway. If you don't want to play, I can always ask your other friends.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<Shake>:I'm in!
()||:SPAS-12 raises a hand up high.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I don't know what this volleying ball stuff is about, but I won't lose to you!
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:That T-Doll with the closed eyes was peering at my surfboard the whole time... +Does she know what it is? Is she going to name that as the stakes? Why did the Commander agree to this...? +No matter what, she's being too curious. I won't lose to that squinty-eye, whoever she is!
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏><BIN>162</BIN><震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Bang!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:AN-94 scores! +My... Does that mean we win again?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If...if this keeps up, it won't end well... +The two of them only LOOK like they're playing around — they're actually dead serious!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm up next. +And my opponent will be...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Me. I'm the last one.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ah... Miss SPAS-12, hmm? I've been looking forward to this.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Did SPAS-12 run into Task Force DEFY before this? The look in her eyes is a little different from the usual. +She looks pretty serious, you don't see that often. Don't tell me—
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 scores.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:B-but why?!
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:SPAS-12, when this sort of thing happens, the point goes to the opposition.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:R-really?
()||:SPAS-12 looks back to me, but all I can do is smile sadly and shrug. +As I thought... However motivated SPAS-12 is, she's going to lose out if she doesn't know the rules well enough. +Even so—
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SPAS-12 scores.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh my...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Humph! I already know what to do!
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:SPAS-12...is surprisingly strong. +Ah, no, it's not that surprising. +Now that I think about it, she really is suited for simple, rough physical labor. +It's not like she's stupid, but rather...
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 scores.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Dammit...
()||:SPAS-12...doesn't really want to give things too much thought. +She has a different approach to many things compared to most other T-Dolls.
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
()||:What does she care about? +A name? A surfboard? Or a match? +She's always smiling, but the truth is...I don't really understand her...
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SPAS-12 scores.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You seem quite serious. That's somewhat different from my initial impression of you.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:(Pants) And how much...do you know about me?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You like eating.
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 scores.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You're worried about your weight.
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:AK-12 scores.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So, am I right about those?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Haha... Well, you're not wrong...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What are you laughing about?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Well...
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏>:...Bang!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:SPAS-12 scores.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:...I'm glad that you know only so much about me.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What else should I know, then?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:What you should know is...I've already got this game figured out.
()||:Though it's the final set, SPAS-12 looks surprisingly relaxed.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:..Oh?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:All you need...is brute force!
()||<闪屏><duration>15</duration></闪屏><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BANG!
()||:...
AN94()<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Er...
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh dear... +What should we do? I didn't expect this at all...
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Frankly speaking, it's not like I didn't see this coming...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN>:Commander... +Who gets the point if you burst the ball?
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:My neural cloud doesn't have anything about such a rule, but in theory... Where did it fall, anyway?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:But, but! If the ball hadn't burst, it would have fallen on your side, going by its path! +That was my super move, you'd never have been able to stop it!
()||:Why are you talking about super moves after just one game?!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:S-say, the ball isn't entirely on our side, is it? +See? It's more like it's fallen in the middle!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But...it already touched the net...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:That doesn't prove anything, the ball's corpse fell straight down!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Great work, Sabrina!)
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:In that case, we ought to see how much of the ball's carcass is on each side.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Very good, that's the outcome we want!)
()||:I catch SPAS-12's eye and tap my foot. She immediately gets the message.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah...Then why don't we take a break first before we calculate the area on both sides? +Oh, P38, you came too?
()||:SPAS-12 surreptitiously sidles over. All she needs to do is stick out her foot to nudge the corpse of the ball to the other side. +Our plan will soon grant us victory...
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hey, what's everyone arguing over? Let me be the judge!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why did you come back?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I thought...it would probably be more fun to come back and help you guys out...
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What do you think, Miss Witch?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hehe, it's obvious enough! +You see that ball?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Huh?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There's more of it on our side, so doesn't that make us the winners?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:... +In the end, we were a moment too slow, and thus we failed. +I guess karma just wouldn't let us cheat. I glance at SPAS-12 and she sticks her tongue out at me...in a way that only I can see.
()||<BIN>163</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:At dusk, we sit on the beach for some rest before the bonfire is ready...  +I see SPAS-12 discussing something with AK-12, and then she comes running back with her surfboard in hand.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:What did you talk to AK-12 about?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:She was interested in my surfboard, so I let her check it out.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You really gave it to her?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:It couldn't be helped... We did lose, after all, and I saw no reason to refuse either...
()||:SPAS-12 puts her surfboard aside and sits next to me.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Besides, she just took a look at it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That really was a quick look.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hmm... It looks like she didn't find anything special, so she returned it to me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That surfboard...or rather, that shield... Is it very important to you?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Sort of. It's just that it's been with me for a long time, but it won't be of much use in the future so I thought I'd modify it and bring it along on this trip.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Can you call that...thriftiness? What a surprise.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Not really... I just don't like throwing old things away. +If only my things...could stay with me forever...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So that you can step on them and grind their faces into the seawater?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Meh, its better than taking bullets, right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Indeed. No one can even tell it's a riot shield, right?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:No one except that AK-12. She stared at it for a long time the first time she saw it, but when I finally let her study it, she just looked for a few seconds before giving it back. +Is it because I didn't modify it well enough? It felt like she was looking down on me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, no, she's curious about everything. It's just that her curiosity only lasts a few seconds.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So you do know them.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I met them once during a previous operation. Whether that counts as knowing them... Well, I'm not too sure myself.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Then don't just let them talk you into doing stuff that we're not good at.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You girls ought to encounter new things from time to time. It helps you to learn. Why, didn't you enjoy it?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Alright, it was pretty fun... It was a proper workout...
()||:Plop. +SPAS-12 leans back and sprawls on the sand.
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Although...it would've been better if we'd won...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you still bothered by the outcome of the match? I mean, you did very well for your first time.
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hmm... Still, if I'd tried even harder, then maybe...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sabrina... +Do you want to get serious?
SPAS()<Speaker>SPAS</Speaker>||:I don't know. I'm always lazy, and I'm happy with how things are now...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, I don't have an opinion about it either way, and work-wise...
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Although, Commander...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmm?
SPAS12()<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Do you really like how I am now?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||<黑屏1>:I look down at SPAS-12, her expression completely obscured by the dark.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>163</BIN>:Can you be any different?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Maybe I can... I don't know... +Will you...need me to change in the future?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, if this is your top form, then there's no need to change, is there?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:That's true... +My... How did the conversation end up like this?
()||:SPAS-12 laughs, but it sounds hollow. Perhaps it's from her neural cloud, or her heart, or...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I know! It must be because I'm hungry!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That takes you a whole process of deduction to figure out...?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:That's because my heart's more sensitive than my tummy! Take me to a burger place now, Commander! There must be one nearby!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Maybe not today, the reviews for that burger place are horrible. Besides, you ought to eat something healthy from time to time.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:How bad can a burger get! Besides, T-Dolls don't get blocked arteries from eating junk food, so it doesn't matter if I eat a little more!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You won't eat anything else?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hehe, my policy is to never eat food I don't like!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Goodness, what a fussy eater you are...
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hehe, what's wrong with a T-Doll who's satisfied with junk food?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What about roast meat, then?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Roast...meat?!
()||<震屏>:SPAS-12 bounces up with a sproing!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Once we get the bonfire going, we can start roasting it.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Ehhh?! You never said anything about that!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's because I didn't know if you liked it. I guess I should take you to the burger place after all.
()||:...Just kidding. How could I not know?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||<Shake>:Then you obviously have much to learn about me! +So that burger place has bad ratings, huh? Well, I've got more faith in your roasting skills, Commander! Hurry, hurry, let's get the fire started!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We'll begin once Ameli and P38 come back! +Hey, stop shaking me, Sabrinaaaaa~!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:As SPAS-12 shakes me, I see Ameli and P38 coming back with their hands full of firewood. It seems that our conversation is about to come to an end... After all, SPAS-12 probably won't talk too much once we start roasting the meat. +In the end, I didn't manage to ask about the name "Sabrina"... +Still, it's not too bad. I've learned enough for today. +Besides, this is good too. No matter what implications the past or future hold for her, the present SPAS-12 is the girl before my eyes... +And I hope the present will last a long, long time...
