()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:At the expo venue. +JS9 and T91 are going through a list of tasks to be completed.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:In that case... I'll take care of organizing everyone. +That means I'll have to trouble you with the logistics side.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Mm, don't worry, I'll make sure we get all the support we need. +My job is to make sure everyone is fed and supplied.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Uh, that's not what I meant. +I'm not worried about that part at all; after all, you're very trustworthy, T91. +What worries me is...can you keep PA-15 under control?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I see... I'll do my best.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Oho? What are you talking about? +What does she need to do her best in?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Nothing whatsoever. +How come you make no noise when you walk, PA-15?
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Ehhh...? But I just walked up normally to you. +Or are you troubled by a guilty conscience, hm?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:A guilty conscience? +It's not like I've done you wrong or anything, don't be ridiculous.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Let's leave the chatter aside for now. +You came just in time, PA-15. +T91 will manage the logistics resources with you. +Move our supplies to the temporary warehouse, then distribute our rations.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Mm, got it.+Work hard, PA-15. +Do it for the Commander's sake.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:When you put it that way, I don't really have a choice, do I? +So all I need to do is mind our stores, right? Sounds really simple and boring.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:You won't know if it's simple or not until you try your hand at it. +I'll be heading off first; I still have a lot of things to do all over the place. +I trust this work should be well within your capabilities. +Do your best.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:I have the feeling she doesn't quite trust us. +Could it be me? Does she not trust me?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Alright, we should be going too, PA-15. +We've got lots to do as well.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ooooh, playing deaf now, aren't we? +Alright, I understand. In any case, I just need to do the job, right?
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2>:We've sure done a lot. +So, can I go now?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:...We haven't even started yet, have we? +Your motivation vanished way too fast. +That's why we don't trust you.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Aw, don't be so mad. I totally understand. +I was just wondering.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:...Look, I know you don't like this sort of work and find it boring. +But work is work. Your personal preference is irrelevant. +So please be responsible, alright?
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:I know, I know. +If I wasn't planning to do a good job, I'd have slipped away to have some fun already.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:You're too restless, PA-15.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:That's why I'm saying there must be something wrong with the person who gave us our assignments, right? +Having me do this despite knowing how I am... +I mean, ration resupply, fireworks... Anyone could do this. Why does it have to be me?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:That's because we're critically short-handed and have no choice. +Now quit complaining, I'm going to distribute our rations. +Be good and keep an eye on this place.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Yes, yes. +Alright, I got it. +(Sighs)
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I'm not going to go soft on you just because you're deliberately sighing so loudly.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:You really are an annoying little devil, aren't you, T91?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I never imagined the day would come when YOU would say that. +I'm off, keep an eye on the place!
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am— In any case, I just need to make sure this stuff doesn't get stolen, right?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well, you're not wrong. +In any case, don't let anything happen to it.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2>:PA-15 should be fine, right...? I'm worried about her. +It's odd though... When you think about it, PA-15 always completes her missions flawlessly whenever she's deployed. +She hardly ever shirks her work either. +But I just can't bring myself to trust her. I wonder why...
()||:Though she feels a little uneasy, T91 doesn't have the time to worry about others right now. +She feels the weight of the big and small bags hanging off her hands, as well as the responsibility placed on her.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Forget it, there's no point overthinking this. +Since I've entrusted the matter to her, it's too late for me to worry about what's going to happen on her end. +Rather, I should put my trust in her and just do my own job.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Let's see, my first stop is...
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Just a little more over here... Alright, go ahead, HAL 9002. +It might be hard to believe, but I must tell you the truth... +I am your father.
()<Speaker>HAL 9002?</Speaker>||:?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Still doesn't have enough impact? +Alright then, let me think about it again... +Okay, one more time!
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Gr MG36 looks like she's in a good mood. But what's with that hamster? +She looks like she's playing, but she's probably pretty busy, so I guess I shouldn't disturb her.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>89</BIN>:I don't think the packaging team have started yet...huh? +SPP-1 and PKP are already here? They sure are early... +I didn't think the two of them would be so motivated.
PKP(0)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:...
SPP1(4)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:...
PKP(0)<Speaker>PKP</Speaker>||:You're early, SPP-1.
SPP1(4)<Speaker>SPP-1</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点1>:For some reason, the mood in the air seems a little strange. Am I imagining things? +They look like they're making preparations, so I probably shouldn't disturb them either. +Hopefully they'll notice I've put their stuff over here...
()||<黑点2><BIN>84</BIN>:A bubble tea store suddenly comes within T91's line of sight. +It seems to glow in her eyes, and the fragrance of the different flavors of bubble tea wafts out of the front door. +As a connoisseur of bubble tea, T91 knows it's of superior quality.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Milk Tea Store</Speaker>||:...
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:No... I can't, I'm still working.
()||:A delicious smell comes from the bubble tea store.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:... +Maybe just a little... That should be okay, right? +Really just a little bit...and it's not alcoholic anyway... +It...it won't interfere with my work!
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Ahhh— That is fantastic! +The tea itself is really tasty, and even the pearls have just the right consistency. +Looks like I found a pretty good place, I guess I'll try the other flavors next time I come here...
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:...Erk. Oh no, how long have I been gone? +Ah, this is bad! I need to hurry up and head back!
()||:T91 rushes back to the furniture expo and heads to the temporary warehouse.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Come to think of it, I've left PA-15 alone for a long time. I feel bad for her. +Maybe I'll give her some of my bubble tea... No, I'll take her to the store with me next time.
()||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2>:Feeling a slightly bit guilty, T91 walks up to the temporary warehouse and pushes the door open.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(2)||:PA-15, I'm back—+—What the hell are you doing?!
T91(2);pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Oh, you're back, T91.+What am I doing...? Isn't it obvious?+I'm entertaining myself.
()||:PA-15 is still sitting on her chair. +What's different now is that... +For some reason, PA-15 has tied a huge bundle of fireworks and firecrackers to the chair and she has the fuse in one hand... +And an open flame in the other. It looks like she's going to ignite the fuse.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(2)||:Alright, I get it. +You can have all the bubble tea, please just calm down.
T91(2);pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Why are you being so polite to me all of a sudden? +Is what I'm doing really dangerous or something?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(2)||:...OF COURSE it is! Please, stop, I'm begging you! +I only stepped out for a bit, how did things escalate so quickly?!
()||:Granted, it wasn't just for a little while... +But when she thinks that all this might have happened because she wasted all that time at a bubble tea store, T91's head begins to ache.
T91(2);pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:I see, so it IS pretty dangerous.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Forget it, the important thing is that you understand.
()||<BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM>:Still with a pensive look on her face, PA-15 lights the fuse without any hesitation..
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:NO! +Why are you doing this?!
T91(2);pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Well, isn't it natural to want to do something when other people tell you it's dangerous?
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(2)||:How is that natural...ah.
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Oh dear.
()||:... +The burning fuse vanishes into the body of the fireworks. There is a moment of silence.+Then...
()||:Snap! Crackle! Pop!
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker><Shake>||:Uwaaaahhhhh!
pa15(2)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Oho... This is a little...ahaha.+Not just a little, it's SUPER exciting!
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Quit laughing! If you pile this many fireworks and light them all at once, they're going to explode—
()||:As soon as she realizes that, T91's outstanding reflexes immediately spring into action.+She reaches behind herself and closes the door to the provisional warehouse.+Then...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏3><黑屏1>:—Boom!
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...A scene of utter devastation.
pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||<BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM>:Ow ow ow... Hm, that WAS pretty dangerous after all.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:If...
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Ah?
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||<震屏3>:If you knew that, then you shouldn't have done it!
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Aw... Alright, I shouldn't have done that, don't be mad.+You've got such a pretty face, it's already enough of a shame that it's all coated in soot and dust.+Let's not make it worse by scrunching it up with that frown.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:And whose fault is it that my face is covered in soot?!+Honestly... I'm so mad I don't even know what I should say.+...Oh.
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:...Hm?
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:...Doesn't this debris look a little familiar?
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:That's my chair, right?
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:You mean they USED TO BE your chair! +Ah... This is terrible...
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Relax, relax...
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:Why are YOU comforting me instead...?!+You should be the one panicking now.
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:That's why I'm sucking up to you.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:I just...+I just don't know what to do with you...
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:That bang just now was pretty loud. If we draw the other Dolls over, it'll only add to everyone's workload.+Even if I say I want to take responsibility for it myself, they'll definitely try to pitch in.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:... +...I'll help you divert their attention. +During that time, make sure you clean everything up! +Also! Make sure you piece that chair back together!
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:For real? What a taskmaster.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>;pa15(3)||:No ifs or buts!
T91(3);pa15(3)<Speaker>PA-15</Speaker>||:Fine, then I'll leave the other matter to you. +Miss Accomplice.
T91(3)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Shut up! +If you say one more word, you can take care of everything by yourself!
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2>:T91 leaves the warehouse in a huff. +...When she thinks about how she's partially responsible for this as well, she just can't stand back and pretend to be an innocent bystander.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I need to find a way to buy time... +It would be one thing if the Dolls on the other teams found out, but if the Commander saw that mess...
()||:A chill runs down T91's spine.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Business is bad to begin with, but if word of this got out... +The Commander would probably faint on the spot...
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:In any case, let's try to turn the furniture expo around! +Once things get busy, nobody will notice what's going on in the warehouse!
()||:With that thought in mind, she spurs herself into motion and strides rapidly over to the main door. +T91 slowly approaches the exhibition hall's entrance, then takes a deep breath to perk herself up.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:I can't just give up like this. +If I surrender now, the Commander will truly be disappointed in me. +Griffin's motto is "Never surrender!" +At most...I'll just join the reception team and help them out! +That's right, that's what I'll do!
()||:A commotion can be heard from beyond the main entrance.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Hm? +What's happening...? Are people making a fuss?
()||:Amidst the clamor, more and more people are congregated just outside the expo venue, waiting to go in.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:Things got so lively all of a sudden... +Looks like the reception team has succeeded in their task...
()||:...
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:...In that case, the problem's been solved, hasn't it?
()||:T91 breathes a sigh of relief.
T91(2)<Speaker>T91</Speaker>||:That should do. +With this many visitors, not just the reception team, but everyone else is going to be busy. +I hope PA-15 can tidy things up during this time...
()||<黑屏1>:As she watches the two Dolls throw themselves into their work, T91's anxiety gradually subsides, and she even finds herself humming a tune. +Now that she thinks about it... Why was she even so worried in the first place? She's not alone, after all. +All she has to do is give everyone a bubble tea.
