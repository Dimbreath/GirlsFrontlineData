Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Huuuuh??
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Um, Grizzly...I'm terribly sorry...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm very disappointed, Commander.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I know...so like I was saying, I didn't want this to happen either...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, I've already finished making the dress that I'll be wearing for the event.+(Mutters) And I spent a whole week on it too!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Why have you Dolls begun to mutter so loudly recently...)
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...I heard that, Commander.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah...speaking of which, that dress will still be useful for this mission.
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Still useful how...?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Listen, Grizzly...+Although our mission is to protect the jewel, we can't just stand around in full combat gear. +This is a birthday party after all, and if you're wearing a dress, you can better blend into the crowd...+Because...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Because?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Our opposition this time...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Opposition?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:(Loudly) Is a band of phantom thieves!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...+(What should I do, is Grizzly not the sort of Doll to be interested in phantom thieves? Should I change my approach...?)
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:Ah! I got it, Commander!+Phantom thieves! You mean like those villains that wear capes and fly around in the air while cackling out loud, right?
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Well, probably not all of that...
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I guess it can't be helped if it's to deal with phantom thieves.+I'll do my best to complete the mission!
Grizzly(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah, in that case, good...+I'll leave it to you, then.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>:I let out a sigh of relief as I watch Grizzly leave in excitement.+I did not expect the whole "phantom thief" premise to be so attractive to the Dolls.+I really am regretful that everyone would not be able to relax and celebrate the anniversary together...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2><黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:Still, this mission ought to bring them a different kind of enjoyment. +I'm already looking forward to everyone's mission reports.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>:On the day of the anniversary. +At the cocktail party.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:I see Grizzly dressed in a splendid dress, standing in the far corner of the venue hall. She is watching the men and women with an excited look on her face.+At the same time, she is still in her usual alert stance from training. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this sight, and I quickly make my way over to her.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hi, Grizzly.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Grizzly nods at me.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hello, Commander. Everything's normal so far!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:...I say, Grizzly, aren't you being a little too tense?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I'm staying alert, Commander.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Uhm, about that...+You don't need to be so nervous.+Just keep an eye out for the phantom thieves, that's all.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:But Commander! They're phantom thieves!+How should I put this...they feel kind of cool, don't they?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(So she was actually admiring them when she said they're "villains that wear capes and fly around in the air while cackling out loud"?)
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I mean, doesn't it mean that my friends and I are the protectors of the jewel?+As a friend of justice, I shall lay down the law on those phantom thieves!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:...Did being teamed up with Welrod infect you with something weird?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Huh? Like what? You know, it's more like we just get along really well.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Forget it. In any case, you're being too obvious by standing here.+If there was a phantom thief around, they'd immediately pick you out as one of the security staff, right?+Also, it's important to enjoy the adventure.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Mm...+You're right, Commander.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:It looks like you ended up looking forward to this mission after our chat that day, didn't you, Grizzly?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yes, this operation appeals to me very much.+I see...I was looking forward to it so much that I ended up getting a little nervous.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:That's alright, just put on a good performance.+I'll leave the security work to you.+I'll be heading next door to look around.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点1>:Yes, Commander.+I'll take good care of the jewel!

Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:Whew...I escaped...+I really have to hand it to them. They managed to separate me, Welrod, and ZAS...

DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:...My, do you have so much free time to be exchanging sweet nothings?
()||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Gd DSR-50 blocks Zas and Grizzly's path, and her tremendous firepower forces the two of them to focus on dodging.+ZAS shields Grizzly with her body and shoves the jewel into Grizzly's hands.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:H-Hey!+Why are you doing the same thing as Welrod...
Grizzly(2);ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:It's not the same.+As far as the goal is concerned, Welrod's there to tie off loose ends.+After all, assassination and the like is child's play for her.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:...
Grizzly(2);ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:On the other hand, we need to escape pursuit, protect the jewel, and deliver it intact to our client.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;ZastavaM21(4)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:Then why are you...!
ZastavaM21(4)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:You're kind of a bonehead, aren't you? +This is the most sensible plan! I'll delay her so you can escape with the jewel!
DSR50(4)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框>:Hello, anyone there?+Why are you two chattering among yourselves while ignoring me?
DSR50(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><边框>2</边框><SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Gd DSR-50 fires at Grizzly.

()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2><黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:Grizzly rushes into the smoke under the roar of the explosion. She escapes down the corridor as ZAS lays down covering fire, then she finds the door to a storeroom and ducks inside.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2>:Ah, my dress ripped... DSR's bullets must have grazed it earlier...+That's just going too far... I hardly ever get the chance to wear a dress so I spent ages working on it...+Tch...I didn't expect the battle with the phantom thieves to be so intense...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Just then, Grizzly's communicator begins to flash.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:Huh, an internal call?+It should be a Griffin signal...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2>:The call connects.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(Ahem)...Hello? Can you hear me?
灰熊()<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(Huh? There's no image?)
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:This is Griffin HQ. Are you Grizzly from the jewel protection squad?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Yes, this is Grizzly.+Our squad was attacked by phantom thieves, please send reinforcements!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Understood. What's your current position?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I'm in the third storeroom along the corridor to the north of the event hall.+Zas is currently engaging DSR in the corridor and she should be able to hold out for a while. I haven't spotted any enemies on my end, and I'm safe for the time being.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Understood.+A Doll with a scar running down her right eye will be there in ten minutes. That's UMP9. Hand the jewel over to her to complete your mission.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Roger.+...Uh, hang on?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Wh-What is it?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:This conflicts with our squad's original mission. Please re-confirm.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:No, there's no conflict (static) mission is to hand the jewel to UMP9.+(Static)
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(Huh? What was that just now?)+Please re-confirm! This jewel is very important!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(Static)+...Yes, that's correct, it's a direct order from the Commander. (Static)
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:(It sounds like some sort of abnormal interference...)
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Grizzly? Hello, are you still there?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Ah, yes.+I understand the operational directive. I'll wait to make the transfer in the storeroom.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:OK.
()||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2>:The call ends.
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:Grizzly gingerly walks over to the door of the storeroom and carefully listens to the sounds from outside.+Apart from the sporadic noises of shooting and explosions, Grizzly strains and manages to hear something she wants to but also doesn't want to hear.
()||<BIN>88</BIN><SE2>RunStep</SE2>:The sound of footsteps.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><SE2>RunStep</SE2>:(Just as I thought...)
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:The footsteps stop outside the door. Grizzly holds her breath and tightly grips her gun with both hands.+One second passes, then two, then three.+The door opens with UMP9 standing there. Grizzly raises her gun and presses it against UMP9's temple.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Phew...calm down, Grizzly...I'm UMP9.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:...
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:I'm here to collect the jewel~+But you already knew that.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:Got it.+UMP9, huh...you must be one of the phantom thieves, aren't you?
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:A member of the phantom thieves, huh...am I or am I not, I wonder?
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)||:
()||<SE2>Reload</SE2>:Grizzly disengages her pistol's safety.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Okay, okay, I'm not a phantom thief, I'm just here to retrieve the jewel!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:I don't believe you.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:...Hey, now you're just being unreasonable.+I say I'm a phantom thief and you want to shoot me. I say I'm not and you don't believe me.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:(Glares) ...
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:I'm one of the good guys. I'm not with DSR and the others.+Just trust me, it won't do you any harm.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:You wouldn't have faked a Griffin signal in the call if you were on my side.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Well, uh...+You can't really call it faking a signal because I definitely count as a Griffin T-Doll too~
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:Hah. Things are getting more and more interesting.+What is this, some kind of riddle game? I really wish Welrod were here right now.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Come on, is it really a good idea to treat a colleague who came all the way through hostile fire to meet you as some kind of criminal?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:I never did that, don't talk nonsense. And besides, I haven't confirmed whether if you're a real colleague or not yet.+I'm going to tie you up here before returning the jewel. +Then I'll fetch my teammates to help solve this mystery and report on this mission to the Commander. That's all.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Oi oi, what do you mean by solving this mystery? Don't you think that's just a li~ttle out of the scope of your mission?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>;UMP9(5)||<BIN>88</BIN>:(Glares) ...
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Alright, alright, in order to prove I'm a good guy, here.
Grizzly(2);UMP9(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>:UMP9 suddenly holds her hands out to Grizzly, who is so startled that she nearly pulls the trigger.+UMP9 smiles to Grizzly, and motions for her hands to be tied up.+Grizzly holds onto her gun with one hand and extends her other hand to UMP9.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>5</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Everything fades away the moment Grizzly's hand comes into contact with UMP9 - the sounds of shooting and explosions, the scenery around them, and even UMP9 standing before her.+UMP9 lays the unconscious Grizzly neatly on the ground before rifling through her dress for the jewel and pocketing it.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点1>:That's the end of this adventure game for now.+You really are scary, Miss Grizzly. If I hadn't prepared "this thing" beforehand, you might have actually caught me. -- Yours sincerely, Miss Phantom Thief.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:Nighttime, Griffin base.+Dormitory.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:(Knock knock)
()||<BIN>82</BIN>:I knock on the door of Grizzly's dorm, and shortly after, the door opens.+Grizzly still has her dress on with a doubtful look on her face, as if she had spent the whole night doing complicated math questions.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hey, Grizzly, how was your night?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Commander...+I don't get it at all!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Huh? What's the matter?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I clearly had the jewel secured and I was going to hand it over to the client...+But then something happened, and the jewel disappeared...+Ahhh, for the life of me I can't remember what happened.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Well, about that...+There's no need for you to worry.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Commander?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:You've already completed your mission.+I heard people talking about how reliable you were on the battlefield! And your teamwork was excellent as well.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Does this really count as...completing my mission?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Yes it does. Trust me.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Glares) ...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Ah...how am I going to explain this to her...)
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I understand, Commander.+Since you've already said as much, I won't remain hung up on this any longer.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm surprised to hear Grizzly say that, but I'm also happy that she would trust me to this extent.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Pats Grizzly's shoulder) Good.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Although there's way too much that I can't figure out, tonight's events felt just like an adventure story...+In any case, I thought it was really cool.+But—
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Nervous) B-But?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Commander, I hardly ever get to wear a dress, and mine got torn during a fight...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:So if I get the dress fixed, I'll be able to wear it the next time I go out for a ride with you.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:...You're going to ride while wearing something like that?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Don't underestimate my skills!+Commander, since it's the anniversary, can I request that my mission payment take the form of a dress repair...?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hah, you're not very good at acting cute, Grizzly.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Oogh...I'm not trying to act cute! It's a reasonable request!
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Is this really all you want after going through all that?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I can't think of anything else, and I'm not sure whether it actually happened or not...+The only thing I can be sure of is the damage my dress took...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Unfortunately, there's no such option on the payment request form.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Really...
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:But I'll make a special request just for you. Don't worry about it.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Huh?
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Well, if we're wrapping things up, we might as go for the perfect ending, right?+After all, simply fixing a pretty dress like this won't be enough.
Grizzly(2)<Speaker>Grizzly</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><震屏><黑屏1>:Really, Commander? Thank you so much!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:In this instance, I see a flash of light in Grizzly's starry eyes.+It would seem there is a perfect ending to this mission after all...+...Both for her, and for me.
