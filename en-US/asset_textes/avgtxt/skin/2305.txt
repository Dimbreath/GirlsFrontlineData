指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Two weeks... +While Dolls probably learn at a different pace than human beings...+Isn't two weeks for maid training a little rushed?
()||:It has already been several days since everyone had began practicing in the cafe, and I came down to the cafe as usual to check on everyone's progress.+While there were some accidents here and there, we still have quite a bit of time for training, so everything should be alright...right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(It's just that...)
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:The documents labelled "IDW" go here... +And then the ones labelled "G1" go here...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Why is Gepard still sorting out forms, even in a maid cafe?)
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:If need be, take the documents out and place them on the tray...+And then carefully bring them over...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(The guests are going to see a maid open the lid on a serving tray and see a whole stack of documents there instead of a dish...)+(No, I think Gr G28 said M1 is practicing this, but...why?)
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Er, maybe I should just hand them over directly...+...+Why are you hiding by the wall and spying on me, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Because...I'm curious. +I was thinking that you'd be practicing something related to serving guests since you're wearing a maid outfit in a cafe, right?
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Well, I AM practicing how to serve guests...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:By... sorting out documents?
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:We might be maids, but we will be working at an international conference center. +The humans attending the meeting will definitely ask for the retrieval of documents...at least, that's what Miss Gr G28 said.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That certainly makes sense. I have to hand it to Gr G28 for thinking of that.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:So I borrowed some old documents from Miss Kalina to simulate what might happen. +Besides, I'm sure that on the day of, there'll be so many documents that I won't be able to sort them all out...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That said, you've still got too many! +Did you bring all these documents over?
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Work is always full of surprises. +I'll be glad if I can finish this job without making any mistakes, even if I have to sacrifice my vacation to prepare for it... +Uuu...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(...The atmosphere feels sullen all of a sudden...) +Er...did you encounter any other difficulties these past few days, besides the documents?
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:... +Not really, just the usual, simple stuff you run into at work...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that so... +Your daily performance is very good, Gepard, and you're also very diligent. I'm sure you'll be able to handle the job.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:I thought it's because I'm easy to bully, which is why I fit the image of a maid...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uhm, of course not!+(Although, that part of her personality was also a reason why she got the job.)
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:But the image I had in mind of this job is really different from the reality of it... +It never occurred to me that I might end up as a maid someday, so there's a lot of things which I don't know how to do...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's also a reason why we're giving everyone time to get used to the mission environment. +After all, few people on the base have as much experience in this field as Gr G36.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:But it's impossible to prepare for something we've never experienced before. For all I know, the overtime I'm doing right now might be a total waste... +At first I thought that everyone else was better than me and so I wanted to see how they did, but...
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The others, huh... +Well, everyone's starting out fresh and slowly feeling their way around, so it's perfectly normal for there to be some mistakes.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:But if even they are so lost...then what about me? +I haven't messed up so far...but I'm sure it's because my mistakes haven't been noticed yet...
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're overthinking this, Gepard. You're every bit as capable as the others. +I know I told everyone about the importance of this bodyguard job, but I hope you won't stress yourself too much.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:I honestly don't believe I'll make the grade for this training...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Or perhaps you haven't made any mistakes because you've been very diligent throughout the entire process. +Speaking of which, could you let me see the results of your training?
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ah...yes... +All the documents from here to there have already been sorted out.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I flip through the documents before me and find them to be very organized for searching and referencing. +I'm pretty sure the attendees would have no problem making use of them on the day of the event.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Commander...wh-why aren't you saying anything? +You must have found a lot of places where I messed up, right?
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:No, in fact, it's the opposite. +Given the way these documents have been sorted, I'm sure that they will definitely be very helpful to the proceedings on the day of the event.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Sigh...you don't need to comfort me like that...
(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm a commander, so I won't lie just to comfort others. I would definitely tell you if I find any problems. +It looks like your practice for the past few days has been very fruitful.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:I-Is that so... +...I did spend a lot of time on it...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While I can't make up for the vacation time you've already used up... +Considering this is such an important job, it would make perfect sense to give extra vacation time to the people who've contributed to it.
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Extra vacation...! +Then...can I combine the extra vacation time with my existing vacation days?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Erk...how many vacation days does she have saved up...) +While the rules allow for it, please don't take too many days off. +The base won't feel right if you'll be gone for a month...
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:When you put it that way...doesn't that mean you won't give out that much vacation time... +But I feel a little more at ease now, so long as you don't deny us our vacation times afterwards...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I would never do that! +Everyone who should be on vacation should take it! Don't bury yourself in work all day!
GepardM1(2)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:Alright...I understand. +It's a deal, then. I was actually relieved to hear you say that you were happy with the way the documents were arranged... +... + (Quietly) Since there's extra vacation time in store, I'll continue practicing over the weekend.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hey! I just finished saying that!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:That Gepard...she's a lot more thoughtful than she looks... +If she could apply it all to her work, she'd be able to do a better job, right? +Still, it doesn't matter what motives she has as long as she completes her tasks with diligence. +Instead, I'm kind of curious about how she'll use her vacation time now.
