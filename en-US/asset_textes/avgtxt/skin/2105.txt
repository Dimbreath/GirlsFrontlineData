()||<BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:At the rendezvous point before the start of the mission.
()||:I look around but I do not see the person who should be meeting me here.+Isn't SAA here yet? It's already this late...+Just as that thought ran through my mind, I hear her voice.
M1873()<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Commander, Commander, over here~
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I turn to look at the source of the voice, and I am startled by her outfit.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...SAA?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! Don't I look good today?
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA nimbly pirouettes before me.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You look very good.+But what's with this...costume?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Since I'm playing a phantom thief, I ought to look the part, right~? +Besides, a phantom thief always make her entrance in a showy outfit!+What do you think? What do you think? Doesn't it suit the role?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, it does... But remember, we're not just playing around. You need to be careful and fastidious while carrying out your mission.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Roger, Commander. I won't disgrace my mission! Otherwise I wouldn't be able to face you!
()||<黑点1>:SAA nods earnestly and performs a courtly bow before leaving.+...I hope she's taking my words seriously.
()||<黑点2><BIN>79</BIN>:More and more people begin to gather around the jewel display area as the party goes on.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:That sure is a big jewel... Though, this may probably be the last time it will ever appear before the eyes of the world.+It looks very pretty indeed, but cola is much more important to me!+Let's finish this mission quickly so I can drink cola to my heart's content after I get back!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SAA begins the operation as planned.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Mhm~ Let me see...where's the fire alarm...
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:Aha, there is it!+Let's just see how sensitive it is... Uwah, it's loud!
参观的路人()<Speaker>Party Guest</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:The fire alarm? Is there a fire? Run! It's a fire!
工作人员()<Speaker>Venue Staff</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Everyone, please don't panic. Follow our directions to evacuate through the exit!
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>139</BIN>:Seems like most people have left the building. Guess it's about time to show my stuff and make it rain cola!
工作人员()<Speaker>Venue Staff</Speaker>||:Please don't linger in the hall, miss...+Huh? She was here just now... Was I seeing things?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Now!
()||:SAA reveals herself from the shadows and knocks out the venue staff with a tranquilizer round.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:That should do it...+Wait, it looks like there's someone else here to stop me.
()||:SAA draws her gun and points it at the only other person still standing in the hall.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Wait, IDW!?+...+Hm...so that's why things were going so well.+In any case, I'm a phantom thief now!
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA pulls her trigger.
IDW(2)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:You...you're...
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Whew, you have frightening combat reflexes.+Unfortunately, your ability to multitask is nowhere as good as everyone else.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM><Night>:After the mission, I see SAA at a nearby meeting point.+Leaning against a wall, SAA is spaced out with a can of cola in her hand.+She seems a little tired, but is still in good spirits.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Commander! Over here!
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA waves to me as she notices my approach.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thanks for your hard work, SAA.+I know you're taking a rest...but I need to ask you about the whereabouts of the jewel.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander...but I don't have it.+It seems that the agents of justice took it while I was dueling IDW.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see, then I'll go ask the others later.+It seems things got kind of rough between you and IDW. Are you alright?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I'm fine.+Although I wasn't able to snatch the jewel, I still won my duel with IDW! And I got some cola out of it!+Want a can, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, but I'll save the cola for when I get back to base.+SAA, you look a little out of it... Are you really alright?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I'm fine! I just moved around a lot today, and I did quite a bit of calculations too.+I'll be back to normal after this can of cola~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And by "quite a bit of calculations", you mean...?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Well...I was thinking, my mission should have been over by the time IDW showed up, right?+So I shouldn't really mind that the jewel was snatched away either...+Would you say that's correct, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh? Why would you think that?
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA's eyes slightly waver, but quickly settles.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Why indeed... Yes! It must be thanks to the guidance of cola!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:It really was because of cola's guidance! Without cola, I wouldn't have been inspired like this~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Then we'll leave it at the guidance of cola.+It's getting pretty late. Why don't you head back soon?
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Sure thing~ I just finished my can of cola anyway!+I might still make it for the party back at base if I return now~
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry for making you all miss out on the company's anniversary celebration because of this mission.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:It's fine, Commander! Someone has to do it, right?+And besides...I had a lot of fun tonight. I should be thanking you for letting me take part!
M1873(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SAA winks at me and removes her hat before taking a bow.
M1873(4)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I'll be going now, Commander!+Let's share a victory cola later~
()||:I watch SAA's back fade into the end of the street.+She has always been cheerful and lively, but the look on her face this time was not one that I have seen often.+She probably sensed that something was off, but she chose to hide her doubts.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So it was all due to the guidance of cola, huh...
()||<黑屏1>:If cola could show me a path where everyone could relate to each other sincerely and without hesitation...+Then I would chug it all down like SAA.
