()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Let me think...
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Shirt, cloak, sash, belt... +Right! Everything's there! +Then I should get changed...nein, I should leave it for later...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:AUG, do you think I should get changed now? +I know it isn't time yet, but if anything happens...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:... +Personally, I think you should go to bed immediately.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:That's out of the question! Everyone is taking this so seriously out there! +But if I change into my outfit so early...and get it dirty, that'd be terrible... +Or...should I ask for a third opinion?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:SSG and G17 are both asleep. If it's something so important, you should decide on your own.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:But I'm worried that some unexpected accident will happen... +If...you were me, would you get changed now?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:... +Snowy vestments are bound to be sullied. It is an eventuality that has no direct correlation to the passage of time.
IWS2000(0)<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Okay! Then I'm getting changed right now!
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:(Mutters) Which is why I hate white clothes.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Phew, all set! +Hmm...AUG, do you think I'll look better in a black cloak instead?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:But the others will also be in formal dress... Maybe I should put on more...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Say, AUG, should I prepare some gifts? +Showing up empty-handed seems pretty impolite, don't you think...?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:You've spent so much time on dressing up nicely, but why is Gepard M1's face printed on the lantern?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:Uh, no reason. You're reading too much into it...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:That's what every cheating husband says as he starts placating his wife.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:I didn't even say anything! Let me explain! +I honestly just think the way she completes every mission so diligently is very commendable! +And what the hell is this whole cheating husband business?!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Just a purely coincidental association in terms of semantics. Don't read too much into it.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:You started it! +Sheesh, it's finally the annual "New Year's Eve" that Big Sis 81 talked about... Just cut me some slack...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:So we have invented a new festival to celebrate the fact that our planet has completed another orbit around the sun. Is it worth all that effort?
()<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||:(Mumbles blearily) I think so...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Aha! See, AUG? Even SSG thinks it is! +Besides, WE didn't invent this festival. Humans have been celebrating it since a long, long time ago! +I've got to be impeccably dressed today; there's just no cutting corners!
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:There is no correlation between T-Dolls and a festival celebrated by humans. +Or are you so eager to be out in the gust on a cold winter night?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:The cold isn't the key here! +Everyone is always holed up at home in winter. Now we finally have a reason to visit each other and bolster our friendship - isn't that great? +Life has to be lived ceremoniously.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I don't understand your neural cloud's penchant for imitating humans.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:That's fine, you'll understand when you take part! +Make more conversation with everyone. Who knows, it may even change someone's gloomy image.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Vector has already provided a counter example, so my suggestion for myself is to turn in immediately.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Then...should I take SSG and G17 with me?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A muffled voice comes from under the duvet next to them, but the words are unintelligible.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:SSG agreed with you that this festival is well worth the effort. This shows how enthusiastic she is about it. You must absolutely bring her along, dear leader.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||:Argh, nein!! +I'd be happy to come any other time...but it's just too cold out there tonight! Let me say in the dorm!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Are you sure you don't want to come...? +AUG, it's not every day that—
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I really appreciate your earnest invitation, but staying indoors holds a lot more appeal to us than this "New Year's Eve". +You really should set off soon. Any further delay would cause trouble for others.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Ugh... +Then I'll...be right back once I finish making my New Year visits.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Have a safe trip. +Also, you forgot your lantern.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>161</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Hmm...? +...Huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...IWS finds herself all alone in the middle of the road.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Why is nobody here...? +Didn't they say they're all ready...? +I guess...I'll just wait a little longer...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +...IWS is still alone in the middle of the road.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Or have they already gone...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:...At Type 56-1's dorm. +She knocks.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:No answer.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:...Nobody here either? +Where...is everybody...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:...IWS stands by the door entirely alone. The sound of firecrackers and fireworks comes from a distance.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Why...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>161</BIN><Night>:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Ugh...it's so cold... +Who...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Hey—!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<震屏>:...Oh! Someone's over there! +<size=55>Fräulein 56-1! Guys! I'm here—</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...IWS peers into the distance excitedly, but the area is completely deserted.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:... +Was that...just the wind...? +Did I mishear it...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Did I...get something wrong...? +I thought we all agreed to visit each other...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Rustle.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Should I keep looking...? +...Maybe I should just go back...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Rustle.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Nein! Pull yourself together, IWS! +If I go back just like that, AUG will laugh her butt off! I can't just return without doing anything!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Ha! I knew it was just the wind. I was right! +Fräulein 56-1 wouldn't be so quiet— Uh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...IWS notices a pair of golden eyes staring at her in the gloom.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:You are correct, dear leader. Type 56-1 and her friends do tend to make a lot of noise.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Didn't you say you were going to turn in? Why are you here...? +Wait, you heard everything I just s...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I don't remember any of it. +But I wasn't the one who promised to return soon. G17 is worried about you.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:...I didn't realize I've been waiting out here for so long.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Really? +So what are your thoughts on the human tradition for celebrating New Year? +You must have received a lot of feedback regarding your elaborate preparations.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:... +Nein, not at all... +I...couldn't find the participants of the New Year visits... +I tried looking for CZ75, but I didn't run into anybody even after I came back...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I was just asking out of interest. +Before hearing your squawk, I just brushed shoulders with Type 56-1 as I walked past her.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:You ran into them?!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:And a certain T-Doll who is still working overtime. +If you missed them all, then you must've managed to steer clear of everyone along the way. Truly an exceptional feat.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:What?! +How could...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I thought you were in search for some hustle and bustle. Who knew you'd rather celebrate New Year by enjoying the wind in solitude.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:But then again, it is none of my business. Tschüss .
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AUG turns around to leave.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:W-wait! +Where are you going, AUG?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Back to the dorm. +Now that I've confirmed you're in reasonably good shape, I can make myself scarce.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:... +Then I... +I'm coming back with you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AUG raises an eyebrow.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Didn't you just say you couldn't just go back? +You didn't want AUG to—
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||<震屏>:Argh! So you DID hear everything! +I said that because...I just couldn't accept the fact that...I didn't run into anyone...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:But you're all satisfied now that you've run into me? +If you have just a little more persistence, you could very well come across more Dolls wandering about. +Don't you want to show your lantern to the person whose face is printed on it?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:I do want to...but I don't even know where to go... +56-1 and the others have probably wrapped up their visits by now... In that case, it doesn't even matter where I go...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...It was rare to see you preparing for something that isn't a mission with so much enthusiasm. +If you don't mind letting all your effort go to waste, I have no problem with that either.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:It's not a problem of wasted effort... +Whether it's this New Year activity or the preparations I've made...none of it matters now. +Other than coming to terms with what happened, there's nothing else I can do... Perhaps I should've learned this lesson ages ago.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...The hazy candlelight from the lantern illuminates the path back to their dorm. Not another soul is in sight along the way.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:... +...AUG?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I don't know.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:Let me finish, dammit! +What did you mean...when you said you'd confirmed that I was "in reasonably good shape"?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:G17 speculated that you would exhaust your battery due to over-excitement and collapse in the snow, unnoticed.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:As if I would neglect such basic maintenance on myself! +... +Did G17 actually think that would happen?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I was lying. She's fast asleep.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:Phew...that's good to hear... +Sigh...I didn't expect things would turn out this way when I set off.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:What DID you expect?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:I don't know either... +"New Year's Eve"... Big Sis 56-1 and the others all wanted me to take part in the activity... +I thought I could've at least done something for them...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Working blindly only to earn other's recognition. This outcome is hardly surprising.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:I wasn't working blindly! +At least this time...the outcome didn't mean that much to me! I am NOT dejected over the fact that I didn't run into anybody...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:You've devoted so much time and effort to putting together your new outfit. Are you not eager to receive compliments? +That has to be why you'd make that kind of face just before you left.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:What do you mean "that kind of face"?! +You say that as if you've been peeking at me all the time!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I hardly have to peek. I honestly pray that I don't have to see a certain Doll being all bubbly the moment I open my eyes.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:... +Is that so...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Both today and last Halloween... +Your reward wasn't commensurate to your efforts. You know that better than anyone else.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:...Perhaps. +All I can do...is to take this lesson to heart.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Then I'll leave it to you to adjust your mentality.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Sigh... +... +...Hmm?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:AUG?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I don't know.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:AUG, are we...walking back to our dorm?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Is that something worth questioning?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:It's pretty dark so I can't see very clearly... +But we aren't walking in the right direction, are we?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:That's because it isn't easy to plan a route back home from your previous location. We have no choice but to take a detour. +If you don't trust me, feel free to find your own way back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...IWS comes to a halt.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:We're at the archive, AUG.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Are we? +The lights are off in the building though. What a shame.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:...You said someone was working over time. Where is she working overtime?
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I forgot. +I'm sure that hardly matters—
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:You only say "I forgot" when you're lying.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Then please substitute what I just said with "I don't know".
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Just admit it! +...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:There you go again... Why must you always...!
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Why?! +Things don't have to be so complicated!
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:There's someone I know. She has very high expectations on everything, but in truth, she often ends up biting off more than she can chew. +Whenever things take an unexpected turn, she copes with her situation in a really silly manner. It's exhausting to watch.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:...Humph. +If it's so exhausting, you can very well just let her be...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I'd want to. +But it's pretty easy to make this a meaningful night.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:You insisted that we were heading back to the dorm...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Technically, we are. We've merely taken a convenient detour. +The footprints on the snow are still fresh. Gepard M1 is on her way to the dorm. +According to the schedule, 56-1's group should be in the building directly ahead of us. If you're lucky, you can still meet up with them and make it in time to pay Groza a visit.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.6</CGDelay>:Well? Still haven't decided which direction to go?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Let's go back, AUG. It's getting late.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:... +I hope... +I hope this is a carefully calculated decision, not an impulsive whim.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:It is. It's enough.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:The choice you just made is precisely what makes you so aggravating. +Compared to watching you be a goody-two-shoes then regretting it, I'd rather you stick to being a fool.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Really? +But I know what you're actually thinking. This doesn't happen very often.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...You're assuming I was telling the truth.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:I mean it... It's enough. +Say, AUG, you...
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I don't know.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Just let me finish, okay? +All this time, I've been working very hard because I care a lot about what others think of me...but I am trying to change. +I'm...not as weak as you think, at least not anymore.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I vaguely recall a girl standing all alone in the snow with a lantern, looking really despondent.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:I admit I still feel disappointed when I'm not rewarded for my efforts... +But to me...the outcome is no longer everything.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:An IWS who no longer values the outcome or others' recognition. +What does she want from life then?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:Nothing, really. +It's not like...I have to be seen making an effort. +Looking at it that way, I have no reason to be sad even if nobody sees the work I put in. Simple!
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:That sounds like something SSG would say, not you.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:It wouldn't be strange for me to say that! +Rather than having the whole world know how hard I've worked, it's more important for someone I care about to see the fruits of my labor. +That's why I'm not bothered by what happened tonight.
AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:The Commander isn't here though. +Congratulations. All your hard work in the last two days has not paid off.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:The Commander isn't here, but you are. +Haven't you been with me the whole night?
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:You have such unreasonably low standards for yourself. Your roommate can't actually help the fact that she saw everything you did tonight, even though she had no desire to.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:But to me, all my hard work HAS paid off as long as you saw it. +I...can live with that.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:But it's someone else's face on your lantern.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:Why do you care so much about whose face is on the lantern?!
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:I repeat - you have unreasonably low standards for yourself.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:Neither of us are how you think we are. +You have too little confidence in yourself and in me.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:That's because compared to "me", "everyone" is more important to you.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:That's how I used to be, and it caused me great pain. +I also...ended up leaving a very bad impression on you all.
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)||:I used to believe that I must make myself twice as useful. I thought that was the only way for Tactical Doll IWS 2000 to prove her worth... +...until I met the Commander...and you, AUG—
IWS2000(4)<Position>0,150</Position>;AUG(0)<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Can you stop? I don't really want to listen to your cheesy confession.

()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:Why don't you just leave me and keep walking?
()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||:How could I do that? What if I walk too far ahead...and don't see you there when I look back?
()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||:...Is something wrong with your neural cloud?
