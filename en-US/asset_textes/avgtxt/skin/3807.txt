64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:And then, the Commander went to rescue M1919. +The part where the hero rescues the damsel in distress always sounds good in any story, don't you think?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(0)||:But then...the test of courage from back then didn't work out, did it?
97typeS(0);64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Yup. But at least I had fun.
97typeS(0);64type(0)||:
()||:Type 64 excitedly tells Type 97S about Halloween from two years ago, but Type 97S rests her chin on her hand and looks a little vexed.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(0)||:According to what you said, some people were still scared.
97typeS(0);64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:True, it was set in a haunted house, after all.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(0)||:What a shame. If not for those incidents, you could have had an interesting test of courage.
97typeS(0);64type(0)||:
()||:Type 64 thinks for a bit.
97typeS(0);64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:While I think that the aged facilities in the base are going to cause some problem one way or another when the time comes... +It'll be time for the Hungry Ghost Festival in a few days, but I haven't heard Miss Springfield mention any events happening this year.
97typeS(0);64type(0)||:
()||:Type97S suddenly smacks her shield.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(0)||:Aha! I'll organize a test of courage this year, then! That'll solve the problem, right?
97typeS(0);64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Why do we have to play games like these for the Hungry Ghost Festival? We ought to stay in our rooms and not venture out at night, and definitely not look back when we hear people calling our names...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(0)||:It's not the Hungry Ghost Festival, it's Halloween! +I'll go discuss it with the Commander! Want to help me out, 64?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll pass, Hawk. I'd rather watch videos of the whole thing, so make sure you record it all for me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:...On Halloween. +Inside the Doll dorms.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 64 frowns as she stares at the display monitor in front of her.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:That Hawk... I told her I wanted to watch a video of the whole thing, but she didn't have to include this too, did she?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:The shaking video image shows the Commander's somewhat startled expression.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2><回忆>:...Several days before Halloween. +Inside the Command Center.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Um...ah...Hawk, your outfit is quite...interesting...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I know, right! That's what the tailors at the clothing department said too. Good thing I went to all that trouble to find the reference material. +NZ even wanted to help me design it, but thank goodness I managed to stop her. +Hehe, after I got my new clothes, I wanted to let you see them first.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah...um...not bad, not bad... +Oh yes, so what's this about?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Right, onto the main subject. +Commander, can you let me handle this year's Halloween event? I want to host a test of courage!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A test of courage, hm... Now that you mention it, the event we had last time degenerated into utter chaos. +Alright then, I'll leave it to you. Let Kalina know exactly what you need.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! +Also, you HAVE to come for it! I'll send you a copy of the event itinerary!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? I'll be taking part too?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Of course! And...I have something very important to tell you, Commander!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Um...huh? Something important? +For some reason, I have a very bad feeling about this...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><关闭蒙版><Night>:...Back to the present.+Inside the Doll dorms.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I managed to borrow a miniature camera from someone! I'll mount it on my hat so you won't miss anything!
97typeS(2);64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:That said, I think the camera's going to shake hard enough to show NZ as Miss Spitfire, given the way you'll be running around during the event...+Also, what do you mean by "something very important"? Are you going to confess to the Commander? On the Hungry Ghost Festival?!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(2)||:It's not the Hungry Ghost Festival, it's Halloween! +And how could this be a confession?!
97typeS(2);64type(2)||:
()||:Type 97S looks up at the nearby wall clock.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(2)||:Oh look, it's about time to begin. +That's enough resting for now; I'm heading back to the venue to take a look!
64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, alright, do your best. I'll just laze around in my room and wait for your video.

97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Listen up, everyone! +For this event, we'll be divided into the monsters and the victims! If the monsters manage to scare more victims than not, it's a win for them; otherwise it's the victims that win! +I'll be keeping a close eye on your performance! Now then, let the game begin!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With her hand on the microphone, Type 97S loudly explains this year's Halloween activity and signals its beginning.+She looks to the left, then to the right, while the camera on her hat quietly starts filming.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Hehe, once we get into the spirit of things, I'll arrest the Commander, then I'll—

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Type 97S hurriedly accepts Type 56-1's request before she can finish, and rushes over after verifying Type 56-1‘s position.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑点2><Night>:...Half an hour later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S rushes back to the test of courage and runs through the activity area where both groups are taking part in the event.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Security... No, Model L, I was gone for a while. Did anything happen?

97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:...Both!

97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:It's been a while since the event began. I wonder if the Commander's here yet. +I'll just go take a walk around and see if I can capture anything fun... Who knows, I might run into the Commander too—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Once again, the sound of the comms interrupts Type 97S's monologue.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Type 97S hangs up and races off toward Type 80 and Type 03's position with the speed of a wildfire.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I can't let the Commander end up with that 03! Otherwise the Commander won't be able to leave all night!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑点2><Night>:...An hour later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S returns to the test of courage, looking very exhausted.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Seriously, why are Dolls even taking notes by hand in this day and age? Good thing 03 found it in the end... +And there's all kinds of problems on this end too... +(Sighs) Where's the Commander? Why hasn't anybody seen the Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Somewhat dispirited, Type 97S shakes her head, but just as she's about to begin recording the Dolls involved in the test of courage—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Her comms ring again, and now Type 97S' neural cloud is start to ache.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<震屏>:What is it now? Who lost what this time?! Or did something get stuck in a machine again?! +Don't bother me anymore! I don't care if it's salty lapcheungs, I'll just eat them—!

MG3(4)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Huh, your Halloween outfit is pretty special, M870.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<黑屏1>:So you were screaming because it was so round that you couldn't stand up?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...After the test of courage. +At the Doll dorms.
64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...So in the end you just went and shot it?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 64 has a helpless yet amused look on her face as she watches the footage that Type 97S is playing.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Yeah, that was the simplest solution, right?
97typeS(2);64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Hm...for some reason, it feels like M870's going to be traumatized because of this. +Like, she's going to stay far away from pumpkins during the Hungry Ghost Festival or something...
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(2)||:I told you, it's Halloween, not the Hungry Ghost Festival! +Still...
97typeS(2);64type(2)||:

97typeS(2);64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:What's the matter, Hawk?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(2)||:I couldn't find the Commander in the end... +I think I caught a glimpse of the Commander a few times, but I couldn't rush over to check because of things like this.
97typeS(2);64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Yeah, you sure worked hard so you wouldn't have to eat the waxed sausages I made.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>;64type(2)||:That's the one thing I won't compromise on!
64type(2)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||:Forget it, I'm not going to argue with you over this. Someday, you'll come to love them too... +It's time to eat, right? Then there's no point moping here. Head over to the café, I'll be there once I change my outfit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Type 97S nods and bids Type 64 farewell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>87</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Late on Halloween night. +In the Griffin Café.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Type 97S looks at plate after plate of food, but she can't muster up an appetite.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:Truth to be told, I didn't really have a reason to go looking for the Commander... +I just... Ahhh, forget it. I'll go upstairs to get some air.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S heads to the staircase landing, where the moonlight shines through the railings onto a patch of the terrace.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I wonder if the test of courage went well—
97typeS(2);AR(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><Position>0,1500</Position>||:With a flourish of my divine brush, may the massed deities defend me, vanquishing evil in the name of peace, swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Shake>||:<size=40>WAAAAAHHHHH—!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sudden incantation bellowed right into Type 97S' ear startles her so badly that she almost jumps out of her skin. Fortunately, the railing holds her back.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Shake>||:Who-who's casting a spell— +Eh? C-Commander...?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hehe, how's that? Not bad, right? I've been practicing that for a while.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:You-you scared the hell out of me!+Although, what are you doing here, Commander?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:MG3, Type 03 and Type 63 all told me that you were looking for me at the test of courage. +So I came over to find you.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Huh? They...</color>+You said you'd join the test of courage, Commander!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry about that. I did go, but I think I kept missing you... +Then there was something I had to handle so I couldn't make it to your prize presentation either.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:So you came?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, I did. You organized everything very well. It seems I can count on you if I want to organize something like this again in the future.
97typeS(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97S looks at the Commander with a certain amount of skepticism.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh yes, have I praised your new outfit yet? It's really good, the way it was pieced together produced a really interesting effect... +As the saying goes, women can change dramatically; I can't believe you changed so much overnight!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker><Shake>||:Don't try to confuse me with weird sayings!
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hehe, I always wanted to say that... +Sorry about that. Tell you what, to make up for it, why don't we watch a zombie movie after we finish eating? Type 59 recommended me a lot of weird, old movies. +Oh yeah, you said there was something special earlier. What was that about?
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:It's nothing... I just wanted to scare you during the test of courage... +But in the end I didn't even get to see you during the event.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh...um... Why is everyone so obsessed with scaring me...? +But I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you there. As your Commander, I fear nothing and no prank can get to me. +If you wanted to hear me scream in terror, then you'd have to...ahem, never mind. You'd have to wait a long time for that.
97typeS(2)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||:I'm really interested in that "you'd have to", Commander...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Haha, the less said about it, the better. Come, let's go eat!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Commander pats Type 97S on the shoulder and turns, preparing to head down the stairs. +Type 97S nods, but the corner of her mouth curls up in a smile. +She steps up lightly, clenches her fists, then jumps with all her might and pounces the Commander—

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, hello? Yes, yes, this is the Griffin base.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hm? That order form needs to be signed in person? Could the adjutant sign instead?
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah, well, you see, our Commander is a little indisposed for the next couple of days... +No, no, the Commander's been hospitalized. Yes, it happened last night. Yes, it's because of a broken leg from a fall...
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah, I'm terribly sorry. Alright. Thank you. No, it's fine, you don't have to visit...
