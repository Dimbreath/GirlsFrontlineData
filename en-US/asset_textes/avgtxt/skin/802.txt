()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Before the Griffin anniversary.+...At the command room.
()||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Knocking sound)+Someone is at the door of the command room.
M1903(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I turn around to see Springfield smiling at me from the doorway with a stack of documents in her arms.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Good morning, Springfield. Is something the matter?
M1903(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Springfield walks in and puts the stack of documents onto the table.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, I drafted up a mission plan for the thing I mentioned to you before.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah, here you are.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Flipping through the documents)+Hm...okay, I approve. I'll leave everything to you.
M1903(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:The mission plan is very detailed and the responsibilities of all those involved are clearly laid out.+I can see that Springfield spent a lot of effort on this plan.+As I'm flipping through page by page, I can't help but think back to when Springfield initially brought this up with me.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>2.5</黑屏2><边框>2</边框>:...A day after Griffin announced the company anniversary banquet.+Command room.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Eh? Set up another party?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Well, because of the nature of the official banquet...+The Griffin T-Dolls with more of a "childlike" disposition wouldn't be invited.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Indeed, as many people from the outside will be joining us.+How should I say this... It's for the sake of the company's image. This approach is probably the safest way.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Right. I wouldn't want to see the children arguing and throwing tantrums on one side and have important people looking on with distaste on the other side.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:...Sigh... That scenario is way too realistic. I can imagine exactly who those would be.+But we rarely get a chance to have such a lively event, they must be very disappointed to not be able to participate.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:That's right, Commander. That's why I discussed about it with everyone in the evening.+They all hope to celebrate with the Commander on this memorable day.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:I want to celebrate with everyone as well. After all, we rarely get a chance to.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Hehe... I'm very happy to hear that from you, Commander.+I actually bumped into Miss Kalina earlier~+She said we can go ahead with the party as long as you agree to it~
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Haha, just as you would expect from Springfield. You're very thoughtful.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Thank you very much for the compliment, Commander. So do you approve...?
M1903(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:How about this. Write up a mission plan for me first to look over.
M1903(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1><边框>2</边框>:Yes, Commander. I'll prepare one immediately.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...On the day of the anniversary.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点2>:At the official banquet.
()||<BIN>79</BIN>:My face has become a little stiff from smiling and toasting all the guests one by one.+Just as I was looking to find a hidden corner to hide and relax, a finger suddenly pokes my face from behind me. I turn my head around instinctively yet I don't see anyone.
M1903(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I turn around the other way and I find Springfield laughing like a highschool girl.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hehe, gotcha, Commander~
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Where did you learn that from...
M1903(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Springfield pulls me aside to a corner. She stretches a bit and looks more animated now, unlike the other T-Dolls at the banquet.+Only now do I get the chance to take a good look at her attire, and she looks elegant and gentle as always.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Springfield, you are very beautiful today.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:R-really...? Do I look that different today?+....Where are you looking at, Commander?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I didn't think that there would be a moment where even someone like you would be looking so fatigued.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Eh? You can...tell?+(Whisper) You're the only one that can...
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:You haven't gotten a chance to rest this evening yet?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I can't relax on such an official occasion.+Although I am a bit tired.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Why don't you head back and get some rest?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Thank you, Commander, but I think I'll stay until the end.+If I leave before the banquet is over, the other T-Dolls that are here might get concerned.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ah, sorry, I didn't consider that. Springfield, you really are a gentle Doll.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:No no, you don't need to apologize, Commander. It's not your fault.+I actually feel quite refreshed being able to just chat with you.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Me too. I feel a lot more relaxed being able to talk with you like this.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Hehe... Being able to stay by your side like this is enough for us T-Dolls, Commander.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Eh? Why are you bringing this up out of the blue~?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:It's-it's not out of the blue at all...+We've always wanted to tell you, but we never had the right opportunity.+Everyone else and I have been very happy this past year, and I hope the upcoming year will be the same as well. Let's continue to do our best, Commander.
M1903(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Springfield smiles brightly. It feels as if my fatigue this entire evening has been blown away in this instance.+I find myself unsure of what to say and stare blankly at Springfield.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:(Red face)+...Commander?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Ah? Ah, yes, uh...
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Well, Commander, I have to get back to entertaining the guests.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Alright, careful not to wear yourself out.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I'll be careful.+Also, you must not forget about the party later tonight!
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Yes, I'll be there for sure. I promised everyone.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:I'll see you later then, Commander.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏1>:Springfield smiles at me and gives me a small bow and returns to the banquet.+Even within the group of T-Dolls wearing elegant dresses, her beauty is distinguishing in a gentle and delicate way.+The words that I couldn't say to her earlier, I think I'll find an opportunity to tell her at the party later tonight. That's what I've decided as I look up at the clock on the wall.+Everyone has worked hard, and I'm also very happy to have spent the past year with all the Dolls here.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I'll be counting on you for the upcoming year as well, Springfield.
