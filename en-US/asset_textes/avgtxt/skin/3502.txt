()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:...Right, that's all the intel we have regarding this mission. +Break into your assigned groups and get to know each other. +Dismissed.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(Our mission objective is to gather more intelligence on the mermaid.) +(This legendary creature must be very beautiful...)
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(Ahem, I'm not taking this mission just to look at a gorgeous mermaid.) +(I have a job to do, and it takes precedence over everything else!)
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(Come to think of it, the location of this mission is going to be on the seaside, isn't it? There's going to be a lot of sun...) +(I'd better bring plenty of sunscreen...) +(Oh, I must also bring...)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(Anyway, I should do as the Commander says and get to know my teammate first!)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis walks around the Dolls in heated discussion, looking for R93, and finds her sitting alone in the corner.
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Hello, I'm Lewis. +I'm also part of the investigation team. Nice to meet you!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Ahahaha... +The Commander actually chose me... +Heheh, I still can't believe it...
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Hello! +Do you hear me...?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Oh! +You're...Lewis, right?
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's right, I'm Lewis... +We'll be on the same team for this operation.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:... +......
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><shake>||:Sorry, I was busy thinking about some stuff... +Nice to meet you!
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:(The pink hair makes her look so young and energetic, and the green eyes give her this mysterious air...) +I've never carried out a mission at sea before, so I welcome all helpful tips~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:R93's face is suddenly scrunches up in a grimace as if a horrible thought has just occurred to her. 
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;R93(0)||:W...what's the matter? +R93?
Lewis(0);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Lewis, please hit me!
Lewis(0)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>;R93(0)||<黑屏1>:...Pardon?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Now go and change into your battle gear. +After that, just head straight to the designated location and start your mission. +I'll join you later to check on your progress.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:15 minutes later.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:I don't see R93 coming out? +R93, are you there?
()<Speaker>Z-62</Speaker>||:I think R93 has already set off...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Oh, is that so? Thanks!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(I can't believe R93 actually asked me to punch her that day just to prove she wasn't dreaming...) +(I ended up going all out and knocked her out cold...) +(Hopefully she has better luck today!)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Guess I'll set up camp here. The terrain is relatively flat and the view is clear. +It also makes a perfect spot to set up my parasol! +Then I'll start my surveillance here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis rummages through her massive bag for a while, then takes out her sunscreen, sunblock, tanning oil, sun cream, sun spray... +Then she sets up her parasol meticulously. Last of all, she reveals the final and and most important combat equipment— +Her fishing rod!!!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Lewis, you sure have made very extensive preparations for this mission.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's that fishing rod for?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:...Fishing?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Fishing?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:That's right. Aren't we here to search for clues about the mermaid? +As marine creatures, mermaids must be active in this area of the ocean, where the sighting was reported. +And in the murky depths of the sea, what would be more eye-catching than a shiny object? +Look at my fishing hook! It's connected to feathers, shells, and glass ornaments! +Of course, even all these might not be enough. I've even included my ultimate prize— +A waterproofed photograph of the male human idol G, the No.1 idol among the Griffin girls! +No woman...I mean, mermaid...will be able to resist!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Hmm, that's some sound reasoning. +Is everything going smoothly with the investigation team?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander! +R93 has already started her search in the designated area! +However, I have a tiny problem here...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What problem?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis suddenly lies down on her stomach, exposing her back.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I've been putting sunscreen on myself, but I can't spread it evenly on my back... +Could you help me out a bit, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Get R93 to help you when she's back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander is about to leave to check on the progress of the next team. +But Lewis grabs hold of the Commander's ankle and won't let go...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, according to my calculations, the probability of a neural meltdown is at 99% if I get sunburn.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Lewis, let go of me.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:A few hours later, only a brooding Doll with a an extremely bleak neural cloud will be left lying on the empty beach...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Alright, alright... +Give me the sunscreen...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, you look positively radiant today! +(Why do I have the feeling that somebody is staring daggers at me...)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis flips onto her stomach again under the parasol so the Commander can apply the sunscreen. +The Commander's hands seem to be trembling a little?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm done. +Continue with your mission.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander! +In return, I'll put sunscreen on you too! +Here, please lie down here~
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:N-no, thanks! +I'm in a rush...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I'll be quick then. +You don't have to be shy with me, Commander... +(I'm feeling that murderous gaze again...?)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's okay, really! +Look, your bobber is moving!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Really?!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The moment Lewis turns to look, the Commander gives her the slip.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点1>:No, it wasn't, Comman— +Huh? The Commander is gone!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Argh, I'm bored... +And where on earth has R93 run off to...?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Come to think of it, Griffin has organized idol selection contests, arm wrestling contests... +But why has there never been a beauty pageant? +I really want to watch as beautiful Dolls compete with each other on the stage...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Perhaps our main function is still to fight since we're Tactical Dolls. +But physical appearance is also very important! To me, it's a key criterion for judging a person's nature!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:The first time I saw the Commander, I knew I was looking at a person that I could depend on! +Having been through so many battles, I am still absolutely certain that my initial assessment was correct. +So it's obvious that this criterion is valid! ♪
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:I wonder what a mermaid looks like... +Is her entire body covered in scales, or is she half-human, half-fish? +Are the halves divided from left to right or top to bottom? +Is the top-half fish or is it the bottom-half?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Now that I think about it, there are so many possible combinations... +I'd better stop hypothesizing and focus on my job. +C'mon, Miss Mermaid. Get hooked already!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Two hours later.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Why hasn't Miss Mermaid fallen for the trap yet? +Could it be...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:Lewis furrows her brows, deep in thought.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Let me clear this up a bit.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Given that Miss Mermaid lives at the bottom of the sea where it's dark, it can be deduced that she is attracted to shiny things. +Then as she's swimming around in the water, she finds my shiny fish hook... +Don't tell me she sees the Oath certificate, thinks it's from a handsome merman, and passes out in excitement?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:But it's been so long already, even if she did pass out, surely she'd have woken up by now... +The now awake Miss Mermaid creeps closer to my fishing hook. +When she's close enough, she realizes that it isn't actually an Oath certificate. +Deeply disappointed, she decides to go home and have a good cry. Just as she turns around...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:She suddenly notices a photograph also attached to the fishing hook... +She takes a look absentmindedly, only to find— +An incredibly cute and handsome face... +Miss Mermaid's heart is stolen in an instant...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Don't tell me that after seeing idol G's picture, she's so smitten she decides to go find him just like that? +Then isn't G in danger right now?! +I can't let that happen! It all happened because of me! I have to go and save G—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Lewis decides to leave a comment on G's newest social media status, her bobber starts splashing around. 
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:So Miss Mermaid is only approaching my fishing hook now?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis waits for "Miss Mermaid" next move with bated breath. +As expected, the fishing bobber starts shaking violently!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Gotcha! Now let me see what you look like!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She grabs her fishing rod and starts retracting the line, but soon her effort is met with great resistance.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:... +Interesting. +Finally, someone who dares to challenge me in an arm-wrestling match.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis rolls her shoulders all the while holding firmly onto the rod. With a determined glint in her eyes, she starts reeling back the fishing line in a frenzy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The force trying to contend with Lewis gradually loses out and eventually seems to have all but given up.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Is that all you got? +I haven't even had enough yet...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis keeps reeling in her line in a leisurely manner until her trophy is dragged ashore. +To her surprise, what appears on the beach is neither Miss Mermaid nor some strange seaweed. +It's...a white bikini top trimmed with black lace.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Lewis stares in confusion, a horrific scream can be heard somewhere in the sea. +Lewis finally understands what just happened...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:This must be Miss Mermaid's swimming top! +And that scream was R93's way of telling me she just found the escaping mermaid!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:R93, keep chasing after her! +I'm going to inform the Commander of our huge discovery!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just as Lewis is about to break into a sprint, she suddenly realizes that something isn't right. She slowly turns back and directs her gaze at the fishing hook that she has put so much effort in setting up... +G's waterproofed photograph is gone!!!
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Commander! +The investigation team has made a huge discovery!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis carefully hands over the bikini top that she fished out from the sea, and the Commander makes an unfathomable face.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Isn't this R93's bikini???)
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, I fished this mermaid top from the sea. +When I got it, R93 also gave me a strong signal. +I told her to keep pursuing the mermaid while I come and make my report. <c>(R93 would probably self-destruct before letting anyone know what actually happened.) <c>(She totally wasn't signaling you. She was screaming for help.)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Right, I see. +Lewis, your team did great.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now leave the rest to me. +I'm taking this mermaid top and sending it to the lab to see if they can find anything. +(In any case, I'll just get her to hand over the bikini so I can return it to R93 in secret...)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:The Commander is about to take the bikini top, but Lewis refuses to let go.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:No, you can't! +Commander, there's something else that I need to report... +If we don't capture Miss Mermaid, I'm afraid G will be in danger...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What has this got to do with G?
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, I'm sorry. It's all my fault... +In order to lure Miss Mermaid, I used G's photograph. +But I realized that Miss Mermaid had taken the photo... +She must be deeply attracted to G's cuteness...
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:According to G's latest status update, he also happens to be filming a TV drama with a mermaid theme on an island in this area. +If Miss Mermaid runs into G as he's standing near the sea... +G might... +I can't bear to go on... +In any case, I can't just stand by and let that handsome man put himself in grave danger!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let me handle this matter with G. +Just give me the mermaid's top.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Commander, I have an idea...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Go on...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Lewis takes out a pile of G's photographs from her bag.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Right now, there are two things that can attract Miss Mermaid— +G's pictures and her own clothes. +So you take her top and I take the pictures. +If we run along the beach in opposite directions to draw her attention, she's bound to chase after either one of us. +According to my calculations, the probability that she'll come after me is 97.8%! +When that happens, you can run towards the rescue team and leave the mermaid for me to capture! <c>(I think it's time we upgraded your neural cloud...) <c>(I guess I'd rather not ask how come you have so many photos of G in your bag...)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +That's a very well-thought out plan. Let's do it! +(It's fine as long as I have the bikini top...)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Ten minutes later.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Are you nervous, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not at all.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Good! +Then run in the other direction on my mark. +Don't look back, just leave the rest to me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, got it.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Now!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, the Commander dashes off at breakneck speed. Lewis stands there in a daze, watching the Commander's back, before she also takes off in the opposite direction.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:She scatters handful after handful of G's photographs as she runs.
Lewis(2)<Speaker>Lewis</Speaker>||:Miss Mermaid, come and get me! +I have a ton of pictures of G!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:R93, I'm here to save you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Two figures are running away from each other on the enormous beach, pictures flying all around the sky. +One of them tumbles through the salty sea air, lands on the sandy beach, then eventually gets washed into the warm ocean... +A hand extends from within the waters and takes it...
