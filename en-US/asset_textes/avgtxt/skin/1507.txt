()||<BIN>86</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:As per my arrangement with Contender, I arrive at the theater and meet up with Gr G36, who has been waiting for quite some time.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're here, Master. When you told me there was a traffic jam, I expected that you'd arrive later...+May I ask what happened to your clothes and hair?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You...are you...+Gr G36...?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...My apologies, did I go overboard with this look?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No...it's just that AEK's riding really rattled me... My head hasn't fully recovered yet.
()||:While I arrived on time thanks to AEK-999, it's also because of her that my hair and clothes are in a mess.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Fortunately, it was only your clothes and head that were messed up. I expect nothing less of you, Master...+There's some time before the show begins. Please allow me to help adjust your attire.+You might be refused entry in your current state.
()||<黑屏1>:Gr G36 and I head toward break room together.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:Master, you must visit a clinic for a full checkup after this mission is over.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Are you worried that I might have suffered internal injuries? I doubt it's that bad.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:A human body isn't as strong as a Doll body, so I would advise caution on your part.+I hope that you will take care of yourself...so that you may continue to lead us.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Understood...I'll schedule an appointment. 
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:As for that reckless biker...I'll speak with her after this.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you. But don't be too harsh on her; we still need her for the upcoming battles.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:There is no need to worry. I will stay within my bounds.
()||:The makeup counter is filled with various household items that Gr G36 brought along. There are wet wipes, facial cleansers, hair wax, and even something that looks like a miniature steam iron.+Gr G36 is dressed in a straight-cut tuxedo and it doesn't look like she has the pockets to hold all these things.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36...you are really well-prepared.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:This level of preparation is only to be expected. Otherwise, I would not be able to serve you well.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm a little curious about how you managed to carry all these things on you.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:It is simply a little trick I picked up. As you know, we carry many items with us during normal operations.+While it is a technical secret...if you have a need to understand it, I can make a request to HQ for permission to demonstrate the skill to you.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahaha...there's no need for that, I was just curious.+Still, given how thoughtful you are and the outfit you're in, you really do seem just like a butler.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I am dressed this way because I need to conceal my identity as a Tactical Doll for this mission.+However, it is true that the style of this attire differs from my usual clothing... Does it seem too unnatural to you?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||: Not at all. It suits you very well. You look very mature and dependable.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:While I am taking part in this mission as your personal assistant, I am still a representative of Griffin.+I am relieved to have your approval, Master.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36...if you weren't a Tactical Doll, I would really like to hire you as my butler if given the chance.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...And if I had the chance, I would gladly serve you in such a capacity, Master.+Should I retire one day, I will give that option priority in my considerations.
()||<黑屏1>:With Gr G36's help, my clothes are quickly tidied up, and I head off to see the opera.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>96</BIN><黑屏2>:Gr G36 begins patrolling as planned inside the theater during the intermission.
M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Gr G36, can you hear me? What's your location?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:I'm in the first floor corridor. What did you find, Thompson?
G36(2);M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框>||:Bad news, it's just like what our intel said.+There are bombs in several of the empty VIP boxes on the second floor. Also, there are some suspicious-looking fellows in the vicinity as well...
G36(2);M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'm gonna see which filthy little alleyway they plan on scurrying off to. I'll leave the bombs to you.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood, I will disarm them.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:Gr G36 heads to the second floor, checking inside each of the VIP boxes and disarming any bombs she finds.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Hm, this should be the last box... It's surprisingly spacious in here.+They put enough explosives here to blow the theater's roof off... These attackers are crazy.
()||:While disarming the explosives, Gr G36 hears the sound of crying from outside the door.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...What's going on? What's this lost child doing here?+Hi, is something the matter? Where are your mommy and daddy?
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||:Uuuuwaaahhh... I can't find...my mommy and daddy...
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Hm...looks like this child got separated from his parents.+I can't just leave him here like this, but my mission isn't complete yet...and I don't have the time to find his parents.
()||:Gr G36 kneels down to comfort the crying boy.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't worry, they didn't abandon you. They asked me to look after you for the time being.
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||:But...you're busy, just like mommy and daddy always are...
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Just give me a while longer and I'll be able to keep you company. I promise.
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||:Really...?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Of course, that's the reason why Dolls...why I exist.
()||:The boy's sobbing fades away, and Gr G36 smiles as she pats his head.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I just need to work for a little bit more. Can you be a strong man for me until I finish?
()||<黑屏1>:The boy nods, and Gr G36 leads him to a sofa and sits him down.
()||<黑屏2>:15 minutes later.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...This should be the last one.
()||:Gr G36 puts the disarmed bomb into a storage locker inside the VIP box and marks it.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Alright, we'll extract these explosives after we clear everyone out of the building...+Thompson, how are things on your end?
G36(2);M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>||:I'm on my way back.+Those punks led me to a nest chock full of prey... Unfortunately, I'll have to let the cops take credit for this one.+According to them, there are eight bombs in the theater. Did you get rid of all of them?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;M1928A1(2)<通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...Wait, did you say eight bombs? I only disarmed seven.+Damn it...did I miss one?
G36(2);M1928A1(2)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框>||:Then you'd better hurry.+The opera's about to end, which means the next performance is going to start soon...
()||:Gr G36 ends the call with Thompson.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Where could the last one be?+I've checked under the cabinets and the tea tables in all of the rooms...
()||:Gr G36's eyes lock on to the sofa in the VIP box.+This box is much bigger than the others, probably one of those deluxe VIP rooms. It's furnished differently from the other rooms, with the seats swapped for a more comfortable sofa.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Don't tell me...
()||:Gr G36 carefully examines the sofa and quickly discovers the bomb hidden inside of it.+After taking the bomb out, she notices that there are less than 30 seconds left on the timer.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:There's no time to disarm it, so I'll have to throw it somewhere safe!+That's right...there's an artificial lake behind the theater... It should be right below this box!
()||<快跑><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:Gr G36 takes the bomb and sprints out of the box. She opens a window in the corridor and throws it out with all her might.
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||:...Are you leaving?
()||:With no time to reply, Gr G36 swiftly turns to tackle the boy - who had followed her out of the box - to the ground and shields him with her body.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The bomb explodes outside the window. All the glass around the corridor are blasted to bits, and the shards are sent flying everywhere.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Ergh... Are you alright?
()||:Quiet sobbing came from underneath Gr G36.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Let me see... Alright, good thing you're not hurt.+Sorry about that, those stage effects were sure over the top.+Here...take my handkerchief. Use it to wipe your tears away.
()||:Gr G36 takes the boy's little hand.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's go find your mommy and daddy together. The show's over, so it's time to go home now.
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:After the conclusion of the operation, I meet Gr G36 at the theater entrance.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Gr G36! ...Are you alright?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'm fine, Commander. I was only grazed by glass fragments when the bomb went off. Nothing more than flesh wounds.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good. After Thompson reported that you were in charge of bomb disposal...I got really worried when the explosion happened.
G36(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G36's eyes suddenly turn dull.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Master.+You specifically chose me to handle this mission, yet I could not disarm all of the bombs...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, Gr G36, you've done very well.+Not only did you stop the scheme to blow up the theater, you've also helped evacuate a lot of civilians and prevented many deaths.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't believe my assessment?+Take a look over there.
()||:Gr G36 looks in the direction of my finger.+The boy she rescued earlier is standing by his parents, waving happily to her in farewell.
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||:Thank you!
小男孩()<Speaker>Little Boy</Speaker>||<震屏>:Big brother!
()||:Gr G36 and I freeze for a moment upon hearing his words.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:......
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not going to explain?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I'll let it go this time...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So was this a successful performance for you as well?
 ()||:Gr G36 smiles.
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Indeed, Master.+Oh yes, you must be bone-tired today. Please allow me to serve you once we get back.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, I didn't expect watching an opera to be so tough... Gr G36, can you rescue my stomach afterward?
G36(2)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But of course, Master.+I, Gr G36, will not disappoint you.
