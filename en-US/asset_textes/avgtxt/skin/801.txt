()||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_Daily</BGM>:...At the T-Doll dormitory.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点1>:Aha, the anniversary banquet is finally here once again! What should I wear for my battle robe...? Let's go with this! I'm sure to become the center of attention this time! Hehe...
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:...In the command room on a certain day before the banquet. 
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Com~ man~ der!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:What is it, Skorpion? You seem happy today.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, where's mine? Where's mine?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Your what? Meat for your lunch? Did the machine gun T-Dolls take all the meat again?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:?...No, even though that's another problem, it's not the time to talk about that... +Commander! Is there something wrong with our base's mail service?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:No, everything's working properly. Is there a problem?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:It's the invitations for the anniversary banquet! +I just saw Mosin-Nagant with one, so how come I haven't received mine yet?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah, about that... +Since we're inviting so many people from outside of the company, the official banquet isn't open to everyone. +(I check the list, but unsurprisingly, Skorpion's name isn't on it.)
VZ61(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Skorpion lowers her head with an expression even sadder than the one she usually wears when she isn't able to snatch any meat.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Silent)......
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Skorpion?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Silent)......
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah, right, I'm supposed to contact the engineering department if a T-Doll crashes. What was the phone number again...?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:Uwaaaaaaaaaaah!!
VZ61(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Skorpion bursts out crying, scaring me.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:W-What is it, Skorpion? +Why are you crying all of a sudden?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sobbing)...Why did this happen...? +I put so much effort into preparing my dress...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hold on, Skorpion, actually...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sobbing)...+...I looked over so many dress illustrations...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sobbing)...+...I went to consult with the clothing department so many times...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That's why I'm trying to say...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sobbing)...+Even though I worked so hard...
VZ61(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:I quickly grab hold of Skorpion's shoulders and shake her with all my might. +She turns and looks at me, wide-eyed, as if she had just woken up from a nightmare.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Have you calmed down?+I'll send you to the café if you're not okay, alright?
VZ61(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:She nods quickly, before vigorously shaking her head and composing herself. +I smile helplessly and let go of her.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>: For this anniversary, we're organizing not only a banquet. +On the same night, there will be a party on base, held specifically for the T-Dolls who weren't invited to the official banquet. +That's why you don't have to be so depressed.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:(Abruptly raising her head) R-really?! That means...
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Yes, exactly.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Commander, I might arrive later than the others, but! +You have to wait for the moment I arrive in my magnificent dress, you absolutely have to!
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Looks like it's going to be a surprise, huh? I'm looking forward to it.
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Of course! It's a promise!
()||<BIN>8</BIN>:Skorpion happily skips out of the command room, forgetting to close the door as usual.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>: Phew. Just as what you would expect from Skorpion, being able to cheer up so quickly. +It's a good thing she didn't ask why she wasn't invited to the official banquet... Yep, that's just like her.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:...At the Griffin anniversary party.
Griffin T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Is that Skorpion? She looks so pretty. Just like a queen.
Griffin T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That dress looks amazing! +It's completely different from the boyish clothing she usually wears.
Griffin T-Doll()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Umu, I want to take a selfie with Skorpion later...
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Awesome! Choosing this dress was the right choice after all, everyone's praising me~ +Being the center of attention is such an amazing feeling!
VZ61(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:With a proud smile on her face, Skorpion walks gracefully past the group of T-Dolls and approached the Commander. +She tiptoes and spins in a circle, before leaning in slightly as she stared and blinked at the Commander.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What a pleasant surprise. Looks like it was worth the wait after all.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That's because it was a prom~ise~, hehe~ +Commander, Commander, who's the prettiest person at the party tonight?
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ahem. Of course that would be you, Skorpion.
VZ61(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Skorpion happily spins in a circle, but this time almost hitting a head full of golden hair.
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ah, sorry, sorry...
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Haa? It's you.
VZ61(2);SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hmph. Your evasion is not bad. +You're actually a handgun T-Doll, aren't you?
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;SR3MP(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hey! What're you talking about, you lewd bunny! It's obvious I'm the star of tonight's banquet! +Want me to burn your hair off?
VZ61(2);SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ha! You'd go as far as fighting another T-Doll for the title of [Tonight's Star]? Maybe you should burn yourself!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;SR3MP(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Youyouyouyouyou! +Hmph! You're just trying to show off your messy, revealing dress. Dream on!
VZ61(2);SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Tch. I'll give you three seconds to apologize.+Otherwise, I'll dismantle you and turn you into some fireworks to liven things up!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Don't even think about it, You lewd bunny!
SR3MP(2)<Speaker>SR-3MP</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:You smelly scorpion!
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:(Both of them turning to face the Commander at the same time) You decide! Com! Man! Der!
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:As I opened my mouth to say something, a chill ran up my spine. +Suddenly, a T-Doll clapped her hands and leisurely strolled over.
M1918(2)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Okay, okay... Both of you are being really noisy... +Are you two competing to be the noisiest T-Doll here tonight?
M1918(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:M1918 winks at me with a relaxed expression on her face.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>2.5</黑屏2><黑屏1>:(Sighing in relief) Looks like everything will be fine... +Ah, there's Mosin-Nagant and 416 having a drinking competition... +(Rubs forehead) Looks like things will not be ending quietly tonight...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Though, seeing everyone enjoying themselves so much isn't such a bad thing. +This is their party, after all.
