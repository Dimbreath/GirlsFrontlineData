()||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The sapphire seas, the azure skies, all without a cloud in sight — this beautiful scenery should be filling me with joy. +But the sun overhead stings my eyes, and even with sunglasses I can't look directly at it. +It's probably because I had spent most of the past six months living in the shade, and thus had not seen the sun for too long. +In addition...I had thought this was just an ordinary company-sponsored trip, but after seeing AK-12 and AN-94, I realized that it can't be that simple. +Countless questions tumble through my mind and refuse to leave me alone, making it impossible for me to relax and enjoy this holiday.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Master! Master! Come look! It's awesome! I just dug a hole and the tide came in and it got filled up right away!
()||:...But there's someone here who can't read between the lines. Just hearing her is enough to make my troubles melt away like my sundae under the sun.
G41(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The T-Doll with the pale golden animal ears, wearing a white, figure-hugging swimsuit with her designation tackily written on the front, gleefully proclaims her new discovery at the boundary where the land meets the sea.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:What if I dig a waaaaay bigger hole? Will the same thing happen? What do you think, Master?
()||:That said...
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's the story behind that swimsuit of yours? Did you request it from Gr G36 as well? But if I remember correctly, the ones she got for everyone else were of a different style...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:(Shakes head) Nope.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So what's with it, then?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:When I was buying snacks from Miss Kalina, I told her about going to the beach for a vacation... +...And then she said she had a swimsuit in the previous century's style, and that you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off me once I wore it, Commander.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So it was her... I was just thinking that you wouldn't make a joke like this, Gr G41. +Still, did I do anything which would leave such an unsightly impression on her...? I didn't, right?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Oh yes, Master! Want to come dig a hole with me? Let's dig a bigger one and see if the sea can wash it away!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah... Gr G41, there's something I need to think about right now... +Could you give me a moment? I just need some time to think. It won't take long.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Yes, Master!
()||:About what I just saw... Is AN-94 the only one with AK-12? Or have she brought the others with her? Does HQ know of their existence? +And why did she suddenly bring up a beach volleyball match? Was it a simple wager? Was it to cover something up? +Come to think about it, why is the company even organizing a seaside vacation on the company dollar at such a crucial and busy time?
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Rustle, rustle, rustle... a strange, repetitive sound reaches my ears. It's clearly not the tide washing in.
()||:I turn back, and see Gr G41 hopping from foot to foot on the patch of sand beside me.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What are you doing? Is there a malfunction somewhere?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:Huh? No, Master! It's just that the sand's very hot!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hot enough to cause a doll discomfort... Must be pretty hot then... +If it's that scalding, go look for Gr G36. I asked her to prepare beachwear for everyone, that ought to include sandals for you.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:Don't worry about me, Master! You said it wouldn't take long and I believe you! There's no need to trouble Gr G36 because of this.
G41(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I freeze for a moment, and then laugh awkwardly to hide the careless promise I had made earlier.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You must have gotten tired of waiting there for so long, right? I'm sorry, it was my fault. I shouldn't have made you wait out here under the sun.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:It's nothing like that at all! I'll faithfully carry out any orders that you give me, Master! +...Though what I'd most like to do is to have fun with you.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Suddenly inspired) Ah, that's it. As it happens, I have a mission for you...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:A mission? What kind of mission? I'm listening!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:W, actually, those two T-Dolls just now...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Uh-huh, uh-huh!
()||:After hearing me explain the cause of my chagrin, Gr G41 takes a deep breath and pounds herself on the chest, where her name is written on her swimsuit.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Master! Just leave it to me! +I'll deal with anyone who dares to take on Griffin or you, Master! +The contest or beach volleyball or whatever, none of that is a problem!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do your best, then~ +If you win, I'll make sure you're well rewarded~
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oooh, a reward from the Commander! Then there's no way I'll lose!
()||<BIN>162</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oww, my head...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Master... I'm sorry... +I didn't expect that weird T-Doll to whack the ball at your face right away...
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't worry, there isn't a limit to how many players we can have on our side anyway... +Just think of the first set as me probing their strength for you guys. I'll be counting on you all from now on!
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:Got it! Leave the next match to me! +I won't let your sacrifice be in vain, Master!
()||:...That said, as I watch Gr G41 confidently step onto the court, I realise something.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Come to think of it, Gr G41's the kind of T-Doll who doesn't even know how to pick clothes for herself... Does she even know what beach volleyball is?)
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:This is Gr G41! I'm ready to go! Please watch me, Master!
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:...Ah.
()||:...The referee blows the whistle.
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Gr G41 moved while hugging the ball. Foul for Griffin.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Huh? Why is that a foul? +Isn't volleyball about taking the ball and hitting the other person with it?
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(I knew it—)
G41(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...It can't even be considered a match. The whistle was blown every five seconds during the first three minutes of the match. +And while our opponent AN-94 has a blank expression on her face, she clearly knows how to play volleyball.
AN94(6)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;G41(2)||:Serving.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:That's strange... I'm standing here...so why did you hit the ball to that empty corner?
AK12(7)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Griffin made an error. Task Force DEFY scores with a service ace.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:What's an error? I didn't get hit by the ball, did I?
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(We're finished... How should I explain this to her...)
()||:...And so the second set against Task Force DEFY comes to an end. +The match also comes to an end, by way of an overwhelming difference in score. +Gr G41, who appeared puzzled even when told that we lost, turns around and walks toward me.
G41(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:As I watch Gr G41 walk back to me with a blank look on her face, I scramble to think of something nice to say in order to comfort her.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...it's alright, you did your best...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:While I'm not quite sure what's going on... That was the most intense workout I've had in a while! +It's even more fun than being on the battlefield!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Eh?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:It feels like, how should I put this... Why have I never tried this before? It's strange! +I didn't know beach volleyball is so much fun! Master, can we get a beach volleyball practice room in the base after we go back?
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(She doesn't look demoralized at all... In fact, she looks really happy.)
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then, do you think you won?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:Ah...! +I totally forgot. +I'm sorry, Master... I disappointed you... I let you down...
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You did no such thing.
G41(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:I pat Gr G41 gently on the head.
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Winning and losing is common in war, and competitions are the same as work. +Since you put in the effort, you ought to be rewarded even if you didn't gain the results you were hoping for.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker>||:What do you mean, Master?
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Come, let's go play in the sand. Don't you have a lot to tell me? +Consider it a reward for finishing the entire match with such sportsmanlike spirit.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Shake>||:Yaaaaay! That's wonderful, Master—!
()||:Rather than worrying about what the inscrutable Task Force Defy is up to, the most important thing for me is to take care of my people. +Also, relaxing and enjoying my vacation is just as important. +As long as I'm by Gr G41's side, I can empty my mind of all unnecessary thoughts and focus solely on the simple, childlike pleasure of playing around.
()||:Perhaps that's my greatest discovery on this short-lived vacation.
