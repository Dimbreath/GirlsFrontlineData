()||<BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Griffin squad proceeds with the cleanup work as planned after the police were done arresting the suspects of the attack group at the theater.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:This way, Commander.
MG5(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:Walking ahead of me, Gr MG5 uses her kukri to hack a path through the vegetation.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They really know how to inconvenience people, running so far into the wilderness like this.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:We Dolls can handle search operations like this by ourselves.+There's no need for you to personally come down here, Commander. 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's best that I'm present since this job involves interacting with humans from other organizations.+Also...since our targets for this mission are also humans, I'd like to bear witness to the operation.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:I see... Human affairs are quite complicated.+Please don't stray too far from me, Commander. Who knows if we'll run into any escapees from the attacker group around here.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ugh... I haven't moved around outdoors in a while. I feel like I can't quite keep up.+In any case, you'll protect me from the attackers, right?
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:...But of course. However, that doesn't mean you can allow yourself to get careless, Commander.+Human attackers aside, there may also be other dangerous lifeforms in this wilderness.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ack, really? Then I'll have to stay close to you.+Now that you mention it, you do seem quite familiar with the wilderness, Gr MG5.+That outfit of yours looks like it's made for camping outdoors.
MG5(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG5 is wearing a set of loose clothing and a brimmed cap. The backpack she's carrying is fully stocked with gear such as a water bottle and a folding chair and the like.+If not for the machine gun on her back, she would be the very image of an outdoors explorer.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Given the circumstances, dressing like this helps in moving around.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It must have cost a lot to put this outfit together. Do you spend a lot of time outdoors?
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Yeah...I usually get out like this by myself. 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You camp outdoors all by yourself?
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought you preferred hanging around the other Dolls.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:I don't dislike being around my friends...+It's just that sometimes...I need to be alone.+Ah, we've reached our destination, Commander.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, let's take a break after we search this area.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:An hour later. Search complete.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2>:The search is complete, Commander. No traces of the enemy.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't find anything on my side either.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:The others haven't finished searching yet. Would you like to rest here for now, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, we'll wait for the others to contact us.+We can pack up and go home if they don't find anything.
MG5(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Gr MG5 unfolds her folding chair in a small clearing in the woods.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Please wait, Commander.+I'll prepare a hot drink to warm you up.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you, Gr MG5.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Think nothing of it, Commander. My power is yours to use in the first place.
MG5(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG5 sets up a stove and starts a fire in a skilled fashion, and soon enough, a cup of piping hot coffee is delivered to my hands.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander. This is the best I could do with what I've got.+Although it is only ordinary instant coffee, I'm sure that it'll be able to refresh your senses.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's fine, Gr MG5. This is an excellent drink as is.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, I did not bring along milk or sugar...so I couldn't adjust the flavor. 
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I may be human, but I'm hardly that demanding.+Mmm, mmm...this coffee tastes fine.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:That's good to hear.
()||:Gr MG5 sits down opposite of me, holding her own cup of coffee.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Commander...what do you think of this incident?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think...this incident was just an ordinary terrorist attack.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Actually, there's one thing I don't quite understand...+Why do humans still fight each other when there's an enemy like Sangvis Ferri around?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You sure chose a difficult question for me to answer.+How shall I put this... In truth, humans fighting humans is very much like how you fight Sangvis.+Or rather, your battles are simply extensions of the fighting between humans.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:...I don't quite understand after all.+For us, carrying out orders is simpler.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Actually, for people like us, protecting the people close to us is enough.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Like say, protecting your friends?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes, that's a part of it.+If you have a goal that you want to achieve, then there's a value in fighting.+I feel that in that regard, both humans and Dolls are the same.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:As for me...I want all the friends who fight with me to come back safely each time.+That includes you too, Commander. I want everyone to achieve victory safely.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You really are a gentle person, Gr MG5.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||<震屏>:...What are you saying all of a sudden?+If you don't drink your coffee soon, it'll get cold.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, I'll drink it.
()||:...Beep. I receive the signal to begin operations.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:See, you're out of time.
MG5(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I hurriedly gulp the coffee down and wipe my mouth.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go on a real outdoors hike next time. The kind where there's no enemies, only friends.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Are you willing to treat a Doll as a friend, Commander?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Can't I? I enjoy simple things too.
MG5(4)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander...+I also...enjoy the time I spend with you very much.
MG5()<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Then it's a promise.+Next time, we'll go on a real hike.
