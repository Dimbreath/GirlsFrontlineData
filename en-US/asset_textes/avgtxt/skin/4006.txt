()||<黑屏2><BIN>81</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:... +Slightly later, in the café.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:It sure takes up a lot of space.
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Yes, I didn't expect the Commander and Lewis to bring such a big pine tree back.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;M1903(2)||:...I don't get it. What use does it have? And it's even gotten the floor dirty. +...There's mud everywhere.
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It IS a little messy, and it needs a little trimming before it can be used. +However, I'm sure it'll be a very pretty Christmas tree once we decorate it.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;M1903(2)||:Can't we use a fake tree...?
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:While it's not like we can't... Don't you think that would be very boring? +Come to think of it, you've been here since morning, Gepard. +Aren't you bored?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;M1903(2)||:Vacations don't come around often... So I wanted to spend mine lazing around. +Also...the coffee you make is very much to my taste, Miss Springfield.
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I see... Thank you very much, then. Would you like a refill?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;M1903(2)||:Please and thank you...
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm, I still need to check on the expenses after I do the cleaning. Looks like I'll be very busy today. +Are you going to be staying here by yourself after this?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;M1903(2)||:I guess so... I don't mind. +I'm fine being alone.
GepardM1(6);M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Alright then, I'll have to trouble you to mind the café.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Miss Springfield! +Huh... Miss Springfield isn't in?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Miss Kalina... If you're looking for Miss Springfield, she just stepped out to do something else.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, that's a headache...
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:...You look really busy too, Miss Kalina. What's going on?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm rushing to finish the Christmas party preparations. Lewis ran the Commander so ragged that I can't get them up. +So right now, I'm in charge of making sure everything's going smoothly.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I see... In that case, why were you looking for Miss Springfield?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hm... You saw it too, right?
()||:Kalina points at the pine tree standing in the middle of the café with her file.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Lewis and the Commander brought that back after expending a great deal of effort. +Naturally, Lewis was the one providing the muscle.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:Hm... I was talking about it with Miss Springfield just now... +What's with it? Is it causing other problems besides taking up a lot of space?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You sound like you have a grudge against that tree... Well, it's not that bad.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But look, don't you think this tree's crown is a bit too broad for a Christmas tree? And it's got a lot of mud and snow on it. +We can't use it as a Christmas tree if it's not cleaned and trimmed.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:So are you here to trim it, Miss Kalina?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Haha... I'd do it if I could. Unfortunately, with my skills, I wouldn't be done even if I worked on it until nightfall.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Also, I have other things to do. We're very understaffed at the moment. +I actually came here to ask Springfield if she could spare someone to help me out, but I guess that's a bust.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||:I see... I still don't get it, though. Why do you have to go out of your way to do these things?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What do you mean by "these things"?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Why do you have to go to such trouble on a day that's supposed to be a holiday...? +I mean, you could make a Christmas tree or whatever out of plastic, right? +And when you get down to it...you're just doing overtime on a holiday to prepare for a Christmas party. Isn't that strange?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Hmm... I see. +You don't quite understand these "strenuous vacations", do you, Miss Gepard?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I guess you could say that... +Although the Christmas party makes me very happy... It also means you and Miss Springfield are busy and tired. +That's really worrying.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Haha, no need to worry about us. That's very kind of you, Miss Gepard.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Let me think... +Were you with Miss Springfield this morning, Miss Gepard?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Yeah... Miss Springfield was here all morning. +But she had to work too, so we didn't manage to talk.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Did Miss Springfield look like she was having a hard time, Miss Gepard?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:Kind of... I've never been that way even during workdays. +Or rather...I felt guilty, like Miss Springfield was the only one without vacation days.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Then, did Miss Springfield look unhappy to you?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:... +...Not really. +She looked like...she was enjoying herself.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's how it is. Maybe everyone enjoys their vacation in different ways, but ultimately they do it to make themselves happy. +Some of them are like you, Miss Gepard, and want to spend their vacation in leisure. As for Miss Springfield, she feels happier when everyone can enjoy their Christmas.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:When everyone can enjoy their Christmas...
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course, I'm not saying that there's anything wrong with spending your holidays in a leisurely manner! It's just a different way of enjoying yourself.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:It sounds like... +You and Miss Springfield consider everyone's vacations to be your vacations.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, I wouldn't go that far. +And in my case, the Commander gives an overtime allowance, so it's not a bad deal.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:...That sure sounds nice, but in the end you're still doing overtime, Miss Kalina.
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's right! That's exactly it!
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah... Oh no, I spent too much time talking. I need to go. +There's so much more work to do... If I can't find anyone to do the trimming for me, I guess I'll have to put it aside for now.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Does it HAVE to be trimmed?
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It'll look awful if we just decorated it as-is. +If it really can't be helped, I'll take your suggestion into consideration and just use an artificial tree for the sake of convenience. +Though that'll have to wait until the Commander wakes up.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'll be off, then. Too bad Miss Springfield wasn't around, otherwise I could have taken a coffee with me.
()||:Kalina rushes out of the café.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:...She sure is busy.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The cup of coffee in Gepard's hands has gone from scalding hot to warm.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Quit rubbing up against my legs...bad kitty. +I know, I know... +Vacations don't grow on trees...and neither do Christmases.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑点2><震屏3>:Why didn't you wake me up earlier?
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? Was that my job?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But you were the one who was so tired that you couldn't wake up at all, Commander. Next time, you should let someone appropriate do that sort of work.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lewis did most of it, though... I don't even know what got me so tired... +So, you haven't found anyone to trim the tree yet?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Nope. +I went to look for Miss Springfield after that, but she was sorting out the list of food ingredients with LWMMG, and I couldn't find anyone I could ask to do it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It can't be helped, then... Let's go, Kalina. The trimming's up to the two of us!
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehhhhhh?! But I just said you should let someone appropriate do that sort of work!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But there's no other way, is there?! Lewis went to so much effort to bring that tree back! Are you telling me you're going to let it go to waste...? +Oh hey, good morning, Gepard.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:It's not morning anymore, Commander.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er...yeah, it's already afternoon. There's still... +Are you waiting here for the party to start?
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:...Not really. +I've been lazing around here since morning. +There are cats and coffee here, and it's very quiet.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see... That sounds really relaxing... +I have to hand it to you, Gepard. That's a model vacation.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:...This is a model vacation?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Commander—!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What-what happened?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What do you mean, what happened... Come take a look for yourself.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...ehhhhh?
()||:The broad crown of the pine tree in the café has been trimmed into a slender cone, while the mud and bark on the trunk have been scraped off. Now it looks just like a Christmas tree; all it needs are the decorations and presents.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Didn't you say you couldn't find anyone to trim it...?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But I didn't...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then what's all this? I ran over here in such a hurry... Could the fairies have done it?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Even if you ask me, I...
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...
GepardM1(6);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Huh? Miss Gepard's hands are covered in mud...</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...I see!</color>+I have no idea what's going on!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...You clearly look like you know something! Come on, spill it!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I don't know. +It might have been Santa Claus.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Come on, tell me!
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||:... +...How noisy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As M1 Gepard quietly grumbles to herself, she gently strokes the kitty that's rubbing up against her.
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Still...
GepardM1(6)<Speaker>Gepard M1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:I do feel very happy.
