Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Is this the Commander? Why would the Commander contact me at a time like this...)</color>+Good evening, Commander. +You ought to be off work. Are you putting in overtime?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If worrying about how you might misunderstand the invitation counts as overtime, then perhaps it is — the unpaid kind.</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Am I misunderstanding something? Isn't it work?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course not, it's R&R.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>There'll be several other Dolls going with you, but you don't need to head there together.</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:So we're going to have fun? +Not to work, but to relax and have fun... +Is this a holiday?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right.</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:In that case, can I bring my friends along?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>As long as they don't have any missions in progress.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Who do you have in mind?</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I was thinking of M950A, is she free?

NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>That would have to be done beforehand, and she's already set out. </color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's how it is. I'm very sorry, Thunder. Do you have anyone else in mind?</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then go and enjoy yourself as much as you like — that said, you'll need to mind your personal image, as you will be attending as a Griffin representative, after all.</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...Understood. +I'll be at the party on time and I'll have a dress ready.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you upset because you can't bring a friend along to the party?</color>
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:That's not important. +The schedule's been arranged, and I will go.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:The next evening. +After the party officially begins, even the most elegant and dignified people soon end up talking and laughing loudly in the festive atmosphere. +I had thought that given the mood in the air, finding Thunder would be difficult, but in fact it only takes a minute to track her down. +She is standing by the dessert table, discussing something with a person dressed like a chef. +How surprising. I decide against interrupting the conversation and instead wait until the chef has left.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good evening, Thunder.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Ah, it's you, Commander.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She is still holding a plate of desserts, and she seems very relaxed as she looks toward me. +However, her face soon reverts back to its usual impassive state, and it makes me wonder if I had imagined the look of childish excitement I just saw.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You look very beautiful in that dress.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander. You look very presentable as well.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>She replied way too fast, that must have been a pre-programmed response, right?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Speaking of which, it wouldn't be strange for her to have something like that, given her previous job...</color>+Are the desserts here good?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:This one, and this one, and this one...they're all delicious. Would you like to try some, Commander? +It's called "Bitter Rock'n'Roll".
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:"Bitter Rock'n'Roll"? The chefs here sure give their work some...interesting names.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I was the one who suggested it.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see...then don't mind if I do. +...+I can't believe how good this is.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I think it's quite delicious as well. +And this one over here, I'd like to name it "The Third Color Rivaled by None." +As for this one, I'd like to call it "Puppy Love". I haven't figured out what to call these two round ones yet... 
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They're all interesting names. It looks like you're enjoying yourself, which is a weight off my shoulders.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:The person who made these came over and spoke to me. He said that they were all experimental works with no names. +It would be a shame to let these delicious things go into the belly without a name. +Therefore, I wanted to give them names before eating them. +That way, when I remember this event, I can call each of them by name.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Commander? +Did I say something bad?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not at all. +That gesture of yours is very...romantic. Yes, that's the word for it. +I recall that M950A also did something very romantic during the anniversary party several years back.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:What did she do? +I'd like to know.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... +When the party was nearing its conclusion, she jolted all the drowsy people awake with her vigorous voice. +"Listen to my song!" she said. +Back then, the way she stood on stage, shouting with total self-confidence and reigniting the mood...it's as brilliant now when I think about it as it was then.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I like her very much.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She's very likable when she's like that. Just like you.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Likable...huh. +Are you praising me, or is there some other meaning to it, Commander?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course I'm praising you.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Please help yourself.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Saying so, Thunder offers her scarred arm to me.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Huh?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:I won't cry out in pain, so please do whatever you want.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think you've gotten the wrong idea, Thunder. +That wasn't what I meant.... This is not your previous "workplace"+I've got a rough idea of what happened in the past, but I won't do things like that.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thunder looks at me in confusion.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...I admit, some humans are scum, the kind who would commit such... abuse against dolls and even their own kind. +But there's nobody like that in Griffin. You may wear a beautiful dress and taste desserts freely here and do whatever you want on your holidays. +See, even if you call it "Bitter Rock and Roll", ice cream on coffee is still sweet.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I think I know what you're trying to say. +You are comforting me. +However, there is no need to comfort Dolls.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm telling you the truth, Thunder. +What you experienced in the past won't happen again in Griffin. +Even if I order you to do anything...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I will obey your orders.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I have only one order for you— +"Seek your happiness to your heart's content, Thunder."
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...I still don't understand why you're doing this. +But if it's an order, then I will do my best to complete it.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If it makes you feel better, then go ahead and do so.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Then, may I continue naming the desserts?
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. Like I said before, you can do what you want when you're on holiday. +Go ahead and do what you'd like.
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I understand...
Thunder50(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1><黑屏1>:...Wait a minute, what are you doing, hold on, Thunder! Don't pull out your gun at a party—!!
