指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...That concludes the details of the mission.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...+Do you really think it's a good idea to have me participate in this mission?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Why not?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You know, I'll only be wasting everyone's time.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:The roster is decided by IOP and the client.+Since your name is on this list, it means they think you're capable of accomplishing the task.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Do you have any other concerns, Vector?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:It makes no difference if I do or not.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You wouldn't be wrong to say that.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'll go if they insist, but I hope they won't regret it after seeing the pictures.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Vector...aren't you excited at all?+This is a wedding dress shoot.+The others were jumping with joy after hearing the news.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:It's not like we're the actual brides. Having expectations will only result in that much more disappointment.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(So in other words, she DOES want to wear the wedding dress...)+Oh...alright, I can respect your opinion.+Then, the mission is...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I will complete it to an acceptable standard.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:Alright, I'll be counting on you, Vector.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点2>:The day of the photo shoot.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:I began my patrol of the building after watching Five-seven's shoot for a while. Although I had thoroughly examined the personnel and inspected the equipment yesterday, I feel it is still sensible to walk around the venue, just in case.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:In addition to Five-seven's shoot, several other rooms are also in use.+Vector emerges from the dressing room as I approach its door.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ve-Vector?!
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:What's the matter, Commander?+Do you see a bomb in the dressing room?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:N-No.+It's just that you look so different from usual that I'm at a loss for words.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...I apologize if I frightened you.+They want us to bring our weapons along for the shoot, so we must look like very dangerous brides.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:N-Not at all...+I think this dress suits you very well.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:There's no need to be considerate, Commander...+I take it that I'm the last one out?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Yes, the others have already started.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:This is apparently the length of a proper bridal train... It was very troublesome to put on.+A lot of time was spent only on attaching the hair extensions, and frankly speaking, the dress is a little tight around the chest...
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:It must've been hard for you.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I can't complain if it's for the sake of the mission...+But the human women who take these photos must have it very hard.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:For humans, enduring this bit of hardship in exchange for the sweet memories is worth the price.+Just being able to wear a wedding dress like this is joy in itself for some women.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Is that so?+That's not something that I can understand... It's too pitiful to ascribe so much meaning to just a piece of clothing.+(Quietly) Just like ourselves...
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ah...you'll understand some day...+But for now, let's focus on the mission.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑点1>:I hear her voice, but she has already sidestepped the issue in a practiced fashion.
()||<BIN>136</BIN><黑点2>:The shoot goes on as planned.+Two camera crews are changing locations at the same time as I enter the largest studio room.+We have to protect our mission objectives - the true newlyweds who are moving to the next room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Vector watches them leave with that familiar expressionless gaze of hers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Did the shoot go well, Vector?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Other than the photographer's complaints about my expression, it went fine.+Commander, are those two people the ones we're assigned to protect?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Yes, the true purpose of this mission is to ensure they can safely take wedding pictures.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:If they're worried about being attacked then why not clear everyone out of the building so they'd be the only ones having their photos taken?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:That would ruin the atmosphere.+It'd be hard to feel happy when the corridors are empty except for guards with guns.+While they're scions of high society...they still want to lead a normal life, to a certain extent.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Then why are we still carrying our guns?
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:They believe these are props for a special themed photo shoot for our company.+Our client went to a great deal of effort to ensure their child could have a perfect wedding experience. 
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:...So the two of them are being kept in the dark.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Don't tell anyone, Vector.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:I'm not one to leak secrets, Commander.+Not like I have anyone to tell, anyway.
Vector(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Vector looks at the door of the studio room, where the true couple are walking toward the next location with a spring in their steps.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:They look very happy.+Yet they have no clue that they're being protected by a lie.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Vector...
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:And I'm nothing more than a part of this lie.+In any case, I ought to resume playing my part now.
()||<BIN>136</BIN>:A staff member and I lift up the train and veil of Vector's wedding dress and move her to the platform in the center of the studio.+The fabric is embroidered with patterns made from tiny crystals and it's quite heavy. To a true bride, it would probably be a weighty joy.+Vector stands steady on top of a short wooden box as a staff member helps her adjust her dress.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:You've been staring at me for quite a while now, Commander.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Ehm... Vector, there's something I'd like to tell you.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:You don't need my permission to give me orders.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:It's not an order, Vector.+Although we're here on business...I still hope that you and everyone else can enjoy the experience today.+So don't think too much about the mission. Consider today to be taking artistic photos for yourself.+That way...perhaps you might feel a little better.
Vector(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Vector falls silent.+Perhaps I'm imagining things, but for a moment, I thought I saw a slight hint of movement on Vector's expressionless face.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Even if you say so...I can't turn a hollow act into reality, Commander.
Vector(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN>:Vector looks at the candle stand beside her. The flickering flames leave a warm glow in her eyes.
Vector(4)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><黑屏1>:But...+It doesn't feel too bad to have the occasional moment of fleeting bliss.+At the very least, that moment is real, right?
