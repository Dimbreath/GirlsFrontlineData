指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Spring Festival? +How's that different from a regular New Year?
81typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:It's not the same, Commander. +For us in the East, it's not just for ushering in the new year. More importantly, it's an occasion for us to put down our daily burdens and get together. +Spring Festival is fast approaching, but Type 95, Type 64 and the others have all been sent elsewhere for various missions recently...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(It seems Spring Festival is as important to them as New Year and Christmas combined...) +I see, so that's why you want to be the organizer for this celebration. +I'll think about it, but I'll need to see a list of the people involved in the preparations and a list of the resources required...
81typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:That won't be a problem. When we did this in the past, the Dolls from other regions thought that this Eastern festival was lots of fun! +And when it comes to the Spring Festival, the more the merrier.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, hearing the organizer say that puts me at ease. +In that case, I'll let you handle this. Hopefully Type 95 and the others will be surprised when they come back.
81typeR(0)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I'm sure they will! Please help us keep it a secret until then, Commander!
()||<BIN>83</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A week before Spring Festival...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The various prep teams for the celebration are starting to deliver results. +While progress on the fireworks is a bit behind, S.A.T.8 should have no trouble with it. +Let's see...the next item to check is...
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Here's your ticket. +You need one of these to redeem your red packet at the event. Please keep it safe. 
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Yep, I will! Thank you!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So there you are, Type 81R. +Is this your Spring Festival dress? It seems a little plainer than what the other Dolls are wearing.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Ah, you're here, Commander! +I prefer subdued patterns like this. They look very soothing. Does it look nice?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course it does! +(Though this would actually be rather eye-catching when everyone is dressed in fiery red, wouldn't it?) +Still, what are you doing? +I know about the red packets and Spring Festival...but why are you handing out tickets to everyone?
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Well, it's like this... +According to my neural cloud records, the people of my home country would use train tickets like these to get home. +Back then, getting the tickets to go home was a real ordeal... One practically had to fight for them.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think...I've heard Hawk and the others talk about this before.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Yes, and when those people finally managed to get their tickets, their hearts must have been filled with joy and anticipation... +Which is why I made Spring Festival tickets like these...so that everyone can feel the same way.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I see, so that's what you had in mind. +Still, I've never taken a long-haul train before... After all, there are many more quicker means of transport in this day and age.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:It's alright if you haven't taken a train before. Just look forward to your red packet! +Come, here's your ticket, Commander. Please take good care of it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There's even one for me?
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Everyone should have a ticket home! It's essential! +Even you are are no exception, Commander!
()||<BIN>86</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:The morning of Spring Festival Eve. +Type 81R goes outside the base ahead of time to welcome her friends back from their assignments abroad, and leads everyone in a "homecoming" ceremony. +All the Dolls, both the newly returned and the ones stationed at the base, present their train tickets to Type 81R.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Hello! Please show your tickets. +Alright, welcome home! Don't forget to collect your red packets from Gd DSR-50.
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Wow, thanks! +Let's go, FF FNC! We'll be able to buy lots of yummy snacks with this!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hey! Hold off on the snacks for now. Gr Mk 23 prepared a delicious spread for dinner tonight!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Ticket...ticket... +Huh? Where's my ticket? I know I put it in this pocket, where could it have gone?
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Did you...lose your ticket?
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Oh no... I can't find it... +Ahhhh... I won't be able to get a red packet now... +Geez... And I made sure I put it in a safe place too... Sigh...
81typeR(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll who lost her ticket turns away and prepares to leave...
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Uh...hold on a minute! +It's okay if you've lost your ticket, I'll issue you another one!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Huh...? +But Type 81R, don't you usually...
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:The important thing is to be in good cheer when the New Year comes. +Besides, seeing you all come back safe and sound is more important than the ticket.
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:(Sniffs)... +Thank you so much, Big Sis 81!
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<震屏>:Big...what? +Where did that nickname come from?
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Ah, Type 97 started it, and it kinda caught on... +Does it bother you?
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Well, uh, it's fine... +Being in good cheer during Spring Festival...is what matters most, haha... +(Maybe I should have a chat with Type 95...)
()||<BIN>83</BIN><Night><黑点2>:After the ceremony, the other Dolls have all returned to base to begin the celebrations, while Type 81R remains outside to wrap things up.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:You worked really hard for this festival. +I can see your thoughtfulness in every aspect of the celebration.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:No, the event hasn't begun yet. +I'll be glad to see how happy everyone is after they get their red packets. +But I still need some time to think about what could've been done better...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Think about that after you've finished celebrating! +You told me before that this was a time to put down our daily burdens and spend some quality time with everyone. +Here, this is your red packet!
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Huh? Mine?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You prepared one for all of us; how could you not have one yourself?
81typeR(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 81R is slightly taken aback, but then she smiles.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||:Thank you, Commander. +I hope you enjoyed your journey. And of course, it would be great if you could fill out this feedback form!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd be happy to go on this ride a few more times. +But I'm not going anywhere during the Spring Festival... +So I suppose...this is already my stop.
81typeR(2)<Speaker>Type 81R</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:For the people returning home at this time, some of them live close by, while others have to travel a long, long way. +But no matter the distance, their hometowns won't be too far off once they board the train. +Hmm... Still, Dolls don't really consider the factories where they were manufactured home... +So I guess for us, our home is...wherever you are.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:And thus, the festival is kicked off with a good start. +However, my unease at seeing ART556's name on the list of preparation staff proved to be very justified. +After all, nobody had expected the festival fireworks and firecrackers to be ignited ahead of time.
