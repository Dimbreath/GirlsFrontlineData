()||<BIN>139</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The cocktail party is under way. The clinking of glasses and the guests' voices fill the air, and my sense of hearing is assailed by all kinds of noises.+Suddenly, the voice of someone calling to me reaches my ears.
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><震屏>:Commander!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:This voice...
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hehe, we meet again, Commander.
UMP9(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Standing before me, UMP9 seems somewhat different from my usual impression of her.+She's still got her playful and energetic smile, but she's not wearing her usual low-key dark gray jacket. Instead, she's in an evening dress that is elegantly tailored yet still manages to retain an air of youthful innocence.+In my eyes, nothing could suit her better.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Ah, UMP9. Did you finally remember to come say hi after so long?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Not quite... I was instructed to participate in a mission today, so I decided to see how you're doing while I'm here.+It looks like you've recovered quite well, Commander.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I've still got a few small issues here and there, but at least I don't need to be confined to an infirmary bed anymore.+As for you...where's the other one?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hehe, you knew I wasn't alone, Commander?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I'm just asking as my impression is that you two are always together.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I can't keep anything from you, can I?+Big sis is still making some final preparations, which means there's nothing for me to do, so I slipped out to wander around.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You are sure spontaneous.+Since all the necessary preparations have been made already, and you're saddled with overtime again on a day when we should've been celebrating our anniversary...+...Why don't you take this opportunity as a treat for yourself?
UMP9(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:UMP9 covers her smile as she hears my suggestion.+Now that she has received a reason to dig in, UMP9 assaults the tables of food and champagne like a tiger among goats, taking care to drag me along so she could share her appreciation for the food with me.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Ahh, this is tasty! This too!+Excuse me, another glass of champagne, please!
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Someone's really helping herself.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I'm only faithfully carrying out the instructions you gave me, Commander.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:You should still keep yourself in check. Don't ruin your pretty dress today.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Hehehe...does it suit me?+I've never been to a place like this before where there's delicious food and drinks as far as the eye can see, so I kind of got carried away.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Never? Didn't you attend last year's anniversary celebration?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Nope. I missed it because I was on a mission.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:That's certainly...
()||<BIN>139</BIN>:Beep.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏1>:Ah, hang on, hang on.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2>:Hello? Big sis, you're ready? Gotcha, I'll head over right now.+We're about to begin, so I'll be heading off now.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Right, it's just about time for the operation to start.+...Indulge yourself at next year's party to make up for the missed celebration.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点1>:Heehee, I was waiting for you to say that, Commander...
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Alarm</SE1><Night>:Some time later...+The ear-piercing alarm makes an enormous racket.+I glance down the chaotic venue hallway and realize that I just brushed by UMP9.+I turn around and call out to her.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Wait, UMP9!
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:What a coincidence, Commander!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Perfect timing. I have some things to ask you.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Alright, I'll gladly tell you anything I know.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:The jewel seems to have really vanished and nobody knows where it's gone.+Was it you, 9?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:And why do you think it was me, Commander?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Because you're capable of it.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Wow...you really think so highly of me, Commander?+Unfortunately, I don't have it.+But regardless of its whereabouts, the jewel will ultimately be taken to a safe place.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A safe place...+...Huh, I see now.
UMP9(6)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:After mulling over UMP9's words and the events of the party from earlier, a clear picture of the situation steadily develops in my mind.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I'll be leaving now if there's nothing else you'd like to ask.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:I have one more question for you.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Eh? Er...go ahead?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Did you have fun today?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:How should I say this...+I ate a lot of delicious food, I saw a lot interesting things, and I met a lot of fun people. +Today was an unforgettable day, and I'd like a fun day like today to never end.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Haha, I hope our next banquet will make up for any regrets you might still have today.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><Night>:Thank you, Commander.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><Night><黑点1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:UMP9 turns around and quickly runs out of sight.
()||<BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Several hours later.
UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:The mission is over, and the jewel has been returned to the client.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:As expected of you, big sis. You can handle anything with immaculate finesse.+It's a shame we couldn't keep that big jewel for ourselves.
UMP9(6);UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:Just following the plan was already much more troublesome than expected, to say nothing of taking it for ourselves. Clearing the records of all those electronic devices was a huge undertaking.+When you think about how complex the job was, the pay does seem quite meager in comparison. What do you think, 9?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:Me? What do I think?
UMP9(6)<Speaker></Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:UMP9 pauses for a bit then smiles.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:I think...it wasn't too bad.
UMP9(6);UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:...What do you mean?
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:Well, the party was more fun than I expected. There were food and drinks and lots of interesting things. Not to mention...+I even got a pretty new dress for free, and the Commander praised me and said I look good in them.+What about you, sis?
UMP9(6);UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:I'm content as long as you're happy.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>86</BIN><Night>:Isn't happiness the most precious thing?
UMP9(6);UMP45(4)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑屏1>:But it doesn't last.
UMP9(6)<Speaker></Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>9</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:A big, beaming smile spreads across UMP9's face.
UMP9(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(4)||<BIN>9</BIN><Night<黑屏1>>:That's why...+That's why it's so precious, right?
