指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:S.A.T.8? +Are you there, S.A.T.8? ART556?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Oh, it's the Commander! +Nope, that fuzzy monster isn't here.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She isn't here? +If I'm not mistaken, you and S.A.T.8 were assigned to make firecrackers, right? Why aren't the two of you together?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:S.A.T.8...gave me a list of ingredients to buy... +And after I bought them, she chased me away! +Honestly! I'm so bored now... What's the point in taking part in the preparations if I can't play with firecrackers?!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Is S.A.T.8 worried that ART556 would cause an accident around explosives, given her personality? It's quite understandable, to be honest...) +ART556, the preparations were never meant to be fun. +Many exciting events are only possible because people put in a lot of hard work behind the scenes.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<震屏>:I don't caaaare, I'm bored noooow! +Commander, do you have anything fun to do? Do you? You do, right?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I can't help you right now. Type 81R asked me to go check on the various teams. +I'll play with you later, okay? But before that, can you tell me where S.A.T.8 is?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:She said she'd be making the fireworks by herself this time, then she locked herself in the warehouse in the back and she hasn't come out since. +Be careful! She'll snap at anyone who gets close!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Mm, got it.
()||<BIN>4</BIN><黑点2>:After checking on S.A.T.8's situation, I meet ART556 again by the warehouse door.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:She chased you out too, didn't she? I just knew it! +You must agree that S.A.T.8 is nasty, right, Commander? She takes everything way too seriously and is so pig-headed!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's not like that, ART556. +The Spring Festival was a very meaningful occasion in the old days, and an East Asian T-Doll like Type 81R can't afford to treat it carelessly even in this modern age. +So while it's true that S.A.T.8 is being a little too serious about this, that's just how she shows that she's being responsible.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I don't understand such outdated logic! +Boredom is the most fearsome enemy of them all! What's the point in obeying all those rules if you can't live your life happily?!
()||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:On the afternoon of Spring Festival Eve, the door to the warehouse where S.A.T.8 is making the firecrackers and other pyrotechnics is slightly ajar...
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑点1>:Hahaha! I — found — it! +This is awesome! There are so many here!! +S.A.T.8 locked herself up in here for so long because she wanted to set all these off, right?!
()||<BIN>4</BIN><黑点2>:ART556 moves the various firecrackers and fireworks from the warehouse and dumps them into a pile on an open patch outside.
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Let me see... Ohhh...this ought to be in a bucket... +And this ought to explode here...which means I have to light it from...
ART556(2)<Speaker></Speaker>()||:As ART556 says so, she lights all the fuses...
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Hah! This is how it should be! +Let's see whether the fireworks S.A.T.8 made were a success!
()||:The first things to go off are the firecrackers...which are followed by the other shells exploding and throwing sparks everywhere... +Even the other firecrackers and fireworks - which she has not lit - are ignited in turn...
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ohhhh! What a sight! +This is amazing! Isn't this a great success?!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:And so, the fireworks which S.A.T.8 had been working so hard to put together for tonight go up in smoke.
()||<黑屏1>:Half an hour later... +After everyone has finally extinguished the tragic aftermath, I head to a corner and grab ART556, who is very intimidated by S.A.T.8's violent outburst.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2>:ART556, do you know what you did wrong?
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:I made S.A.T.8 mad... +Because...I ruined all the firecrackers and fireworks she made...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I told you before how much thought and effort S.A.T.8 put into them. +And in the end, you ruined them all just for fun. +I don't usually like to do this sort of thing, but your lack of restraint leaves me no choice but to put you into detention.
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<震屏>:Detention?! Noooo! +Commander! I'm sorry! +Please! I'll apologize to S.A.T.8! Please don't put me in detention!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But the fireworks we were supposed to set off tonight won't come back just because you apologize to S.A.T.8. +I think it's necessary so you remember the consequences of the trouble you caused.
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:(Sobs) Commander...please... +I...I'll find a way to get the fireworks back! I promise!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Tell me how, then. If you can't, it's detention for you. +Same thing goes if it involves hurting someone else.
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:I...uh...I... +I got it! Since, if it's firecrackers... +The most important thing about firecrackers is the loud noise they make, right? So if we can simulate that noise... +That's right! If we can simulate firecracker noises at the fireworks show, it'll be like getting the firecrackers back!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Instead of finding more firecrackers, we can reproduce their sound... I didn't think of that...) +(Sighhh... If only she would save all her bright ideas for useful things like this...)
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||<黑点1>:That should be okay, right, Commander? I'll go prepare the stuff right away! +Please, please don't put me in detention!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:If ART556 truly wants to make up for her mistakes, then the whole matter of simulating the sound of firecrackers will be her last chance. +From the reports of the people I have secretly sent to monitor her, she seems very serious for once...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>128</BIN><黑点2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:(Sighs) At long last, we've made it to the Reunion Dinner... +No more surprises now, just let me sit down and eat in peace...
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:C-Commander...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh, is that you, ART556? I heard those sound effects. +Still, even though we got through it this time, you still owe S.A.T.8 an apology. Got it?
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:I know... +Commander...this...uh... +This lunchbox...is for you...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? Where did you get this from?
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:It's a secret recipe from the kitchen... +And... I'm sorry for going overboard...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's fine as long as you know what you did wrong. Next time, think about how others feel before fooling around, got it?
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Okay...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then we'll leave things at this for now. +If you mess up again, I really will throw you in a detention cell right away.        
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Okay... Obrigada, Commander.
ART556(2)<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:ART556! What are you still doing here?! +MT-9 found a weird can in the back, and she says there's something moving inside it!        
ART556(2)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Huh?! How could MT-9 just leave me behind to play with fun stuff on her own?! +Where is she?! Take me there! We're going to open that can no matter what's inside!
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:ART556 happily runs off with the others to parts unknown.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hm...looks like she's not going to learn this lesson any time soon... +Is it because it didn't leave a lasting enough impression? +Ah, forget it. I won't press any further, considering what day it is today.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:At midnight.. +Although things had not gone as smoothly as planned, the sound of firecrackers and the fiery main event of pyrotechnics leave everyone with good memories, and serve as a perfect ending to this Spring Festival Eve celebration.
