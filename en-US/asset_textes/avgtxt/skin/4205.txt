MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:So you're saying we need to sell furniture to generate income?
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker><通讯框>;MG36(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, can I leave sales to you?</color>
JS9mm(2);MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:I believe I would be better off handling logistics. However...I make it a point to complete whatever assignment I receive. +So I'll do my best.

MG36(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Transmission terminated.</color>
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now then... I need to arrange these items in the display area. +Just putting them in doesn't pose much of a challenge.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:10 minutes later.
NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Look, the display over there are open! Shall we go take a look? Who knows, it might end up being as stunning as "Miss Ginkgo Leaf"!
NPC-PasserbyF(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:What's with this expo anyway, why are they letting people in while they're still setting up? +Well, let's go take a look.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Welcome.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:...
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Can I help you?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Uh... Why is the table on the bed?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:It is the dashboard for our voyage. When we awaken from our hibernation, it helps us get our bearings and swiftly take control of the situation.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker><Shake>||:A...dashboard?+Then where are the dials and displays?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:Inside your user manual.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:This booth is utterly ridiculous, why are all these perfectly good pieces of furniture scattered around like a junkyard sale... Ow! +What...what's this lantern doing on the floor?!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Are you talking about the smart trash can?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:Huh? Smart trash can? Is there even such a thing?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Yes, they glow dimly in the dark to ensure you don't misplace your garbage. +In addition, their cloud patterns ease the guilt you feel when wasting food.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:...What the hell is this wacky logic? It actually kind of makes sense, but who would make trash out out of paper-mâché?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Its replaceability is one of its selling points. You can discard anything you don't need inside it, be they bad feelings or disgusting food. +Then all you need to do is take hold of this...
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:That's the switch for the electric lantern... What are you going to do?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:(Clicks) +And just like that, the trash can engages its complete incineration protocols, burning everything you've thrown away into nothingness.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:Er...but if it burns everything away, doesn't that mean there's no way to retrieve the items inside?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:Yes, which is why you should think carefully before throwing trash away.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:That kind of makes sense... Are all pieces of replica furniture so well-made? +Wait a minute, this is just a lantern!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:It's a smart trash can.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:It can't be, you're just messing with your customers!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:All things exist for a reason.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:But where's the practicality? It's useless if you overstuff it and it breaks, right?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Nothing in this world is unbreakable, just as all life must someday end.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:That... Well, it sounds pretty profound, but aren't you just making excuses for its quality?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:This furniture is covered by a guarantee, as long as it's used correctly...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Gr MG36 continues stating her case to the customers, more and more people start to gather around.
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Apologies, everyone! This booth needs to be rearranged, so please take a look at our other booths in the meantime!
JS9mm(2)<Speaker>Passersby</Speaker>||:Aw, but I want to hear more...
JS9mm(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The people scatter in dejection.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...JS9. Why are you in such a hurry?
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Didn't you realize how many people were here? +Just squeezing in took me a lot of effort.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:Sorry about that. So what needs to be fixed?
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Do you really not know the functions of all this furniture?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:I found suitable uses for them.
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Yeah, I heard... Arghhhhhh, I don't even know where you went wrong! +Things are meant to be put to use, and you can technically use them however you want.  +But products are all manufactured to serve an initial purpose.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:Toothpaste doesn't actually sanitize human teeth, but it can be used for many other things.
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:That's an exception. +Look, how much force can this lantern take if you use it as a trash can?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:It would break easily, so maybe we should use this ceramic item instead? +Would it make a good trash can?
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:That's a flower vase.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:Can't it be used to hold other things?
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Its capacity is too small. It was made to hold flowers.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:Got it.
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Hm... Alright, let's lay it out like this. +What do you think?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;JS9mm(2)||:It definitely looks more orderly than just now...like something you'd see in everyday life.
MG36(0);JS9mm(2)<Speaker>JS9</Speaker>||:Good. +I gotta go, so do your best!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:See you later.
MG36()<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><黑点1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Furniture was made for use in everyday life, and I was made to be used. +So am I a piece of furniture too?
路过的孩子()<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点2>:Get it!
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Squeeeeak!
路过的孩子()<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:(Pants) Don't let it get away! That's one fat rat!
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Squeak—!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Squeak squeak...beep beep...The square root of 10 is 3.162277660168379... The natural logarithm of 10 is 0.434294481903252... No, I mean, in base 10, the logarithm of e is...
MG36(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Squeak?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:...A hamster.
MG36(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG36 looks down and a hamster looks back up at her. As she bends down, the hamster immediately breaks into a sprint...
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, we're not open... +Ah, looks like it's fainted.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Uh, excuse me, miss!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Hello, can I help you?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Did you see a big rat just now?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:A big rat?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Yeah, it was super fat! +I wonder how many rockets I'd need to send it into the sky. We were just about to find out when it ran off from the launch platform!！
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:I haven't seen any rats that are "super fat" around. +Why are you conducting these experiments?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Just for fun.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:There you are... I've been searching for you all day, Mom and Dad are worried.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Oh, big sis!
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:Let's go. Dad says his legs are killing him.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passing Child</Speaker>||:Ah well... It can't be helped, then. Let's go!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Have a good trip.
MG36(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:After sending away the customers, Gr MG36 moves her foot aside. The hamster that passed out just now is trembling as it hugs her heel.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:There there, you're not fat or anything.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Hamster</Speaker>||:Squeak...
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:Oh, it's opened again! +How much is this lantern?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:...We have customers. Take these cookies and wait here until I come back.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Hamster</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Squeak?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Welcome, would you like this lantern? Is there anything else you'd like?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:Weren't you calling it a smart trash can?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Lanterns and trash cans are just names. +No matter what you call it, it won't keep you from using it as you see fit.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:You've got a silver tongue on you. I'm actually more interested in you than the furniture.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Sorry, but I'm not for sale. Would you like anything else besides the lantern?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:That'll do. Oh, and that "dashboard" from just now. +What is this "dashboard" called now?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:It is the Eight Immortals Virtual Dashboard Table.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:And what does a virtual dashboard have to do with an Eight Immortals Table?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:When people are unable to control their destiny, they imagine beings who can influence the way things unfold and call them gods. +When the table is unable to control its own fate, we then become its gods.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:But why Eight Immortals?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Seven people have stopped by to ask its price. You are the eighth, which means this virtual dashboard now belongs to you.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:Haha, I like you. I'll take these two items, then.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Thank you for shopping with us.
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:Won't you consider changing jobs? With your gift of the gab, you could do well in sales.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:...If I had a chance to change jobs, I would. +Please support the movie that I may or may not film one day.
MG36(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:After sending off the first customer, people start pouring nonstop into the booth. The furniture is soon sold out. +Gr MG36 sees that her work is almost done and bends down to check on the hamster.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
MG36(0)<Speaker>Hamster</Speaker>||:Squeak!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Wonderful, you seem to have recovered. +Now be good and stay here. Once I'm done, I'll play with...
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:Ah, I almost forgot I was supposed to buy something... And you're still here!
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:Indeed I am. May I know what you would like?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:How much is this vase? I want it.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:Alright, anything else?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:Those paper window shades look good, I'm taking them too.
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||:Very well. +Is that all?
MG36(0);NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Passerby</Speaker>||:Yes, thank you. Oh right, my little brother asked me to pass on a message. +"You're really pretty, miss."
MG36(0)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyF(0)||<黑屏1>:Thank you.

MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:That's right, the only ones here are myself and HAL 9002.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:HAL 9002...
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Yes, Hal for short. +Here he is.
MG36(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG36 holds up a hamster.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Er... That's a nice name.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:He is a talented performer, and I think he could act beside me in the movie I'm preparing for. We would shine on the silver screen.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you planning to shoot a movie?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:It was just an idea... About a dream that humanity had a long time ago, and the re-emergence of that dream a long time after. +If I simply carry out my orders, then I am no different from a lantern.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Lantern? You mean like the one printed on the poster behind you?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:No, that's a smart trash can.
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Huh?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:Do you have more work for me?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Not going to explain yourself?
MG36(2)<Speaker>Gr MG36</Speaker>||:I never reveal spoilers to the audience, especially when the outline isn't finished yet. +All in all... Please look forward to it.
MG36(2)<Speaker>HAL 9002</Speaker>||:Squeak!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What kind of idea has this expo given Gr MG36, and what kind of movie is she going to make? +As a prospective member of her audience, I have no idea. +However, it'll probably be a good one. +With that thought in mind, I move on to the next display booth.
