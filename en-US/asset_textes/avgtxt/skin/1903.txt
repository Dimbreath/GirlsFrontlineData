()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>138</BIN>:...+After verifying the security measures of the Dolls standing by in the reception hall, I make my way back to the studio room.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Although this is the only company that has allowed us to bring weapons and live ammo into their building...+Forget it, allowing everyone to experience the romance (or lack thereof) of humans taking wedding photos is also a good thing.+Come to think of it...I wonder if I'll ever have my turn in front of the flashbulb...
<Speaker></Speaker>()||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><BIN>138</BIN>:Just then, I notice Gr MP5 sitting by herself in a corner of the studio.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Are you done with your photos already, Gr MP5?
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Commander...+I haven't taken my pictures yet...+The photographer said I should sort myself out first.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:(Didn't they start a while ago?)+Is there a problem? Is someone bullying you?
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Huh...? Ah...the photographer and the other staff members are all very nice to me. Nothing's wrong!+Actually...I think I'm the cause of the problem here...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:So were YOU bullying the staff members, then?
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Of course not! Of course not!
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Good, I'm glad to see that you're still full of energy. I was actually a little worried when I saw you looking so sad.+So what's troubling you? I rarely get to see you wear such beautiful clothes; they don't go well with a frown.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:I...uh...it's nothing terribly important...+It's just that after I came here, I realized wedding dresses are...better suited for taller girls.+Someone like me simply can't do a big fancy skirt justice.+So...I kind of envy the others...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:(Hm...so it's because of her height...)+Fancy as it may be...there's fewer people who can wear a big skirt than you might think.+There was even someone just now who had to stand on a box under her dress to make herself look taller for her photos. That's what I call tiring.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:But that should be normal, given that we're wearing wedding dresses...+If only I were a little taller, then I wouldn't look like a flower girl in the pictures...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Flower girls are cute too... Er...I mean...ahem...+The original plan was to give everyone a chance to experience wearing something different for a change. Since such opportunities are hard to come by, why not go for some variety?+The dress they picked out for you is much better than I expected, and I think it suits you really well.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:No it doesn't... If only human wedding dresses are red and black...+Then even a childish design wouldn't look so weird...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Er...a red and black dress might give off the impression that the bride will tear the groom into pieces during the shoot...+It's probably best to be cheerful at a wedding. Everyone looks so stern when taking their photos, it's actually kind of scary.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:I think everyone looks so serious only because they're wearing big skirts...+If only my pictures could turn out like theirs.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:You don't need to copy others when it comes to style.+A natural look makes for the best photos, which is why I said your outfit suits you very well.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Boo...+In the end, you're still not denying that I look like a flower girl, Commander!
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:You can be a cheerful, energetic little maid of honor for this photo shoot.+Once you grow taller someday and you really do wear a big skirt, you'll miss a lissome style like this.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Someday when I grow taller...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:It's not that far off, trust me.+You should smile. It's a rare opportunity for you to be dressed so beautiful.
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Okay! Got it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Despite answering vivaciously, she falls silent again.+She then questions...
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:But what if...I stay this short forever... What do I do then?
MP5(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN>:Well...+Keep...drinking more milk and see if it helps? 
MP5(4)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>138</BIN><震屏><黑屏1>:See if it helps?!
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:After our conversation, Gr MP5 successfully completes the photo session with a casual and energetic attitude.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:Later that evening, everyone gathers around to look at each others' sample pictures.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh? You look quite charming with that pose, SV-98. But not as charming as my pictures, of course.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:These photographers...they're amazing...+Is that really me in the photos?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I'm so hungry... We can go eat after we're done here, right?+Let's hurry up!
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;56-1type(0)||<BIN>80</BIN>:The pictures we're selecting will be shown to the public as part of a joint advertising campaign. We can't be careless.+I've got some biscuits here. If you don't mind it, you can have them to deal with your hunger for now.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Uwah...+Although I want to eat all the biscuits...+There won't be anything left for the others if they get hungry too... I guess I'll have to bear with it.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Don't worry, we're almost done.+I have to say, out of all the photos today, Gr MP5's surprise me the most.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Eh?! Me?
MP5(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Oh yes. Your style looks completely different from everyone else.+You really stood out during the group shot.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Just as I thought...+I was worried that my photos would be too different...
MP5(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That's not a bad thing. Frankly speaking, I'm kind of envious that you could present yourself like that.+Tch, it looks like my ideas were constrained by the notion that one had to stand up straight in the photograph.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Eh? That's...
MP5(0);56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Your outfit is really suited for this style of photography, Gr MP5...+I only dared to face the camera straight on because my dress left my back completely exposed...
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Aw...don't be like that!+I couldn't wear the long dresses like you guys did because I'm still far too short.+Once I grow taller, I will take a more mature and beautiful set of photos for sure!
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Hehe... Gr MP5, wedding photos are a once-in-a-lifetime deal for humans, you know.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Although it's quite common now for it to happen more than once... Ack.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Keep it to yourself, Miss Type56-1.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Still, it is a very idealized thing.+Having us take them just feels a little...
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:......+An idealization, huh...+To some extent, Dolls are the same, too.+Standing to the side, I watch as the girls finish picking out their photos, and we then prepare to return to the base.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:In truth, I have my doubts about whether if Gr MP5 would actually grow taller over time.+However, being able to leave such a touching memory in their neural clouds today was worth all the toil and effort.+They must feel the same way, given the smiles on their faces...+Because an idealized creation contains the essence of truth to begin with.
