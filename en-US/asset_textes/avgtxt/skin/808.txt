()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...A day before the anniversary banquet.
()||<BIN>8</BIN>:At the Griffin base.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1>:Time to check on the preparations for the anniversary banquet.+Although this wasn't my responsibility in the first place...
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>2.5</黑屏2><边框>2</边框>:Ahh! I'm totally swamped!+Besides managing the daily supplies, I also have to prepare the things for the party...+And we have to take care of the preparations for the banquet as well! Miss Helian is expecting too much from us!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Commander, could you do me a favor and head over to the banquet hall?
NPC-Kalin(6)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>2.5</黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:I'm really too busy to do it myself...
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>2.5</黑屏2>:Although I did agree to help, but...
()||<BIN>8</BIN>:I look at the two large boxes placed next to the wall. Inside are decorations with the company's logo that need to be properly arranged in the banquet hall tonight.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:Looks like I'll have to get a helper after all.+Now then, the T-Doll with the most time to spare is...
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:A few minutes later.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:Were you looking for me, Commander?
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Yep, I need you to do something with me. +We need to bring these two boxes to the venue of tomorrow's banquet.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Doing some heavy-lifting then? Sure.
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:M950A readily agrees and walks toward the two large boxes.+She grabs the handles on the boxes and easily picks them up.
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(She seems unexpectedly enthusiastic...)
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:What is it, Commander? +Aren't we going?
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:...Ah, yes.+Let's go.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:...One hour later.
()||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点2>:At the hotel.+I finish my discussion with the hotel manager and return to the banquet hall.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Sorry to keep you waiting, 950. +Um... Where's the stuff that we brought over?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I've already handed them over to the staff. They said that they'll start decorating in a short while.
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Oh?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Is something the matter?
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:No...it's nothing. It's just that I didn't expect you to be so ethusiastic about this.+It should be your first time coming here, right? Want to check the place out?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:No need. I've already explored the place while you were away.+Besides, I'll be here again tomorrow.
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Oh, that's right, I forgot that your name is on the guest list for the banquet.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:By the way, Commander...
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:M950A hesitates for a bit. I follow her line of sight and see a small stage on one side of the hall. She seems to be particularly fixated on the microphone in the middle of the stage.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Can I ask you a question?
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:What is it?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Was a band hired for tomorrow's banquet?
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:There should be.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I see... Perhaps the banquet tomorrow will be more interesting than I thought.
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Are you interested in the band?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:I suppose you could say that.+If there's gonna a band, then perhaps...
M950A(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:Perhaps?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN>:...Nevermind.+Let's go, Commander.
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>139</BIN><黑点1>:Alright.+ (M950A seems to be hiding something... I'll find a chance to ask her about it tomorrow.)
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The next day.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:During the anniversary banquet.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏1>:Phew... Even I'm feeling a bit tired at such an occasion.+Let me find a quiet spot to take a rest...
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>:As I make my way across the banquet hall, I see the small stage from yesterday. +Right now, the indoor band is performing a soothing melody that complements the banquet's atmosphere.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏1>:Come to think of it...I haven't seen M950A since the banquet started. +Let me go look for her.
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑屏2>:...Ten minutes later.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>79</BIN>:Looks like she's not in the banquet hall. +Hmm, she seemed very interested in that microphone yesterday...
()||<BIN>79</BIN><黑点1>:I leave the banquet hall after asking a staff member a few questions.
()||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In the hotel's storage room.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Socket... Socket...+I don't see any here... How about...
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:M950A, what're you doing here?
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><震屏>:Ah! Commander... Why are you here?!
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:To look for you, of course. +...What are you doing with that microphone?
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Err...I-I-I'm...+I'm looking for a power socket!
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Huh? 
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:I wanted to try the microphone here...
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:What for?
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:The banquet was a bit boring, so I wanted to pass some time here...+I'll return before the banquet ends!
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:That's no good, you can't use the facilities in the hotel without permission.+Not to mention, the banquet is still going on...so you can't make any weird noises.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:We're pretty far away from the main hall, so it should be fine, right?
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:That's not the problem here, 950...+This is a very important event for the company, so let's do our best ensure its success, okay? +Besides, I'm sure you know that not every T-Doll had the opportunity to be invited.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...I understand, Commander.+I'm sorry. It's just that the banquet isn't what I expected it to be, so I...don't know what I could do there.
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Did you want to...sing on that stage?
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Yeah... I'm actually not very good at socializing...+To me, it's easier to get people's attention by singing. +I originally thought that I would have a chance to sing here, but I guess not...+But then again...a T-Doll wouldn't be allowed to sing at a banquet like this in the first place anyway.
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Is that so...+Your wish might come true later tonight, though.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Huh?
M950A(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:There will be a special party after the banquet ends. +You can do whatever you want to your heart's content there tonight.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏1>:Alright...+Looks like I can't miss the party tonight.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:After that, I return to the banquet hall with M950A.
()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2>:...+The night of the anniversary celebration.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:The party is coming to an end, and the booming café is starting to quiet down.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...It's time.
M950A(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:M950A rises from her seat in the corner. +She steps across several T-Dolls snoring on the floor and heads straight towards the stage that was set up just for her. At least she herself thinks so.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:...Okay, no problems with the microphone and the speakers.
M950A(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:M950A fiddles with the music player and the soothing melody is replaced by a dynamic rhythm.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Everyone! +This night of yours, are you calling it quits already?!
M950A(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:The T-Dolls turn their heads to look at M950A.+Welcoming the gazes of the crowd, she lifts her head with confidence and grabs onto the microphone in front of her.
M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Listen to my song!
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:M950A begins to sing. +Some drunken T-Dolls are awakened by her passionate singing.
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Ugh...hit me...hit me with another one! 416!
M1891(2);HK416(4)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Heh...you think I...I'd lose to you? +No matter the circumstances...I'll always...be the best!
M1891(2)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>;HK416(4)||<BIN>80</BIN>:Then let's continue...
HK416(4)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:I...I'm game...+Where's the booze? Get me some booze!
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><震屏>:...You guys! Drink all you want, but don't start flipping tables!
WA2000(8);M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:That's right, just like this...+Enjoy this wondrous night with my singing!
WA2000(8)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;M950A(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:This is too much!+Argh... You're being too loud!+Someone stop them!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>;M950A(2)||<BIN>80</BIN>:That looks like fun! I want to sing too!+M950A! Let me sing too!
VZ61(2);M950A(2)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:This is MY stage, I'm not giving it away that easily!
VZ61(2)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:So stingy... Then, I'll just have to take it by force!
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:In the midst of M950A's singing, the waning party came back to life.
M1903(6)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Should we stop them, Commander?
M1903(6)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN>:Let them enjoy themselves tonight...as long as they don't cause too much damage.
()||<BIN>80</BIN>:I look towards M950A. She is fighting for the microphone with several other T-Dolls while singing a song that belongs just to her.
Commander()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏1>:Besides...+It's pretty nice to appreciate the magic brought about through singing from time to time, don't you think?
