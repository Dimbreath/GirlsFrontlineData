AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker><通讯框>||:Psst...M4? You still there?
AAT52(0);M4A1(0)<通讯框><Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Any discovery, AAT?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:I'm currently in the Highland Archive and detecting Executioner's transmission signal. +Executioner should still be miles away in the command post, which means her transmission device is right here!
AAT52(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Understood. Can you pinpoint its precise location?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:I'm feeling my way forward...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Poof!
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Whoa!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What is it, AAT?!
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The lights... +The lights in the archive have all suddenly gone out!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Don't panic. Assess the situation first. +Do you have a flashlight or night vision goggles with you?
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:I do, but neither is working...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Could this be an enemy electromagnetic attack...? +Any sign of Sangvis movement?
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Uhh...nothing seems out of the ordinary... +But there are way too many of them. I'm kinda stuck. +There's no way I can find the device this way. Anyone wanna give me a hand?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's too dangerous to continue the search. This could very well be what the enemy is waiting for. +AAT, you are advised to retreat.
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:That'll be too much of a challenge in the dark... +Ughh... Am I gonna die in such a cold, dark place...?
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker><通讯框>||:Does AAT need help? +I'm pretty close. Why don't I give it a try?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><通讯框>||:No, let me do it. I specialize in disarming explosives.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Do you think this is a good idea, M99?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hmm...we are running low on both time and manpower. I think we should take a more proactive approach. +Besides, opportunities of putting Executioner out of action are hard to come by...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:There will be other opportunities. It doesn't have to be now. +If we alert her to our presence...
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><通讯框>||:It'll be fine. She's still on patrol, and I doubt she'll be quicker than me.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:(That's right. Even if Executioner starts moving, I can intercept her, so she can't make it to the highlands right away.) +(Also, Hunter and Executioner both seem to be deprived of their own consciousness, so they shouldn't notice the infiltration too soon...) +(However...have I really taken everything into consideration?)
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Hey, how long are you gonna keep deliberating? Come get me!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +(Does it all come down to my decision again...?) +(I suppose I should have faith in their ability...) +Super SASS, you go rescue AAT-52.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker><通讯框>||:Roger that! +AAT-52, I'll be there soon!
()||:...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Will this do?) +(Perhaps making some decision is better than making none at all...) +I just...have to think about it this way, right...?
