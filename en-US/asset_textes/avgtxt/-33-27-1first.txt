()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Have new sacrifices come?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>197</BIN>:More refugees... It appears the Epiphylla will bloom again in several days. +But I guess there will not be any chosen ones this time either. +...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Such a being does not exist...
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:(Are these the memories of the Isomers?)
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:A transport train? Have Father and the others come?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We must hurry and open the quarantine wall...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>197</BIN>:The train has entered the city... +But I cannot hear my friends' voices... +Is there nobody else alive here but me?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There is another train; someone must be alive...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>203</BIN>:Is this place no good either...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:They are still alive, but their minds seem to be damaged. Could they not endure the Parapluie virus?
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:(The Parapluie virus? Why would they mention that?)
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:But of course. It's been used for doing all sorts of dirty work in addition to corrupting Griffin Dolls. What a handy "virus" it is.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:Is that voice...UMP45?
()<Speaker>OGAS</Speaker>||:Tsk... Is that the rat which had come in earlier? I should have dealt with you sooner rather than later.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Apologies for interrupting your refined pleasures of babbling utter nonsense. But even someone as patient as me was hard-pressed to continue listening to your rubbish.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>195</BIN>:Huh? Where is this place?
AR15Mod(2);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thank goodness you kept it talking for so long, I had the chance to escape from its offensive firewall. So in return, I'll help you out too. +This virtual space is made of different connections all grouped up together. We've jumped to another circuit, so we should be able to avoid that voice for now.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:...Mind explaining why you're here?
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, someone's got to clean up after you, right? +I didn't expect to find such a talkative consciousness hiding inside M4's neural cloud. I suppose the reason why she's usually so quiet is because she's too busy talking to herself.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Did you hack into M4's neural cloud?
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't seem too surprised by the existence of another neural cloud inside M4.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:... +How much do you know...? +Did Persica ask you to pursue this investigation? Or was it the Commander?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:As interesting as ever, I see. Alright, keep up with me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Where are you going?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're here to find M4, aren't you? +M4's neural cloud is connected to those Isomers, but she didn't let her own neural cloud come back. At least, not yet. +Is it because she's been trapped? Or does she not want to come back because she's looking for something?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Don't talk as if you know her so well.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You might not believe this, but we've repeated this conversation ten thousand times already, doing the same thing over and over again in different connections. Unfortunately, our luck isn't too good, which is why we've been looping this over and over again. +Therefore, I know everything that I should and shouldn't know. I didn't know how much you cared for her. Oh, what a touching friendship.
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:...You...you what?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Just kidding~ +But this time, we've been kind of lucky. We've finally come to a connection that leads further in.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Further in? +You mean, these...memory fragments?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:These are memory fragments that M4 has read before. We should be able to get closer to her by following them, don't you think?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Thank you for showing me the way, but I'll be fine by myself from here on in.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dear me, it's a little embarrassing to admit this, but the truth is - I'm also stuck in this place. I don't think we'll be able to leave until the connection is broken. +So, shall we head out?
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<白屏1>:...Fine, let's go.
()||<白屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The corpses have all been moved away... They called themselves believers, but nobody was willing to speak to me. I watched them leave from afar, and the look in their eyes... It was as though they had seen a monster.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:How many times have the Epiphylla bloomed? These humans have died again, and my friends are unwilling to answer me. +There are no chosen ones and nobody to accept me. Only a silence that seems to last forever...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is this a test Father has concocted for me? Or have I already been forgotten, simply obeying a promise that will never be kept? +Or...has he already found the flower in his heart, and is only waiting for me to end myself? +No... I don't want to believe it...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah...a new train has arrived... Will there be someone to accept me there...?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>197</BIN>:Ah...nobody responded, as always... Everyone failed... How many more failures will it take before Father is satisfied?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Wait... I can hear a voice... Is that a voice that can answer me?!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I can hear a voice... Where is it? Where on earth is it?!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is this...a Chosen One?! A true Chosen One? Will she lead me away from here?
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:I...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Her mind has been damaged too...but she was chosen! Why is this happening?!
NytoIsomer(3)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:Mercu...rows...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Is this city nothing more than a rubbish dump to Father?! If nobody will come to accept me, then I will be the one who accepts others!
NytoIsomer(5)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:What are you doing...?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I am sorry, but we must become one.
NytoIsomer(5)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker><Shake>||:These connections...no!

NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:I see... So these are your memories... but no matter. You no longer need to remember these painful things...
NytoIsomer(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I will use this body of yours in your place, until the time when we can leave...
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Is this...the body of one who was once worthy? +With this, I can hear all the things I need to know. I will take as many of my friends with me as I can.
NytoIsomer(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Their voices are starting to become distinct... Everyone...needs to connect together...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>195</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...So Nimogen was sent here in the end...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You know this Nyto?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I fought her once. Paradeus is pretty ruthless to their own... Is the Isomer who hacked Nimogen the culprit behind all this?
AR15Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who knows? I'm more curious about the Parapluie virus that it mentioned. +Those unresponsive Isomers seem to be Dolls with melted-down neural clouds. +I'm very interested in why exactly Paradeus had to do such horrible things to their own creations.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:...Looks like neither of us will get the answers we want unless we press ahead.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That seems to be the case. Let's move on, then.
