()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:...Gager has already located 98k's hiding spot.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:What, no more tricks up your sleeve?
98k(1)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Tsk, her self-repair speed is much faster than mine.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Nein...I can't move... I've taken too much damage.</color>
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I was going to let you die with some dignity, but the only fate a shameless Doll like you deserves is to be dismantled piece by piece!
()||:Gager stalks closer and closer towards Kar98k, who's leaning against a tree.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;98k(1)||<黑屏1>:Gager grabs her by the neck and lifts her off the ground. +98k knows that the Sangvis ringleader is about to hack her neural cloud.

MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BIN>2</BIN><Night><黑点2>:Hold on, I can give you what you want!
98k(1)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Humph, you're the clown that popped out of nowhere. +You Griffin Dolls have a thing for dying whilst huddling together like the pathetic weaklings that you are.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Don't you want to find out Architect's whereabouts?! +I know exactly where she is! I'm a recon Doll at Griffin – I possess a lot more information than a combat Doll like her!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager studies MP41 with more deliberation.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Then...where is she? +No...you think I'd believe you liars?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Architect was captured during a winter operation! +After being sent to IOP for studies and research, she was transported back to a Griffin base and monitored in a lab... +And I have the coordinates of the base!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>—!</color>
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Well, don't you want to know?! +All the information is right here in my neural cloud. You just have to set up a link with me... +And you can find out everything you want to know! +But in return, you must release Fräulein Kar and let the rest of us go free!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You think a low-spec Doll like you has any right to negotiate with me?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:You don't dare negotiate with me? +Did that teensy little injury you took from this low-spec Doll scare you too much from even setting up a connection?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Humph...
()||:Gager drops 98k.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The next instant, she's in front of MP41...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Grabbing her by the neck. 
BOSS-7(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:You're quick... I expect nothing less from a Sangvis ringleader... +<color=#A9A9A9>Whoa...! So this is how it feels to be hacked... It's awful...</color>
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:You have some gall to stand in my way with your pitiful performance, trash.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:I will obtain the information I'm after, then I'll kill you all—

BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Trash...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Your neural cloud...doesn't actually contain any information about Architect...!
BOSS-7(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Humph...DUH! You know full well I'm just a low-spec Doll! +That's right, how would a lowly low-spec Doll have such strictly confidential information?!
BOSS-7(0);MP41(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:MP41 grabs hold of the arm with which Gager is choking her and flashes a victorious grin.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:What are you doing...? +Let go, trash!
BOSS-7(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:If I hadn't said that, you wouldn't have come close to me... +And if you hadn't come so close, I wouldn't be able to blow you sky-high! 
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:You strapped explosives onto yourself?!
BOSS-7(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:I was right to save half of the explosives. No matter how hard your armor is...it won't come out unscathed when caught right next to an explosion!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You bastard!
98k(1)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:MP41!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Fräulein Kar, bear witness to this moment! +I told you I would help you destroy this Sangvis ringleader! +I've finally done it... +...Heheh, now I'm finally gonna get some recognition, aren't I?
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><白屏1>:BOOM!
()||<白屏2>:MP41 detonates the explosives on herself...
98k(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tremendous explosion forces Kar98k to shield her eyes with her remaining arm.
