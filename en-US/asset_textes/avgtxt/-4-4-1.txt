UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Right. Are the preparations done, RO?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you sure about this, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I've given you both our maps and my suggestion. The rest depends on how much you trust me.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Okay.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Listen. Squad 404 will infiltrate the Sangvis base and shut down the main power supply of the cannons.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:The same old trick? Architect will be prepared for that.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I realized something before. +Her authorization doesn't allow her to guard all the power sources at the same time.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That will only buy us some time, but it'll be enough for us to move out.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:On top of the power supply, we'll also sabotage their comms channel. +That will mess up their coordination and buy us even more time.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's it. Meanwhile, M1887 will lead the other T-Dolls to draw Gager's attention. 
M1887(0)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker><通讯框>||:So we'll be facing two Ringleaders simultaneously?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Indeed. I'm afraid you'll have to backup your neural clouds beforehand. +Don't worry. You will have my full attention before Squad 404 complete their objective.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But that's forcing it quite a bit...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:This is our only chance. +The AR Team will raid the the base, hack into its control system and open the gateway leading to the outside. +Then all hands make for the gateway and be ready to welcome the rescue party at the heliport. Understood?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:RO... +You're the only one we can count on. I hope you understand that.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I remember what you said. +Please trust me, everyone, and let's go home together.
M1887(0)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'll obey all orders issued by the one in command, as that is the first order all T-Dolls are given.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Very well. Any more objections? +Then let's prepare for our final stand, RO.
