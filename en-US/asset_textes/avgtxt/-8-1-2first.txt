FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sobs) I...I thought I was gonna die for sure!
FN49(0);FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:What's there to be scared of, seriously? +Though that crazy lightning did make me jump out of my skin...
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FNFNC(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Alright, alright. As long as everyone is okay...+So, have they figured out what that massive lightning strike was?
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Helian asked questions but didn't get much of an answer... Architect seemed pretty shocked too. +If the one in charge of running tests on Sangvis weaponry doesn't have a clue, then it probably has nothing to do with S.F. +Now, the only mystery is... (glances at the blonde girl) +FF FNC, how did you find her?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I didn't see her while I was scouting... +But after the lightning strike, she's just there, lying in the rubble.
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:The way she appeared was so bizarre... D-Do you think she's human? Look at her strange clothes...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Her physical features do suggest she's human, but there's nothing that sheds light on her identity. +Still, she most likely has something to do with the lightning strike...
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Blonde girl</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hmm... Ugh...
BB_Noel(2);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Whoa! S-She's awake!
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Blonde girl</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:What a racket... Huh? W-Where am I?
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You speak our language? Wonderful... +Please state your identity and objective.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Blonde girl</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:H-Huh? Me? +Argh! My head hurts! What in the world...? +Oh right! I remember falling into a Cauldron, then...
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sighs) Apologies, but please get to the point.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah, I'm sorry! My name is Noel Vermillion! Say, you guys... +This place looks almost like Kokonoe's lab... Are you from Sector Seven?
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Sector Seven? What's that?
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Uh, sorry. I'm not asking my questions in order. I did pass through a Cauldron, after all... +May I ask, what year is this?
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...2062. This is Griffin Control in Area S09.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:... +...WHAT?! +The Gregorian calendar?! 100 years ago... Have I traveled this far?! +Area S09... I've never heard of this place before... +Griffin... What on earth...?
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:…Did you guys pick up a psychiatric patient? (Gestures at her head)
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I-I don't know... Should I call the hospital?
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Voilà! Already on it.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:W-Wait! I'm not a weirdo! +I know it's hard to believe, but please listen to me... +I'm a traveler from the future.
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:... +Sigh...I know. You won't believe me...
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hold on. Do you know what the lightning strike just now was?
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Lightning strike?
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:A massive lightning struck the spot where you appeared. We found you after that.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lightning strike... Don't tell me...! +I think a ray of light flashed past me while I was passing through the Cauldron. I Then I lost consciousness... +Maybe that's what caused a distortion in space and brought me to this strange place...
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:What to do, FAL? Should we believe in such nonsensical raving?
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Take her into custody for now. Report her name and do some investigation.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Th-that won't do! I can't stay here! I have to go back!
BB_Noel(2);FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Aren't you a traveler? Can't you just "whoosh!" if you want to go back?
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FNFNC(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I can't go back without an Observer!
BB_Noel(2);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Observer? Another new archetype...?
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:The one who "observes" me... That's right! +She must be here as well! I saw her in the Cauldron! +She suddenly appeared before me together with that lightning strike... +She has long ears...more like bunny ears.
BB_Noel(2);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:One of our T-Dolls DID wear something like that a few months ago.
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Sorry, we didn't find any bunny girl at the scene.
BB_Noel(2);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:It's enough of a shock finding a weirdo like you.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:How...could that be...
BB_Noel(2);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Bien. Follow me, s'il vous plaît? Your room is ready.

BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Curiouser...and curiouser. +I never expected the "spirit" that emerges from there to be this powerful. +I thought we were already at the climax.
