Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Alright. They're your new teammates.+Well? Aren't they all lovely?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Indeed...+It is my honor to serve with such beautiful people...
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：No, they're like you. They're also T-Dolls.+Hmm... We still need to install...a weapon wielding software in your Imprint, don't we?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：What? Weapon...?
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Since it's just a test for the AI... Let's go with the most generic one.

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>22</BIN><黑屏2>：There. Here we go. Assault Rifle M4A1.+This should be...the most commonly used weapon. With the corresponding software installed, you'll be able to wield it like your own arm.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：M4...A1?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：That's right. From now on, the M4A1 is your bespoke weapon.+By the by, it is one of Kryuger's weird quirks that T-Dolls should be named after their weapons...+So your name is now M4A1.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：My name is...M4A1...?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Hmm... What weapons should the other T-Dolls use...?+It'll be confusing if you're all armed with the M4A1...+Guess I'll give them your sister variants. After all, you're now practically sisters.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Sisters...?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Hmm... It might be a bit hard...for you to grasp this concept at this stage.+But don't sweat it. Okay, M4, look at this.+M16A1, M4 SOPMOD II, and AR-15.+With that, all matches have been made. Be sure to get along from now on.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Why...should we get along?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Uh...I told you. You're sisters!+One should get along with their family.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Family...?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Yeah, "family". Do you feel warm and fuzzy hearing this word?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Family... My family...+No, I have no family...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Huh?+But look, M4A1, their weapons look very similar to yours, don't they?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Weapons...?+No...weapons... No...
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>：Uh...what do you mean "no"? They're in the same series. There's no way I could've been mistaken.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：But why are their weapons...+Their weapons...+...Why are they all stained with blood?
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：...?!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Blood... Why...are they...all drenched in blood?+Miss Persica... Why... Why...
()||：M4A1 keeps repeating the same question.
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Dammit...+Is her neural cloud having a meltdown again...at the sight of weapons?!+Sorry, M4. You'll have to go back to sleep...

Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：What other memory fragments...remain sealed...?+M16, please hurry up...
