BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||:Damn it! They escaped… Those monsters suddenly acted as if they were going to commit a suicide attack!+All units cease fire!  Return to the base and await for further orders!+I'll let you go this time, but the next time won't be so easy!
()||:……
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:…With the help of the Commander, we broke through the Sangvis blockade.+We arrived at the human settlement two hours later and handed off the goods to the person in charge.+Of course, the recipient did not raise any objections to my "excuse" for the loss of goods.+It is an era of chaos after all, and those supplies are nothing to those who are relatively abundant.+However, we couldn't escape Miss Helian's keen eye for detail...
()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2>:…Griffin HQ.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:M99, what's going on here?+I checked the list of goods and there seems to be a small difference between when you received it and when you delivered it.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Umm… I explained it to the person in charge there…
M99(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:According to your report, this difference was lost in battle.+Yet, the packaging of the supplies in the photos seems to be in pristine condition...+I'm sure these supplies were well protected in battle, so I don't think one box would inexplicably go missing...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:That's… That's because…
M99(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Lying is meaningless, you know.+I don't want to look through your neural cloud for this trivial matter…
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+(Although this is a trivial matter, a T-Doll such as myself still do not have the authority to lie to a superior...)+(Since we've come to this point… Sorry, everyone…)
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I'm sorry, Miss Helian...+At that time, we weren't able to find a safe resupply point with enough resources, and it would've been very difficult for us to complete the mission on low supplies.+That's why...+I——
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Beep.+…Helian receives a call.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:…Excuse me for a moment.
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:(Quiet voice) …ordered everyone to take from the cargo…
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Hello? …Go ahead...+Oh…is that so...+…I see, so it was a misunderstanding.+…That's alright, you don't need to apologize......No, she didn't give me any trouble. We were just confirming a few things.+…Alright, please keep up the good work.
()||<黑屏1>:…Call ended.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑屏2>:M99, the Commander just called and told me...+Your team was critically low on supplies during battle and you were ordered to open up the goods to use as emergency resupply, is that right?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Huh?+Uh…that's right…
M99(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Very well. This is an acceptable reason, but you should be honest in your report.+Only in this way will we be able to more suitably arrange and upgrade supply points and to prevent similar incidences in the future.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:I will be more careful next time. I'm terribly sorry for causing this issue…
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:On another note, your team did quite well in this mission.+Your team will be rewarded after we receive your evaluation from the settlement. Take this time to rest and recover.
()||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2>:…One hour later, the team gathered outside.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hawk, you roped the Commander into our lie, didn't you?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Hey hey, you can't call it a lie.+After all, we wouldn't have the authority to touch the humans' stuff if the Commander objected to it.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Yup, that's why the Commander is our accomplice now.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Chief, they already accepted the goods. Are you still feeling guilty?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Phew… Not anymore.+Since the Commander helped us out, it'd be too senseless of me to ignore Commander's goodwill.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:It's a real pity what happened to those persimmons… The soil here at Griffin's base can't grow anything even remotely as beautiful…
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:The same goes for the pork… Its plumpness is engraved into my neural cloud…
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hehe…
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:What are you giggling about, Chief?
()||:M99 opens a container by her feet.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Guess what I've got~
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Hey, isn't this…?!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Meat and vegetables… Just like the stuff from earlier!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Where did you get this from, Chief?!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huhu…well…
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:After learning that we finished the job on an empty stomach, the client gave this to me as a small token of appreciation before we left.+"Who can resist a cute T-Doll? A human deliveryman on the other hand would've surely been yelled at regardless of who's fault it was!"+...Hawk reasoned as everyone carried the food to the cafeteria.+At this point, I finally realize why Helian sent me as the team leader. It was all to give the client a better impression of Griffin.+I feel very honored to be a representative of Griffin, but one day I will prove my worth with my strength.+But today...I will enjoy the fruits of our labor.+I believe that as long as we work together, there is nothing that we can't do...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1/Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏2>:Oh, by the way, M99, don't forget to invite the Commander tonight.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:That's right. It was a long and arduous road. We need to share the spoils of war with our comrade in arms!+But does anyone know what the Commander likes? If the Commander doesn't like cilantro or Chinese onion…
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Yeah… I'm not sure what the Commander likes…+Which one of you wants to investigate?
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Speaking of investigation, I just heard some bad news, everyone. Very bad news…+Type64 is making her own Chinese sausages again…
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:What?!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Huh? So…?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||<震屏>:Type64's sweet Chinese sausages are salty! Is that even edible?!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Chief, you can't even call them Chinese sausages. They're bacon in disguise!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:That's… (I personally wouldn't mind…)
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Moreover, those things seem to have won the love of the old fogeys like 56R and 59 recently…+Our situation is becoming more and more dire…
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<震屏>:I'll make it clear that at least on the stance of sweet sausages, I'm on your side!+We must unite together to resist the revival of capitalistic ideologies!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:W-Wait a minute, do you need go that far...?
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Hawk, tell them you're making cola wings tonight. Have Type64 open the cans for you. +I guarantee her fingers will be bleeding all over within ten cans, and she'll be stuck in the Repair Bay for the rest of the night!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<震屏>:That's backstabbing! Don't do it!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<震屏>:This is called the people's conflict resolution! I'm going to get a case from 92 right now!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<震屏>:Hey, 56, stop right there! I won't let you have your way!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S/Speaker>||<震屏>:Jeez, Chief…+Things don't always go the way we want. Sometimes we can only accept that and move on.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What are you even talking about!+You guys, stop right now!
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Of course… Victory can only be achieved when we all work as one...+Perhaps next time I should listen to 64's and 95's ideas…
