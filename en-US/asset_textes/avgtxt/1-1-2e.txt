You completed the mission even though we've raised your enemies' level.+With such results, you'll be able to handle Sangvis raids of considerable scale.+Still, Sangvis T-Dolls are great not only in numbers, but also in making unpredictable maneuvers.+We'll do more focused practice next time. Dismissed.
