()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:In the control center. +Squad 404 finds the AR Team.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:9... You said we were going to look for M4A1, but...
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Even the AR Team are as still as statues, huh?
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What happened here...? Even the AR Team's stopped functioning...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:9, come take a look at this. +AR-15's connected to M4 by a cable. It seems they've already found where the problem lies.
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Do you want to try plugging in too, 9?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Oi, it's too dangerous to let 9 do something that even 45 couldn't handle.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I...could give it a try, if it's for 45...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(6)||:If even the AR Team members couldn't solve this problem, then there's no way you could deal with it with your specs. Don't act tough.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:But!
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:The sound of footsteps comes from downstairs. Step by step, they draw closer.
HK416Mod(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:What's...happening...? I can't move...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(2)||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Is it an enemy?!
HK416Mod(0);NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(0)||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Scheiße... Can't...raise my gun...
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(0)||:Is this a signal source for the forced connection...? Dammit, why can't I move even though I closed my ports...
UMP9Mod(4);NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:... +I am not here to fight.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NytoIsomer(0)||:I can't believe I didn't realize it all this time... You're the one who's disrupting the Griffin Dolls, aren't you!
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:I have seen too much death. +Our conflict is meaningless. +I have come to welcome her, who will then take us away. +Only through connection did I finally understand that I could never become her, whom others looked forward to. +But if she chooses to accept our everything, and abandon her hopes of becoming perfect, that too is what I desire. +The flowers of despair are about to bloom. There is little time left.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Isomer slowly walks up to M4, then places both her hands on M4's unmoving face and humbly falls to her knees.
