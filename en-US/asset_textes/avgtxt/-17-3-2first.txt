NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So, what did you find?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:How did you know?
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You haven't contacted me for half an hour. You must've found something.+The Military's armored units are still in place, which makes me very uneasy...
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Isn't that a good thing?
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:The Military has never taken the initiative to do anything good. They must have some other plan. +That Yegor is still in the field. I'm sure he's up to something.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Never mind that. Your job's half done once you get all the data, right?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0))<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I'm not one to halfass things, and there's no more data to uncover in the vicinity. +After all...we even managed to score a central server for a military theater. Our mission's been going a bit too well...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange... +Did you crack the theater server?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Huh? Of course not. +Someone already pried the firewall open by the time we got there.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...Didn't you ever wonder why that was the case?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I told you, we had no time to think about that back then... +Anyway, it was probably because the Military personnel forgot about it during their retreat and then it was hacked by Parapluie and opened up, right? +Though it's hard to imagine that S.F. has the ability to crack an important military server...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Hacked by Parapluie... +No, that's not likely. Even default military firewalls are beyond the ability of S.F. to get past.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So you mean...it wasn't Sangvis Ferri that opened the firewall? +All I could think about back then was staying alive, so I didn't have the time to consider that possibility.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:If it wasn't them, and it wasn't us, then it could only be...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Let's flip the script and think about it... +Interesting, I'll give it a go! +If it was the Military that opened the firewall themselves, and all this was part of their plan...does that make sense?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Remember what they did during the joint operation? +The Military charged all the way in, and then Sangvis Ferri was forced to fully activate Parapluie.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You mean...they deliberately let Parapluie spread? What good would it do for them?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Mastermind can see and control anything infected by Parapluie, be it a Doll or a server. +And then, the Military deliberately exposed their theater server to Parapluie, so Mastermind could see its contents... +But what would the Military want to show her...? +No...I can't think of anything. I don't have enough leads...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Persica, try looking at it from the opposite perspective. +What the Military wanted to show Mastermind was only bait. Getting Mastermind to "look" was the aim. +Does that give you any ideas?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:The Military...invited Mastermind into their own server? +What good would that do...?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Persica, put the Military's objectives together and then think about it. +The Military wants OGAS, and given the information we have, we can consider OGAS and Mastermind to be the same entity, so this should be the approach that the Military is taking to capture Mastermind...
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN><震屏>:...!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange... +What if...what if the Military also had Parapluie, or a more powerful electronic control method than the Parapluie virus?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:A more powerful method...?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:It's hardly impossible. +They're seasoned veterans when it comes to electronic warfare. Let's call the version they have Super Parapluie.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Let me think... +The military forces Mastermind to deploy Parapluie, which causes Mastermind to find the central server which the Military has deliberately exposed to her... +After that, Mastermind thinks she has successfully infected the server, and goes one step further to hack into the theatre server to control the military units. +The Military then uses its own Super Parapluie to flood Mastermind's infected sectors, which means they could...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Reverse the connection...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN><震屏>:Exactly! They use the connection to reverse-hack Mastermind with their Super Parapluie!
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Reverse-hacking?! +You mean the Military wants to...directly control Mastermind?! +Is that the Military's plan? Just to control S.F.'s Mastermind?!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:That was why they left M4A1 in place, in order to lure Mastermind onto the frontlines. It would improve their chances of reverse-controlling Mastermind several-fold. +But then why did they go out of their way to attack the AR Team when they left her alone on the spot?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:It's definitely weird. Maybe they felt that there was some advantage to be gained by letting M4 and Mastermind establish a link. +That was why I had AK-12 perform an emergency disconnect on M4. Whatever their plan was, at the very least we didn't let them have their way.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:And after that, they pretended to be beaten, then used their own central server to lure Mastermind in so she could be controlled.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You mean to say...the Military could be carrying out their reverse-control operation right now?! +Goddammit! I should have thought of that earlier! +So the tanks were just a ruse after all, huh!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Don't panic... Hacking a neural cloud of Mastermind's level will require a large-scale electronic battle. They might need a while to get ready. +They've never only prepared just one solution to deal with a problem. The armored units are probably a backup measure. +Ange, can you do any damage to them on Level II?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You want two or three T-Dolls to pull off something like that? What nonsense are you talking?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:I understand... The computational capacity of several T-Dolls simply isn't enough... +But at least we could obtain a sample of the Military virus, but then again there's not enough time to analyze it...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Okay, okay. You think of a way. I'll gather whatever information I can and pass it on to you. +I've got another question. If OGAS is so important, why have the Military left it there and fought with Griffin for so long, only coming to collect it now?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:... +Now...?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Yes, they let Griffin have the job for over a year and only came looking for it now...
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Perhaps...perhaps because OGAS was too dangerous. +The file you found in the theater server mentioned it, right? It's connected to the Relics...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:So...why now?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Lyco's AI had extremely powerful self-learning abilities... It was his masterpiece, though I didn't know what it has to do with OGAS. +But perhaps it has fully matured now, and someone in the Military knows that "she" is mature...
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Oh!
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:You've got a lead?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:There's only one person who knew Lyco's methods that well apart from myself... +And he hated Lyco to the core, while also being abnormally obsessed with Relics...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Wait, Persica, do you know...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:There was once a guy in 90WISH... +If he could have done anything to hurt Lyco... +Then he would definitely have done it!
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><黑屏1>:William... +I should have known it was you... +And here I thought...we'd never run into each other again!
