UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hmm, got it. +Rescuing the AR Team is our priority, correct?
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes. Remember our informant's comms channel and watch out for the cannons. +Mr Kryuger wants to see them alive.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We've never disappointed him... +Not since the very beginning, have we?

UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmm...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>6</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Oh, you awake?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Was that...a call from Miss Helian?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We have the last piece of intel. Time to set off.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Can't believe you actually took the job.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh? Is that strange?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Nah, not really. +But it's pretty cold. This is gonna take some getting used to.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph. We already have it way better than the AR Team. +They're still going in circles, waiting for the heliport to open.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:(Sighs) We'll have to do the same thing once the operation begins. +And 416 isn't gonna be happy about rescuing the AR Team...
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tee-hee. Since when have we received jobs that make us happy? +Alright, rub the sleep off your face. I'm doing the briefing.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:We'll need to enter from the east and take over an outpost in the north to give 416 and Gr G11 the chance to infiltrate the battlefield.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Are they already there?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They're on standby at the outpost in the north, studying the terrain. +9, have our maps been updated?
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Ja! All updated!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:There are two routes to go north...up here... +The one above is too heavily fortified. It'll be the safest bet to sneak in from the side.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll take that into consideration. +Now let's start moving. ♪
