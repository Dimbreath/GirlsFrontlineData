UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I didn't expect things to go this way. +Not only did we not do any real damage to them... +We even ended up losing 9 too. We might as well give up.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I agree. Or rather, you came to that conclusion too late.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, we have to be realistic about it. +Their luck is just ridiculous.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:And now you're pretending you didn't hear me... +Are you envious of them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Not in the least. +If you start to rely on luck in battle... +Then your career as a soldier is over. +Might as well go back to the factory or convert yourself for civilian use.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:After all, everyone's luck runs out eventually... +Though in their case, it probably won't be today.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I didn't think 9 would die that way. +I wonder whose death was funnier, hers or Gr G11's.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Well, it's just the two of us now.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What? Got a problem with that?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Quite the contrary - I'm practically weeping tears of joy. +You're the most useful one of them all.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Why, how generous of you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:<size=25>Oh, you're going to come in useful, alright.</size>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's nothing. +I'm done with this. They can sink or swim for all I care. +We don't have much time; according to that NPC, we ought to be entering the Dark Zone now. +Let's go.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're giving up so easily...? Well, I suppose that IS your style.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's saved your lives countless times. +I'm not a fan of doing something for nothing, you know.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Haha.
()||:As the two carry on their conversation, 416 suddenly notices that R93 is now in the middle of the street. +K5 runs over to her and they start chattering about something.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Wow, she appeared again. How does that even work?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:And she avoided an ambush, just like that. Lucky her. +...Wait a minute, look over there.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm?

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:She looks a bit different...but it's definitely her. +She's with the in-game enemies. +Something feels wrong about this.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's definitely fishy. Who knows if—
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang—
()||:Before 45 can even finish, the nearby battle has kicked off with a gunshot. +Like 45 has foretold, R93 and K5's luck finally runs out — within a few seconds, they are swarmed by rogue agents in a corner of the abandoned city.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:X Hellfire has killed Good Luck Doesn't Last. +X Hellfire has killed Philosopher Fairy.

UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A very practical proposition.+Leaving that weirdo aside, that huge pack of mobs around her is enough to get rid of us. +Looks like no amount of luck would be enough to deal with them...
()||:45's voice suddenly trails off. She looks at 416 with a shifty gaze. There's no telling what she has in mind.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What's with that weird look?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You must be mistaken. +Or am I being too excited, perhaps? +There's something I've wanted to try for a long time now. Looks like I might just get to experience it today.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Experience? +Look here—
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||:Warning! Major threat approaching!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—! +416's question is interrupted by an explosion. The shockwave sweeps them up and sends them rolling several meters before coming to a halt amidst handfuls of loose gravel.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Coughs heavily) +W-what the hell was that?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hey! On your feet!
()||:A note of panic creeps into 45's voice, and a gunshot brings down the shadowy figure behind 416. +Rogue agents have started surrounding them at some point. +Among them, their imposing leader looks at 45 and 416 with palpable disdain and menace.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:Found you...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk! We've been spotted! +Gott verdammt... We're totally outclassed here.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Not just that, she's incredibly vicious too. +Are you sure this is Vector?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Not anymore. +Her combat tactics aren't Griffin's style. +And look at her. Something's definitely off about her.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Good point. +At this rate, we might not even be able to escape. +...Right?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Why are you grabbing that stun grenade?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's been fun partnering with you, 416. +I think I'll treasure the time we spent together.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?!
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:!!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:BOOM—!!
()||<SE1>AVG_tinnitus_0</SE1>:Whum— whum—
()||:The "immobilized" debuff icon appears over 416's head thanks to the stun grenade. For a moment, she has lost all ability to react to her surroundings.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Scheiße! What the hell was that, UMP45!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oho, mad enough to call me by my full name? +I've always wanted to say a villainous line like that. +Besides, it's just a game, right? Don't take it to heart.
()||:As white noise fills 416's ears, 45's voice gradually fades away.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Stop screwing around! Hey! Get back here!
()||:Whum—
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...So one of them escaped? +No matter. Only one sinner will bleed tonight.
()||:By the time her vision is restored, all 416 can see are Hellfire and the rogue agents.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...Judgment is nigh.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What is this gibberish?! +I'm not fitted with translation software!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You've got to be kidding me!! Don't think I'll let this slide! 45, you bitch!!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang—!
()||:The moment the stun debuff wears off, 416 realizes that she won't be able to escape Hellfire unscathed and resolves to fight. +Though this was not her original decision, the old habits from when she was a professional elite Doll are deeply ingrained in her. +She reacts swiftly, dispensing a hail of blinding gunfire from her weapon's chamber, and in moments she has pulled away from Hellfire.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I knew it... This isn't Vector! +Is she another Doll of the same model? +Hey! Do you know anything about this?!
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do not engage!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I repeat! Withdraw swiftly—</color>

()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Grunts) Tsk! Forget it! +Now's not the time to be distracted, there's way too many of them here!
()||:Fortunately, being accustomed to working from the shadows, 416 is highly proficient in the use of cover. +Besides, there's something else that works very much to her advantage... +This game doesn't have a terrain destruction system, so to some extent, what seems to be flimsy cover is actually completely invincible.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>This wall would have gone down long ago if this were real life.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Fortunately, I can play some hide-and-seek with them thanks to it!</color>
()<Speaker>Rogue Agent</Speaker>||:!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Go to hell!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang—!!
()||:The rogue agents around Hellfire aren't very skilled, and to 416 they are nothing but amateurs. +The only thing about them that worries her is their numbers.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...
()||:The enemy that resembles Vector has extraordinary abilities, but it's obvious that she lacks the ability to think tactically and on the fly. +This greatly puzzles 416.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What the hell is that...?</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>Why does it look like Vector?</color>
()||:It's practically impossible to face such numerous foes with the amount of ammunition she is carrying. +However, escaping also proves difficult. "Vector" is very persistent and 416 is finding it impossible to withdraw in one piece.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What's this?
()||:As she runs to evade Vector's knock-off, 416 finds herself coming across the corpses of R93's two-man team. +As she sees R93's body, a memory of what happened not long before flashes through her mind.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...I have it. +This just might work.
()||:After checking the two pillars of light, 416 grabs the items she needs, then repositions herself behind another piece of cover, while also taking the chance to return fire in order to thin out the enemy's numbers.
()||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Step—
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||<SE1>Stop_AVG_loop</SE1>:You're struggling in vain... +The star of death is engraved in your destiny.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sorry about that, but trampling destiny underfoot is my motto!

()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang—
()||:The sound of brass casings tinkle crisply throughout the battlefield while 416's muzzle flashes more and more rapidly.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()||:The rogue agents' offensive actually falters for a moment under 416's ferocious counterattack. +Hellfire might be the leader of this enemy force, but she doesn't seem inclined to give any orders.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||:416's torrent of firepower can only lasts for so long. For a moment, all noise is suspended. The abandoned city is shrouded in deathly silence.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||<BGM>10254</BGM>:...Advance.
()||:Vision is already poor because of the bad weather, but it's even harder to discern the details of the environment amidst the dust and smoke. +Even Hellfire and the other enemies are susceptible to this impediment.
()||:Apart from the footsteps of the searching forces, there is no sound, not even that of breathing, on this silent battlefield.
()||:...Something is not quite right.
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...
()||:Hellfire stops moving, but the rogue agents around her continue forward. +She looks up, and her cold gaze sweeps the obstacles in the distance before it settles on a section of ruined wall.
()||:She raises her gun, and the other agents, taking that as an instruction, all make a beeline for that location. Naturally, they are peering through their scopes, fully focused in their combat stance.
()||:—Checkmate.
()||:—Click!
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage3</BGM>:Don't look down on me—!!!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—! +As the battlefield holds its breath, an explosion goes off under the feet of the rogue agents! +Before they even realize 416 is speaking from behind them, more explosions go off, one after the other.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:Boom!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:Boom!!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:BOOM!!!
()||:—It's a booby trap!
Vector(7)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...!
()||:Hellfire's gaze seems to be asking, "How did you appear from behind me?"
()||:Clang!
()||:416 gives Hellfire neither an answer nor the chance to react. The blade of her knife slashes upward, carving a vicious wound onto Hellfire's arm.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If you want to blame someone for this, blame 45.
()||:With that, a cold gun muzzle is pressed against Hellfire's forehead.
Vector(7)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:...
()||:Hellfire looks at 416, whose breathing is slightly erratic. Despite being so obviously overpowered, her expression remains unchanged. +She returns 416's gaze haughtily... +Though 416 can't fathom what justifies such insolence.
()||:—Whoosh!
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:—Bang!
()||:Before Hellfire can raise her savage-looking flamethrower... +416 has already ruthlessly put a bullet through her forehead.
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Pzzt... Pzzzzzt....
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What—?!
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:However, 416's foe did not collapse like she expected. +Hellfire's body suddenly twists and warps like the image on a damaged videotape.
Vector(7)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:... +...Congratulations, 416. +But blood...will be paid in blood.
()||:Pzzzzt—
()||:A dazzling light flares. 416 instinctively closes her eyes, and by the time she can see again... +Hellfire is already gone.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What the hell?
()||:416 carefully surveys her surroundings. Her sense of unease lingers. +It is only when she is certain that there is no sign of Hellfire pressing a counterattack that she finally relaxes.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Good thing what happened to R93 wasn't a fluke. Otherwise I honestly have no idea what I could have done.
()||:As 416 catches her breath, the remaining enemies start to regroup. +Even without their leader, they are still functional, and they soon redirect their attention to 416.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk... Never mind, time to split!
()||:But then she frowns in confusion.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Wait, what was that again? +She said my name, didn't she? Does she know me? +This whole situation is really fishy...
()||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Well, I won't be finding any answers here. +Let's move on.
