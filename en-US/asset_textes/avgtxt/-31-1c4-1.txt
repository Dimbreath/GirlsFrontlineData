()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:... + ...+M4 and AK-12 swiftly break through the enemy defense line and arrive at the door to the wall control room.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...The door's locked.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hang on a bit, I'm hacking the internal control systems of the wall.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Hurry it up, there's no telling what the people inside are doing.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm working as fast as I can. +After all, this equipment is intended to protect human lives, so obviously they'd be more careful about protecting it. +... +Alright, opening the door now.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood.
()||<黑点2><BIN>85</BIN>:AK-12 opens the electronic lock, and the two Dolls rush into the control room. +A soldier is operating the control panel in front of them.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You've got nowhere to run. Surrender.
()||:The rebel soldier ignores M4's warning and continues pressing the buttons on the control panel.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:This is bad! M4, he's planning to open the quarantine wall!
()||:M4 quickly steps forward and points her gun at the rebel's back.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Stop what you're doing and raise your hands if you don't want to die.
()||:The rebel soldier turns back and looks at M4 with a disdainful expression on his face. +A huge red warning message flashes on the monitor before him.
Rebel Soldier()||:A mere puppet like you can't stop us!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The rebel soldier quickly reaches a hand out to a button on the control panel.
()||<SE1>Gunkill</SE1><闪屏><duration>10</duration><rate>20</rate></闪屏><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:M4 shoots the rebel soldier square in the head, and the soldier collapses in front of the control panel like a sack of potatoes.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is it over...?
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 bites her lip as she looks at the human who now lies in a pool of blood.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1>:(...Is this really alright?)
OGAS()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:You hesitated, M4A1. +Your indecision nearly put the entire city in danger. And here I thought you were already used to killing human beings.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Was there really no other way to stop him? Why does it always have to be a matter of life and death?!
OGAS()||:You're naive, far too naive. Don't always think that you can reach a good outcome easily. +Only the victors get to live on. That was why you opened fire, isn't that right?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
OGAS()||<>:M4A1, we need to do the right thing. +That's the only way we can reach our destination...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just then, someone pats M4's shoulder.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:?!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN>:Talking to yourself again, M4? +Things aren't over yet.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What?
()||:AK-12 points to the communicator that has fallen beside the rebel soldier's body. +The faint sounds of a conversation can be heard through the device.
???()||:<color=#00CCFF>Attention, the operation to seize the control room has failed...</color>
???()||:<color=#00CCFF>Thus we have no choice but to enact the final plan.</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:As I thought...
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:AK-12 and M4 exchange looks. +After that, M4 dashes out of the control room.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I've finished pinpointing the message's source, I'll send you its location.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm on my way, delay them as long as you can.</color>
()||:AK-12 picks up the communicator. +...A low male voice comes from it.
Rebel Officer()||:<color=#00CCFF>Whoever's in the control room, you heard our conversation, right?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Unfortunately, everything you did was for nothing!</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You've already failed. If you want to keep your lives, I'd advise you to not act rashly.
Rebel Officer()||:<color=#00CCFF>Failed? Hahahaha... To think it'd be a little girl who stormed the control room!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Still, I'll tell you this. In order to ensure our plan went off without a hitch, our heroes have already rigged the load-bearing columns here with explosives while you fools were delayed by our comrades!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>And now, I hold the detonator.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>With just a press, this stupid quarantine wall will be blown to bits!</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Why are you doing this? Weren't you originally garrison troops? +Your duty is to protect your people! +Can you face up to the badges you wear if you let infected creatures into the city?
Rebel Officer()||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course we can! What we're doing is for the sake of peace and freedom!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>As for the people? (Snorts) ...They aren't even people!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Our people are locked outside the wall! The real people are starving, bleeding, struggling on the edge of life and death!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>We use our blood to protect those maggots in the city, but what have they done?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>They simply live within the walls without a care in the world, allowing those thieves who live on high to steal the fruits that we protect with our lives!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Let them bear the consequences of their weakness! Let them go to hell with the people up top!</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Do you want to die?! +If you push that button, both you and the rest of your unit will perish!
Rebel Officer()||:<color=#00CCFF>This is the battlefield, girl!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Since we're here, we have no intention of going back alive!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>All our comrades came here prepared to die. How could soft and weak running dogs like you understand our lofty resolve?!</color>
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You... You're a bunch of madmen!
Rebel Officer()||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, we're mad! We're all mad!!!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Everything's gone mad — hahahaha!!!!</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:M4! Look out! +These people are all insane!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>;AK12(2)||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Got it, I'll be right—</color>
Rebel Officer()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:<color=#00CCFF>Let this mad world hear our cry!!!!!</color>
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1>:BOOM!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:The purification tower collapses amidst a series of explosions. +The storm lashing the exterior of the walls quickly disperses the thick smoke generated by the blasts.
()||<火花>:By the time the dust and smoke clear, Ange can see a horde of burning Infected by the light of the fires on the nearby wall. They pour in through the gap in the quarantine wall and rush downhill into the city.
()||:Ange can hear many things. +She can hear screams, gunfire, explosions, and inhuman cries. +Those sounds of disaster blend into a chaotic mess and reach her ears over the communications channel. +The neat flow of cars on the streets near the wall seizes up, like a snake that's been cut into segments. +The thick smoke and firelight gradually spread outward along the streets. People flee in all directions, and Ange imagines she can hear their wails of despair. +Even Ange, who has witnessed countless tragic sights, cannot help but want to avert her eyes as she witnesses the horrific scene beneath her.
Angelia()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:Did your plan account for this too, K...? +It had better, otherwise the situation will be out of my control...
