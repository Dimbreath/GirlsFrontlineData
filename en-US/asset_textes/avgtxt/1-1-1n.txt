MG5(0)<Speaker>MchG5</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:Thank you for coming to give us a hand. Please allow me to brief you on this operation.+After Griffin had reclaimed Area S09, Internal Affairs planned to convert it into human settlement.+But just as the reconstruction began, our scouts suddenly reported that a vast number of Sangvis troops were stationed some distance away.+We need more exact information on our enemies as evidence for Miss Helian to negotiate with the construction contractor.+To that end, we need a T-Doll to check in with the others and acquire the newest reconnaissance report.+She's already in position, Commander. I'll let her say hello.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:G-Greetings. I am MP5 of Griffin.+Um... I believe you are the commander who reclaimed Area S09? It is an honor to meet you.+Now, to avoid alerting the enemy, we will be operating under the cover of night.+Night vision goggles would be a great help, and armor-piercing bullets would also be very effective against armored units.+Please guide me to the rendezvous point with the first T-Doll scout when you finish your preparation.
