Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Phew... We're safe...
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Damn that Baldy. Now I'm covered in mud on top of that gross stuff!
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...AUG, what did Dreamer mean... when she said I was the first to run last time?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> ;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Mulling so hard over what Dreamer said, huh? Have you forgotten what we need to do?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:... +You said we can still make it, but what can we do when all communications are down?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> ;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Reactivate the mortar we just disabled and lock onto Griffin's helicopter.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:What are you planning, AUG?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:There's no way for us to warn the airborne Squad Welrod. +Our only choice is to physically prevent the contents of the canister from reaching the Commander and the base.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:You must be joking!
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Fr√§ulein AUG most definitely isn't joking. She is dead serious... +And this IS the most effective option...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:I hope you finally realize how dire the situation really is. Your order, please.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:To destroy another squad for this... I can't give an order like that...!
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> ;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:What bothers you more, their partial memory loss, or the severe consequences of not doing so?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Enough! +Welrod entrusted us with their safety, and they must bring the evidence back. +There must be another way!
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> ;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:The facts are right before you. We have no other choice. +If Welrod were in your position, she would do the same.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:I'm not Welrod. I don't know what she'd do...
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> ;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Now you know why your missions always end in failure.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:It'll be fine as long as we can warn them, right...?! +Is there any way we can neutralize the signal interference caused by Parapluie?
Glock17(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:We don't have the time to track down which communication outpost the virus originates from.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> ||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:There must be some way we can warn the Commander. What about an eye-catching signal flare?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:It'll be too late by the time a drone picks it up.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Communication outpost... +Something... eye-catching...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Reactivate the mortar now when the helicopter is still within range. +Haven't you always wanted to be more reliable? +No one would blame you for choosing this, IWS.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Nein... That's it!
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position> <Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:What?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position> <Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:There IS another way... +No matter what, AUG, I will never open fire on an ally. This is my answer.
