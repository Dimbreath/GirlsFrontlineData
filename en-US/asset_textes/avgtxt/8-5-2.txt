()||<BIN>34</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：...Operation in progress. The sound of drone engines keep buzzing overhead.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：That seems to be the last batch. You alright, RO?
 ()||：RO combs through her hair roughly with her hand and lets out a sigh.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Even though the commander is doing everything possible to protect us...+Judging from the engine noises from outside, the drones are still there...+Our ammunitions are almost depleted. If they go for another round...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Just bear with it for a little longer. From what I see, only three waves of enemies are coming our way. The Commander has already cleaned off most of them.+SOP-II's download is almost complete, and we can retreat very soon.
M16(3);RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>：Is SOP-II... Will her neural condition be fine?+I know we're not using external equipment for the sake of efficiency, but surely this isn't healthy for her neural cloud.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(3)||：She'll be fine. She'll feel safe as long as she's with the team.+She may be manic in battle, but off the field, what you see is what you get when it comes to SOP-II. +Her neural cloud is surprisingly innocent, you know.
M16(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I really like her, and she doesn't hate me either...I think.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：She likes you, too. She told me that. You're both very candid, so you'll definitely get along.
M16(0);RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：But I envy her. I just can't calm down in the face of this...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(3)||：RO, if I tell you now, "Don't worry. Everything will be fine." Will you believe me?
M16(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Even though you often ignore my orders, right now...I do believe you, M16.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Haha. You catch on fast.
M16(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Hmm... Thank you, M16...
M16(0);RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I'm sorry... What I said...about not treating me as a substitute for M4...+I don't have much experience on the field. I really can't give the best orders in every instance...
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(3)||：Don't sweat it. You were pretty cute when you said that...+You actually sounded like M4 when she first started out...
M16(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...When she first started out?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：She was kinda ditzy when I first met her. Now...she's changed a great deal...
M16(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：That's really hard to imagine just looking at the reports.+I hope she wakes up soon. I can't wait to meet her myself.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(2)||：Haha, don't expect too much.+She isn't all that dependable, and will probably cause you lots of trouble.
M16(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：No, it's already a great honor for me to join the AR Team.+It's my wish to achieve victories worth commemorating and become an elite that protects Griffin.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Haha. Are all T-Dolls these days this gung-ho?+But don't say I didn't warn you. We can't save the world.
 ()||：RO bows her head and chuckles.
M16(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：It's fine. I'm prepared to sacrifice myself anytime.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(2)||：...You're not included in the 'we'.
M16(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：What?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Stop relying on us so much, RO.+You must learn faster. Time is running short...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...Clang!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：...!+SOP-II! Are you alright?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Oww... I'm fine. Just banged my head.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：Phew... Looks like the download is complete. Your body probably needs some time to adjust to your freed up RAM.+Alright then, we're getting outta here once SOP-II finishes her adjustment!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M16(3)||：...M16, what exactly...do I still lack?
RO635(3);M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Sorry, the Q&A session is over, RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Huh...?
()||：M16 smacks RO on the back.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：We're T-Dolls, and this is the battlefield. Don't think too much. Just enjoy the moment.+Someone will tell you the rest one day.
