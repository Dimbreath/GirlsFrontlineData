56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:We arrived even earlier than you. It's not like we've just been hanging around doing nothing.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The mansion isn't actually that big. +The actual area is a lot smaller than its exterior appearance may suggest, probably because of the thick walls.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I didn't expect the electrical room to be somewhere so obvious... +In fact, it can be very easily overlooked precisely because it's hidden in plain sight.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I noticed that when I was doing my investigation. Didn't expect it to come in useful. +This mansion's furnishings are very retro, but the electrical room is equipped with very sophisticated technology. +If all that power is just for the purpose of providing illumination, it's a bit of an overkill.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Without a doubt...there are other electrical appliances in this mansion. +Well done, Type 56-1. You've saved us a lot of time.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Sten, how does it look?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:It's just a normal tripped fuse. Nothing serious. +We'll just have to switch it back on.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:That's good to hear. Then let's get the power running again. +Miss Lee, please inform Miss MDR and have her return to the church as well.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:MDR, we've located the electrical room and restored power. Please acknowledge.
