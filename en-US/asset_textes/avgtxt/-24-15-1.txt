SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO...
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Shut up...
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, let me explain—
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I want you to SHUT UP! Pay attention and walk!
()||<震屏>:...Thump! +SOP-II nearly collapses onto her knees.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:SOP-II, are you alright?
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh... I'm fine, I'm fine... +Honestly, I can't control my body properly every time you kick up a fuss.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Whose fault is it that I have high-end electronic warfare modules?! Whose fault is it that I'm not the one controlling the body?!
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tell the Commander - pffffft!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Didn't mean to, my ass! Look at your face! Just look at your face! +Didn't we agree not to tell the Commander I ended up like this?! You should have pretended I was dead!
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But the Commander was so relieved after I said that, so live with it, okay?
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I should just kill myself...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:There there, you can change back to normal once we get back to HQ, RO.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How long is that going to take... +Cx4, how far away are we from the secure location that the Commander gave us?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:It's right in front of us, see—
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, look up, otherwise I can't see it.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Yes, yes—
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It looks like a temporary base, and it doesn't look like Griffin built it themselves.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Don't think about that. It's good enough that we've got a place like this.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm glad we get to regroup with everyone! We finally get to breathe a sigh of relief!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Still, someone's helping us, right? +I mean, consider the heavy weapons the Commander used to support us. That's not the sort of thing a PMC ought to have.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You know about that sort of thing, RO?
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I used to handle a lot of law enforcement work. Of course I'd know. +After WWIII, civilian organizations aren't allowed to have military weapons without special permission.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Mm, I know that. That's why we can only use these 50-year-old weapons, right?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Some T-Dolls have weapons which are more than 50 years old, hehe...
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't look down on them when they have the Imprint to make up for their performance.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But yeah, those heavy weapons mean we aren't an ordinary PMC anymore, right?
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That much was obvious the moment the Military turned on us... +I wonder what happened to HQ...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Huh? You don't know about them, RO? +Oh...that's right...
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏>:Ah! RO, we're here! We're here! +Look! It's the security zone! We're safe!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What happened at HQ?! +SOP-II! If you don't tell me, don't even think about stepping foot into the security zone!
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:Arghhhh! My right leg is out of control!!
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Shut it.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...?! 
()||:Everyone looks over and sees the T-Doll waiting up ahead.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You...you're...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:What are you dawdling for? Regroup already!
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This T-Doll... Who is she again? She looks kinda familiar...?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You find too many people familiar. Hurry up and get over here. +The enemy is about to launch their next attack. We must get everyone out of here before that.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Enemy? Has the Military fought their way here?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It's a new faction.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:A new faction? +Not the Military? +Not Sangvis Ferri either? +Then who are they?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No idea. +All we know is that they want to kill us deader than dead.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh...is that so? +Well, I don't mind as long as they're something I can kill.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's the problem. +Those things...that want to kill us... +They're...unkillable.
()||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2>:...Five minutes later, the team encounters the unknown enemy blocking their path.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You see those white things, SOP-II?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hm... I've never seen them before. What are they?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't know, but they're after us. And their firepower is at least as good as the Military's.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So we can only regroup with the Commander after we fight our way out of here?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We won't be able to meet up with the Commander for now. Griffin has their hands full fighting these enemies and they can't withdraw.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then we need to get rid of these enemies! No matter what they are, we can't let them hurt everyone!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Has SOP-II...changed?)
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We have the Commander and the HOCs. Taking care of enemies we see now isn't a problem. +Wipe them out as soon as possible. We need to mount a rescue at the next outpost.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Roger! Leave to to me! RO, Cx4 Storm, this is the first battle we're fighting with the Commander watching since we came back, so make sure you put on a good show!
