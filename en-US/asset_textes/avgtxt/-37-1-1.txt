()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I am always, always studying her. When she sits at her desk, showing nothing but her back... +Drawing strange lines, stroke by stroke with a quill made from goose feather.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...If I were capable of discerning beauty, I would definitely shower her with praise.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>238</BIN><黑屏2>:—When a comrade-in-arm who was just chatting with you casually a few seconds ago dies in a horrific manner... +The intense trauma could very well overwhelm you and make you snap. +Lee Enfield stares at PK, sprawled on the ground. Other than fury, she is also experiencing some other emotion – something she can't quite put a finger on. +The realization surprises her. +...She looks divine. +Lee Enfield cannot suppress the thought.
()<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:This...is horrible...
()<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Who was it?! Who the hell did this?! +Come out and fight us fair and square!
()<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:The ghost of a bride... +This is the curse...that MDR was talking about.
()<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Snap out of it! There's no such thing as ghosts in the world!
()<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Then explain what's going on!
()<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +No... +Ghosts do exist. +The "Ghost" known as the "Culprit".
()<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:What...
()<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...We're all going to die.
()<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:No. +... +We haven't finished smoking our three pipes yet.
()||<BGM>m_wv_scenario</BGM><BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Lee Enfield, Gr G36c, MDR, and Type 56-1 make their way through the woods.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:We're close to the target. Halt.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Target in sight. Everything seems to be in order.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Nothing seems out of the ordinary with the terrain either. +56-1, you were drafted into the team to fill an opening. Have you studied the mission files beforehand?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:That's the team leader's job, right? All I have to do is follow orders. +...By the way, I'm hungry.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Right, I see. +But just to be safe, give us a short briefing, MDR.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Okie-doke! +I'm warning you though – don't take this mission lightly. Our client means business.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:So what exactly do they want us to do?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:All in good time. Simply put... +The Commander has received a case from the residents in the neighborhood. They say that some kind of disturbing noise can be heard from that abandoned mansion over there from time to time. +According to urban legends, it's the helpless ghost of a bride who had her hopes dashed. +I volunteered for the job the moment I learned about that. +This is soooooooo interesting!
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Ghost? Like, an actual spirit?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:... +Isn't that a load of bullcrap? I can't believe the Commander even accepted such an assignment. +I know the Commander is nice and eager to help, but there should be a limit, right? +At this rate, if someone reported an alien invasion, we'd have to mobilize and sort it out ourselves.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Like I said, all in good time. +I knew you weren't gonna take it well, which is why I emphasized again and again to treat this seriously. +Don't underestimate my resourcefulness as a popular anonymous forum user when it comes to collecting intel. +At first, the Commander didn't think much of it either. After all, it sounded exactly like a prank.+But the Commander still sent me to assess the situation just in case.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:And?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I was in for a surprise. +Something IS wrong about this place. At the very least, the neighbors' claims about mysterious noises are true. + I say it's worth sending in a team to investigate.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:You're sure you're not doing this just for kicks?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Well, you all know what happened afterwards. +Which is why we're here now.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:So our job is to find the source of those noises, right?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes. +I know it doesn't sound like much of a challenge, but it doesn't hurt to remain vigilant.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Are you confident?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... +Does wine have tannins?
