()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Under the city of Belgrade.
()||:Even though every shot fired finds its target and tears a white unit to pieces... +The number of enemies blocking their way shows no sign of decreasing.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Trash is trash, no matter how many there is!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:But despite her bravado, Sangvis units keep dropping like flies all around her under the hail of enemy fire. +Soon enough, Beak finds herself heavily suppressed.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Trying to overwhelm me with sheer numbers? +Perfect. Now I don't even have to worry about wasting ammo! You're just begging to be killed!
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Get ready to...hmm?!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Suddenly, a ferocious swathe of bullets tears right through the white enemy's formation. Shot after shot accurately targets the deadly weaknesses on each and every white unit, taking all enemies down like a violent torrent.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:All clear. I'll go on and scout ahead.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Right, leave this place to me.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:It's you...! +I'm surprised to see that even Griffin dogs know how to repay a debt.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:This has nothing to do with the aid you provided earlier. We're merely clearing the path so that we may proceed smoothly.
AR15Mod(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Humph, funny you'd say that. Are you sure we're going the right way? +Why do you have to pick a path that's packed with enemies?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:More white enemies means more forces stationed around to guard something important, don't you think? +The fiercer their resistance, the more certain we can be that we're going in the right direction.
AR15Mod(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:That does make sense... +But when did you move behind me? The path is up ahead.
AR15Mod(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Besides, haven't I been following your butts the whole time?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Well, actually... It would seem someone wants to get off early.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker><Shake>||:??!!
()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:A blow on the back of the head with a blunt instrument... +Vision dissolving into black-and-white static... A distracting noise in the ear drowning out everything else.
()||:With a blank look in her eyes, Beak slumps unsteadily off her motorbike.
()||:Through the blurry visual snow, she can just make out AN-94 and AR-15 moving to the side of the passage and giving the wall a push...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well done, AN-94. +Good luck, Sangvis. You'll need it.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:...Freaking lackeys of mankind! Go to hell!
()||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Even though her vision is severely impaired, Beak still raises her arm with great difficulty and fires randomly at the trapdoor that Task Force DEFY escapes through until she runs out of ammunition.
()||:After an uncertain amount of time, Beak's eyes snap open. She jumps back on her feet and looks around.
()||:Other than her own motorbike and the pile of remains of the white forces, there is no sign of the two hostage Dolls.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Did they...hack me and overload my neural cloud?! +Dammit, they must've disappeared through here...
()||:Feeling along the wall the AR-15 and AN-94 climbed through, she finds the trapdoor. However, the lock has already been set to only allow one-way access. It can no longer be opened from this side.
()||:She smashes the electronic control interface of the door with a furious punch.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Arghhhh... Bastards! You bastards! You planned this, you rubbish Dolls!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:What's going on?
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:It's all your fault! You should've come sooner!
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:Oh yeah? We're already at the end of the underground passage. Our destination is just a few steps ahead. +The doors leading to the Pike Node is right in front of us... We don't need the guides anymore. We simply have to kill anything that tries to stop us from getting there.
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:Humph, and don't you sound pleased? +If they hadn't escaped, would you follow the plan and execute them once we secure the Pike Node?
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:We're here to complete a mission, not to chase after a couple of rats. +If we give Agent and Mastermind a complete account of what happened, who do you think will look more incompetent, you or me?
M16A1BOSS(0);Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||:You're a sneaky one... You always manage to find excuses for yourself.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||:You'd better try harder. It'd be awkward if my supervisor ends up being the one who needs supervision. +That little slip-up of yours was no big deal. After all, our objective concerns something far more important than the fate of two Dolls.
M16A1BOSS(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;Beak_M16(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I have another job for you. Don't screw it up.
Beak_M16(0)<Speaker>Beak</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Screw up? Humph, save that for yourself.
()||:Beak mounts her motorbike again and drives out of the underground passage in a separate direction.
()||:Meanwhile, M16 studies the end of the passage - the secret chamber locked behind a set of heavy doors underneath the ancient fortress.
()||:All the Sangvis units that survived the tumultuous journey through the subterraneon labyrinth gather behind M16 and follow her as they head toward their final destination.
