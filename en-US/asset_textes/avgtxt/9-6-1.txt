SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Huuuuuh? Are you serious?+A Sangvis T-Doll that ambushes and blocks our retreat route claims to be just and fair? Is a screw loose in her head?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：Perhaps Sangvis Ferri has run out of resources to produce proper T-Dolls, so they're sending all these weirdos out.+She still hasn't opened fire yet. Maybe she's just bluffing because they rushed her out the door without any proper weaponry...
RO635(3);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Perfect! I want to smash her into pieces! I've run the calculations, and a midget like her is enough to make 500 pieces!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：Wait, maybe we can get some information on M16 from her. Let me try to talk to her first.
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What's there to talk about with the Sangvis!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：What if... Just what if we can obtain intel on M16's whereabouts? Cover me, I'll negotiate with her.
RO635(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Fine...but if she so much as lifts a finger at you, I'll dump my entire magazine into her!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：Leave it to me.+So...Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SPSP, also known as..."Judge". That's your name, right?
RO635(0);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：......+I just said that earlier.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：Maybe we can talk!+We don't have to fight each other. Look, my finger's off the trigger!+You said that you have questions for us, and I also have some questions I'd like to ask. Why don't we exchange answers?
RO635(5);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：......+I do not think I have any answers for you. It seems that you do not understand your current situation...+I have not attacked you, but that is only because you are still of value. Do not be mistaken.+Give me the answers I seek, and I may let you go alive.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：Tch... Why are all the Sangvis like this? And here I thought this one would be easier to communicate with...
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：Heh, I knew that asking was pointless anyway.+Hey, midget, do you know why you're still standing there in one piece?+That's because this graciously benevolent lady forbade me from killing you with my own two hands for the time being... And when I say my own two hands, I really mean with my bare hands!
SOPII(3);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：What...did you just call me?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：I'll bear with it for now, because our Commander's echelons will be annihilating you pitiful Sangvis trash soon enough.+We'll be the ones asking questions then!+I'll make sure you won't even be able to cry or scream when we get our answers out of you!+That's because the moment your vocal system loses its value to us, I'll immediately rip it out and stick it under my boot as a shock absorber! Got it? Midget!

()||：......!+A laser beam grazes SOP2's ear.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：What was that...!
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：She actually has this kind of firepower...!
SOPII(2);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>：I've only been courteous with you so far because Master instructed me to be polite.+However, if you could see into my neural cloud right now, you would know how much I want to make you disappear.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：SOP II...it seems like you've enraged her.+To be honest, crushing her under your foot at this point may be a bit...
RO635(3);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：No one shall ridicule my height, whether they be Sangvis or Griffin.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：Is THAT the important part?!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BossJustice(0)||：Forget about the semantics! She's rushing our way! Prepare for battle!
SOPII(3);BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：A crime is a crime!+Before I let you answer my questions, I will burn this into your minds!
