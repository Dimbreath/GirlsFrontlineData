MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Report
MG5(0)<通讯框><Speaker>MchG5</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Looks like things are going smoothly. We were a bit worried whether this mission would be too much for you.
MG5(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Heheh. It is all thanks to the commander's guidance. I will also be careful.
MG5(0)<Speaker>MchG5</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Good. Then have you found the scout in the area?
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Um... I do not know where she is. Maybe she is hiding herself?
MP5(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:I'm scouting in enemy territory. Of course I'm hiding.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:Ah! Who is it?!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Hush... The Sangvis troops are right next to us. Stop shouting, or do you actually wanna die?
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Whispers) S-Sorry...Miss WA2000. What is your situation over here?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:My situation? I'm perfectly well, of course. As for the situation over here? Not so much.+There are armored bugs prowling all over the place. How did you manage to sneak in alone?
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Me? I am being escorted by a commander in this area.
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Huh? What?!+Hey! Why have we suddenly switched to the commander's channel?!
MP5()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Hush... Please keep your voice down. We are right next to Sangvis troops!
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:(Whispers) I-I know. You don't have to remind me...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Um... So you're the commander in Area S09?+Uh... Thanks for your help, and...+...That's all. I salute you. Over.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:Huh? Is that all?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:We're T-Dolls. We just have to carry out our missions.
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But...you seem to be blushing? Are you embarrassed?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:W-Why would I be?! Besides, I was born to fight. It's only natural that I'm not good with words!
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:So are you admitting or denying your embarrassment...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Shut up. Aren't you here for the recon report? You got it, so get lost already.
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Thank you, Miss WA. Here are some supplies that Miss G36 prepared especially for you.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Oh... Chocolate ice cream? As expected of G36. She knows me.+But don't you dare tell a soul... WA2000 loves ice cream? What a joke.
WA2000(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Um... I am very sorry...+But actually... The commander is still on the line...
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...+...Why didn't you say so earlier?!
