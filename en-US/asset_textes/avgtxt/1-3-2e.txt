NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Nice! Things went just as smoothly this time. I'd expect nothing less from you, Commander!+Such results will surely win your points in the higher-ups' books.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Hmm? You've got something to ask, Commander?+The conflict...between Griffin and Sangvis Ferri?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmm... I don't know much more than you do.
Kalina()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>19</BIN><黑屏1>:However, do you know...how all hell broke lose in Sangvis Ferri within a single night?+Rumor has it, that a sophisticated AI is behind the whole thing.+It disobeyed the commanders at S.F. and seized control over all the T-Dolls in their factory.+Still, this is just the result of Griffin's preliminary investigation. Everything is still shrouded in mystery.+As for what that AI has cooking on the stove, nobody knows.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>:But don't you worry. This isn't where Sangvis Ferri and Griffin duke it out.+All you need to do is perform your duties and fend off the occasional minor attacks initiated by S.F.!
