RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Commander, the data finished downloading.+We're in the process of retreating. The plan isn't too practical, but this is the best we can do.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Bad news, RO!+A gate on our retreat route has suddenly been shut!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Dammit, Dreamer! If we make a detour right now...+SOP-II, keep tracking their movements. I'll discuss this with M16!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Calm down, RO.+I have a rough idea of the schematics of this base. There's a chance to make it out if I blast through the side of the gate.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：It's too risky to split up, M16!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：That's exactly why I have to do it.+Who do you think is most up to this job?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Will it...really work?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：It's worth a try, but first we need to get there.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：The Commander is sorting it out.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>：Our reinforcements are engaging the Sangvis Ringleader in battle.+They're doing their best to fend off Dreamer and Destroyer to give us a window to make our retreat.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：That's good to know. Then this is the only immediate danger we're facing.+RO, just a word from you and I'll get it done.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Understood... Then let's wait for the signal!+We'll set off once the Commander repels the enemy forces for us!
