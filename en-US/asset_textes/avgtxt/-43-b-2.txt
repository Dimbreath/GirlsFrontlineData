()||<黑屏2><BIN>298</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:... +On Sixth Avenue. +After losing VSK-94, AK-47 leads the remainder of her squad onward, but due to "circumstances beyond control", the formerly motivated squad's fighting strength has been cut in half.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hahaha, it's down to the two of us.
AK47(2);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Those two were real jerks~ +What do we do now, leader? +It's down to us.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;A91(0)||:We'll be enough. +Hell, I could do it by myself, no problem!
AK47(2);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Oho! Aren't we confident.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Da! The ten million is ours!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Woohoo!
()||:After a rousing fist pump, the pair fall silent.+Their designated straight man is gone, and there are no enemies around, so the two of them have nowhere to vent their hot-bloodedness.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...I'm kind of not feeling it, you know?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Man, why isn't there anyone around now?
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:Decrease in body temperature detected.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:We don't need you to pity us!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Shh... Hang on a bit.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hm?
()||:AK-47 suddenly lowers her voice and scurries behind cover.+A-91 hasn't figured out what's going on yet, but she blearily apes AK-47's movements and gets behind a stone wall opposite her.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hey, what's this all about...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Sssh.
()||:AK-47 shushes A-91 with a finger and gestures at the other end of the road.+A-91 looks in that direction — a pair of familiar figures slowly round the bend at the junction in the distance.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:!
()||:It's Vector and PP-90. +For some reason, they seem to be in the same situation as themselves.+R93 and K5 are no longer with them, and no one appears to be performing rear guard duty.+A-91 narrows her eyes and looks toward her squad leader, who has a somewhat mischievous look her face.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:~
()||:AK-47 presses her index finger to her lips. A-91 nods in understanding.+She points to the pair advancing cautiously in the distance and gives AK-47 a meaningful look which roughly means, "What do we do about them?"+AK-47 tilts her head in thought, then suddenly sticks out two fingers upside down and waggling them in a walking motion.+A-91 freezes, then gives her an "OK" sign, indicating that she understands. +After that, she takes a deep breath, then takes up her gun, ready to charge out.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...!!!!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:??
()||:AK-47 hurriedly stops her.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...
()||:AK-47 points to the other pair, then traces a circle in the air. After that, she makes that walking gesture again before choking herself.+A-91 frowns. She doesn't seem to get it.+AK-47 sighs, then points to the other two people, then gestures at herself with her thumb.+A-91 seems to get that.+AK-47 smiles, then uses both hands to mime a a pair of walking people, who separate and travel along two large curves in the air before coming back together.+Comprehension dawns on A-91.+AK-47 gives her an encouraging look.+A-91 accepts it with a big thumbs up.+AK-47 returns it with a glance of approval.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
()||:As the other two approach, AK-47 and A-91 exchange a final look.+They see mutual approval in each others' eyes.+Having arrived at a shared understanding without saying a word, AK-47 turns and vanishes down an alley in the opposite direction.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Phew...
()||:A-91 takes a deep breath once more. Now that there's nobody to stop her, she pauses, then raises her gun and charges out into the open!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hold it right there!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...A-91!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Whoa! She's here!
()||:Naturally, the startled pair immediately go on their guard.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You sure did us dirty earlier~ +Let's see where you can run now! Heheh!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You might try to affect the laugh of a middle-aged man, but you're just an ordinary beauty.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hm? A beauty? Aw, come now, flattery isn't gonna get you...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That said, nobody would go out of their way to make an ugly female Doll.+You aren't rare or anything, and you act just like a middle-aged drunkard. I guess you aren't attractive after all.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Why you— Die, damn you! Dieeeeee!
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:What's all this about dying... Speaking of which, are you alone?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Yeah, where are your other three buddies?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Don't change the subject! +And don't think you're getting away this time!+If you get it, then be good and hand over your vodka and your other alcohol!+I might consider going easy on you if you do!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:This game doesn't have vodka or other alcoholic drinks, right? Did you get separated from the others?+That's why I told you not to drink so much...+Didn't you learn anything from the pajama party?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Heh, heheh. I have to hand it to you, Vivi.+As cool as ever, even when you're on death's door. +You don't really think I came out completely unprepared, do you?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:You mean the others are hiding? Doesn't seem likely.+I doubt a bunch of drunkards could come up with any complex strategies.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Ahahahahaha!+Only you could remain cocky at a time like this, Vivi!+They say you're good at recon and anti-recon, but if you ask me, it isn't all that amazing!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Did I miss something?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Maybe if you beg me at the training range next time, I might tell you! +—AK-47! It's time! Do it!

A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...Hahaha! Got you, didn't I! This is our plan! Unexpected and taking the enemy by surprise!+Hey! AK-47? Now's a good time! Show yourself already! Did you hear me?! Get out here right now! Oi!

A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...+...+...Hahaha!+I was just kidding, see, I was just, uh, having a laugh with you!+Take your time, you two! I'll buy you a drink when we get back!+G-goodbye!

A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>299</BIN>:(Pants heavily)+Govno! You screwed me good, AK-47!！
()||:A-91 grits her teeth. She recalls her disgraceful exit just now and it's plain that she's still very unhappy about it.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Once was bad enough, but now I let them strut off like that again...+How can I possibly live with that?!+Oi, AK-47!
()||:A-91 frantically barks at the communicator, but there is no answer.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Arghhh, forget it!+I'll just have to do it myself! ...Let's see...
()||:A-91 checks her backpack. +Apart from the ammo and food she has collected earlier, the bulk of its contents are explosives.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...
()||:It looks like Vector and PP-90 are headed to the Dark Zone too.+While there are many ways to get to the Dark Zone from Sixth Avenue, only one of them is the shortest...+And Vector doesn't seem like the kind to go the long way around.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:I've got it...
()||:A-91 shuts her inventory screen as a perfect plan hatches in her mind.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...Let's take a look at the map.+Oh, there, that's it!+Judging by the direction Vector and PP-90 are headed, they'll have to pass through here.+If I can get there ahead of them and plant all the explosives in my backpack...
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:BOOM! They'll be blown to kingdom come!+Haha, I AM a genius! +Hahahaha!

AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Hic) +Man, why isn't A-91 here yet? She's so slow.
