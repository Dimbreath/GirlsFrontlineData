G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hey, 416, you see that? Those...
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:I don't see anything.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Huh?
G11(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm not seeing anything. At least not now.
G11(0);HK416(0)||:
()||:416 points at 9's transmission request and takes the call.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Ah... Okay... +But why is the network filled with enemies? +I thought this was just a quick errand. Turns out it's another fight...
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Stop complaining. +This is probably the defense 45 put up to protect her own neural cloud. Amazing. It's still pretty solid after that kind of attack...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Don't praise her for that. We have to kill them one by one. Such a drag...
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm also working my butt off here issuing orders to the echelons to keep you two safe!
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:How nice. You can have a go at being the commander thanks to this electronic warfare thingy.
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey, you think this is a walk in the park? Though I can kinda do it on Level II, it's still eating up a lot of my RAM. +Now that I think about it, it's seriously hard work being a commander. I would've collapsed by now if we were in reality... +Well, wanna try it for yourself, Gr G11?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP9(2)||:Let Gr G11 give commands? Her neural cloud would go up in smoke before she could even finish organizing the echelons. +If you want me to die, at least let me die with some dignity.
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey, that tongue of yours is getting sharper and sharper. You were such a sweet and earnest thing back when we first met.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Humph, all thanks to this big happy family that's Squad 404.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That's enough banter. Let's return to the subject. +What's the condition of 45's neural cloud? Can you start repairing her yet?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP9(0)||:Hmm... Not yet. The connection is established, but her consciousness was smashed to pieces. +We must recover more of her cloud data to wake her up.
NPC-Deele(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Understood. Then let's keep going. +Oh, and 416... Did you two see...anything about 45?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP9(0)||:Thought you'd never ask.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:My preset personality has always been pretty candid.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:This isn't the time for history. Just concentrate on issuing commands.
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Sighs) That doesn't sound good.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:What did you expect?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You're right, I should've known... So I'm gonna hand command over to Gr G11 and explore the network with you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Get real. The current arrangement is perfectly fine. +Keep us safe and leave everything till after we come out of this alive.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Got it! Then please push on!
