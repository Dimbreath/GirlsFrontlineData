()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Battle1</BGM>:The previously raging blizzard soon settles down and the night dyes the city in a dark navy blue. There is a brief scream, and a swathe of brilliant orange blazes up at the origin of the sound.+Flames spew forth with a "fwoom", melting every snowflake they touch.+A pair of black-faced, petite figures rush out of the smoke left in its wake. They're trying to flee this danger zone as quickly as possible, but...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Ehhh?! Why is there a dead end here?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Because we ran the wrong way just now!+Eeeeeep! That big guy's coming this way!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Oh no, we're doomed!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fwoooom!+The flames billowing forth from the Cleaner fill every corner of the cramped blind alley.+However, when the flames finally recede, there's a conspicuous lack of scorched targets.

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Wow, that was close!+It wasn't real fire, but seeing it spray toward us was really scary!！
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:For a moment I thought I could feel my neural cloud overloading.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Good thing you can climb into these small buildings through the windows, so we didn't have to experience that for real. However...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 places her index finger over her lips to indicate that they should be quiet. After that, they can hear their massive opponent walking outside with slow and purposeful steps, as well as the sounds of rustling fabric as he vaults through a window.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:So that window...was just big enough for him to enter too?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter! We can escape as long as we can open the main door!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...Huh? +Hey! T-the door's locked!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Locked?!+Uh, let's head upstairs first, there might be enough space to avoid him on the second floor!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Ah, wait for me...
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:...Hm?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Why did you stop all of a sudden?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:The door leading upstairs...is also locked.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Ehhhhhhhh?!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:We're totally screwed now.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Is this the end?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position><Delay>0.5</Delay>||:...Well, it's not like we don't have a way out of this.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Do you have a plan?!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:You stay here and draw his fire. How about that?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Ehhhhh?! In a place like this?!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Relax, it won't take long. I'll go find the Boss and come back right away to save you.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Really?

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:...Alright, then. I believe you, so come back quick.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Hehehe, just wait there for my good news—
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Ehhhhhhh?! A f-f-flashbang?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hee hee hee~ +Kids might fall for that, but you think it'd work on me? Dorks like you are the best sort of bait. So long—
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>0.1</Shake>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Uwaaahhh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bang!+Just as P7 is about to leave, another flashbang goes off under her feet. She stumbles backward and collapses onto ART556.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The footsteps from downstairs draw closer and closer. They can hear hard leather soles trudging on the wooden floorboards in a slow and even rhythm.+At the same time, the two Dolls have finally come to their senses and gotten back to their feet, pulling out all their various hidden explosives.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Hehe, so you came prepared.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:I could say the same about you as well.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Well, no matter how this turns out, it was nice knowing you.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:That said, it's time to settle this, right here and now!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:<size=55>COME ON!</size>
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:<size=55>BRING IT ON!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The pair throw all their explosives at the opposition, and just before the glare of the explosions scrambles their vision, the two of them see the same thing—+The Cleaner, who was charging out to attack them, magnificently catches the explosives with their body.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BOOOOM!!!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After the thunderous explosions, their huge attacker, who was still radiating menace just a moment ago, rolls back down the stairs.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:...+It...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:It...?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:It worked!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Ah... Ahhhhhh!+That's right, that was our plan, wasn't it?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Of course, of course!+It was so perfect that even that big lug couldn't see through it!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Yeah! Ahahahaha!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Ahahahahaha—!+...Okay, let's go re-arm ourselves.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Yep...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 and ART556 are united again by their bizarre battle, but they are in no mood to resume their game of cops and robbers after that emotional roller coaster.+What had once been a wild ride of seizing loot has now ended due to them losing their way.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>297</BIN>:—Not too long ago, on the roof of the New York Public Library.+Three Dolls that have been hiding in the shadows have just finished enjoying the farce that unfolded inside the library.<下雪></下雪>
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Ahahahaha! A hot-blooded "NY cop" on one end and a gentle "pacifist" on the other.+The two of them clashing was more entertaining than I expected.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It was only average by the standards of free theater, though.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Still scowling, 416?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:We have done NOTHING but hunker down here watching other people fight ever since the battle began.+Is this your "sure-win" plan in action?
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Aw come on, you threw that flashbang just now, didn't you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:That doesn't mean I'm okay with dawdling up here with you.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I didn't expect this of you, 416. So you had your sights on the money all along?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:I didn't even want to take part in the first place, but since I'm here, I might as well put in some effort.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But of course. However, I think we ought to recover some useful items from our opposition before we enter the Dark Zone.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:We could have obtained all their supplies if we had attacked just now!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Attack them? It's more fun to watch them run around like headless chickens for the sake of a little resource grab.+Once they've worn themselves out, we can reap the harvest. Their supplies will be as good as ours.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:An Agent has entered the Dark Zone.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:Oi, you saw the notification, right?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Tsk, this is a waste of time.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey, 416, where are you going?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Looking for supplies.+You can take your time watching other people. +Once I take first place, I'll come back and see if you're still around.
UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh... She's gone.+She seems really intent on taking the prize by herself. Are we really going to just keep observing, 45?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416 is serious about everything she does. All she wants to do is end the game quickly.+Still, we've already lost Gr G11, so we can't afford to be stretched any thinner. In that case, let's follow her.+Who knows, we might run into something interesting along the way.
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>297</BIN>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Long after the farce in the NYPL has ended, and after UMP45 and UMP9 have followed 416 off the roof, the two lost midgets run up to the building—
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Ah! We're at the library, 556!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I'm sure they're not here anymore. Didn't you see the notification just now? I'm guessing it was the Boss and 94.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:So they've entered the...what do you call it, the Dark Zone?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:It's pretty likely. You can tell from the map that we're very close to the Dark Zone. If we head over there now, we might still be able to catch up with them.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Wait a minute, we haven't explored the area ahead yet, and if we run into enemies again...
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:As if we'd run into enemies on every single route. You're being paranoid.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:B-but I just saw a sign on the road saying something about a Last Man Battalion camp up ahead...+Hey, wait up!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:We've got no time to waste...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Eeeeek—?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ART556 has completely dismissed P7's concerns, but then a bullet whistles through the air past her ear.+She stops abruptly in her tracks and rolls behind a raised flowerbed. When P7 catches up, the two of them see a horde of heavily-armed enemies swarming towards them.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Battle1</BGM>:This...this is an enemy stronghold!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:So what, we can always double back— Aaaaahhhhhh!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Why are there enemies behind us too...? No, wait, have we been surrounded?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:I TOLD you we should have stopped!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Well, there's no point saying that now. Anyway, it doesn't look like we'll be able to handle the enemies with just the two of us.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Jeez. It's just a game, but I'm getting a really strong sense of déjà vu from this.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:I know right, the feeling that you're going to have to re-download yourself from a neural cloud backup?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:While I know that isn't possible here... It really feels like it's going to happen! I hate it!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:But that's not a problem, right? We can always play another round.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Of course it's a problem. Whether or not we can get back to such a good position again is one thing, but it would be a shame to go when we've got so many unused items in our backpacks!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:And here I was thinking you were attached to our fire-forged friendship.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:We have one?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:We should, right? I mean, we've come this far together!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Well, if we do, I was hoping you'd use it to take a bullet or three for me.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:What a coincidence, I was thinking the exact same thing.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:...
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:You know, if it wasn't because we had a mutual enemy to deal with, I'd like to see which of us was better.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:You took the words right out of my mouth!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The pair's argument is soon drowned out by the sound of gunfire.+The onslaught of the LMB forces is ceaseless, and even the greatest efforts of P7 and ART556 combined cannot stem the tide.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Suddenly, ART556 and P7 hear gunshots coming from outside the combat zone.+The LMB forces collapse one after the other, just as P7 and ART556 had hoped. Before long, the enemies closing in on them have been utterly eliminated.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:P-P7?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)<Position>0,40</Position>||:Yeah, I see it.
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:It must be the Boss! She came back to save us!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Look, over there!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:They look in the direction P7 is pointing at, and they can see a figure slowly advancing towards them, cloaked by the wind and snow.+ART556 and P7 happily jump out of their cover and run towards the figure, but as they draw closer, the silhouette resolving into clarity does not match that of M870's.+They slowly grind to a halt and watch as the figure walks up to them.
VectorAgent(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Are you alright?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene2</BGM>:Vivi? It's Vivi! 556, Vivi saved us!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Is-is that really you, Vivi?! Thank goodness! We didn't know you were playing too!+Speaking of which, what's with that outfit of yours...?

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:What do you mean "a little"? If Vivi teams up with us, winning will be a cinch!
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Is she really that amazing?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Looks like I backed the right horse, then.</color>
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:This NPC keeps saying weird things, doesn't she? +Right, Vivi, let's team up. You can't just leave us to face the enemy alone on such a cold night, can you?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't you two already have a team?</color>
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Silence, NPC!

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:(Sighs) Well, that's a shame. If you were willing to join us, I'm sure we could give those "criminals" a good smackdown.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Obey...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Huh, did you guys hear that?
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Sounded like...a radio transmission.+Did you say something just now, Dima?

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:It's who? Hey, did the signal cut out?+Seriously, at a time like this...mmmmppph!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as ART556 is about to launch into a round of complaints, Vector claps a hand over her mouth. Outside the cover, another figure steps off the road and approaches them.
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene3</BGM>:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:<size=35>Who-who's that?</size>
VectorAgent(0)<Speaker>Vector?</Speaker>;P7(0)||:The enemy.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Th-the enemy?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As the obscured trio watch on, the "enemy" comes to a halt, and after a brief pause, she suddenly turns to look in their direction.
ART-556&P7()<Speaker>ART-556&P7</Speaker>||:—!!!
VectorAgent(0)<Speaker>Vector?</Speaker>||:Ssshhh!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Vector gestures for her two companions to keep quiet, then glances over again. The opposition's gaze has already shifted elsewhere.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:(Pants) That scared the crap out of me!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Vivi, she's a Doll, right?+She looks weird, though.
VectorAgent(0)<Speaker>Vector?</Speaker>||:Not weird. Dangerous.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Dangerous, you say? +She's alone. If the three of us charge at her together, we might be able to...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Vector shakes her head and interrupts ART556.+More footsteps can be heard from behind the cover — nearly ten men dressed like agents step into view from behind the enemy.+They are all heavily armed and armored, and the watches on their wrists glow with a blood-red light.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Th-there are so many of them?!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:G-good thing Vivi stopped us. Otherwise...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ART556 doesn't dare imagine themselves being surrounded again.+It seems the enemies beyond have not yet discovered their presence. After a short while, they depart as a group.+As the sound of footsteps fades into the distance, ART556 and P7 finally breathe a sigh of relief.
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Must...obey...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,40</Position>||:Whoa!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Eeeeep!
VectorAgent(0)<Speaker>Vector?</Speaker>||:...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Having completely let down their guard, ART556 and P7 almost jump out of their skins when the voice speaks again from behind them.+By the time they turn around to look, the enemies have already had the three of them completely surrounded.
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Join us, and build a new order.+Or else...

Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:A battle seems to have taken place here. Some things were dropped on the ground.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:I guess they must be left behind by eliminated players... Looks like two players died here.
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:D-don't tell me they were ambushed? W-what if they've got their eyes on us too...? +Vivi, maybe we should meet up with R93 and K5, don't you think?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:You can go look for them on your own...
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Then forget it, I feel safer with you than I do with them, Vivi!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:(Sighs) Why must you stick to me like glue, anyway...+Speaking of which, why do you think the winner of this fight didn't take anything from them, considering supplies are so hard to find now?
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:That's because everything here is ammo and weapons, I think.+I get the feeling food and water are what people really need right now.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:...We need ammo too. Take it all, we'll go search somewhere else.
Vector(0);PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Hm, ISAC just said that I'm starving. I don't really feel it, but does that mean I'm going to die if this keeps up?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:I think you still have a can of rations left. Might as well have it since you're hungry.

Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;PP90(0)||:I'm actually quite impressed by your self-control.

PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Uh, wait for me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Upon further examination of the area, they conclude that there are no more present threats.
