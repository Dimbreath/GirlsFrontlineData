M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Squad 404! How are you holding up?!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ange seems to have forgotten that 404 was never meant to fight pitched battles like this... (Coughs) Things aren't looking too good...
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hurry up and think of a solution with that devious neural cloud of yours, UMP45!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Even the most devious neural cloud can't shoot through 150mm of armor plating.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What about Ange's last resort?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's not time yet... Ange hasn't given the order...!
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Griffin signals, 750m on the right flank!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is it the Commander?!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4! 45! Do you copy?! The Commander and I are exchanging fire with the Military! +We'll delay them, so use this opportunity to pick your way through their scattered units! You MUST find Mastermind! Do you hear me?!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416 and Gr G11, get on that tower up there and provide fire support! +M4! Come with me and 9! We're taking the shortest route!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What do you mean shortest route, are you trying to commit suicide?!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:From what I can see, their tanks can't shoot at low angles! +Draw their fire away from us! If we move fast enough, we might have the ghost of a chance to do this!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk! You're all insane! Gr G11, get up, we're moving!
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:R...right away!
