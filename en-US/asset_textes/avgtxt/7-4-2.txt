()||<BIN>47</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Meanwhile, within the detention center codenamed “Mario's Princess”.+Medical Room, 4/F. An hour into the counterattack.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：U-Um, FNC! I'm out of ammo!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||：Hmm... But I can't let you have mine.
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||：Hey! What are you doing? Didn't I tell you to hold your fire here?!+There are too many of them on the floors below! We're gonna be wiped out soon!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：But we still haven't finished off the enemies here!
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：But there are more of them downstairs!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：But they're still very far from us!
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||：But they have a much longer firing range!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：But the enemies here have more firepower!
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||：Hmm... You do have a point...
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<震屏><黑屏1>：Ahhhhhhh!+No commander, and no preset stratagem! What should I do?! Somebody please tell me!
()||<黑屏2><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>：...BOOM!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：Um... The floor below seems to have cleared up!+Huh? You...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Everyone cease your fire and retreat to the dormitory common room on the third floor!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：Huh? You are...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||：You're not a member of our team, but you can give us orders??
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Who cares! Just listen to her and retreat!
()||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>：Dormitory Common Room, five minutes later.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：M4, Skorpion's group is the last batch. All T-Dolls on the second to fourth floors are all here.+（Hands over）The ones on this list are too seriously injured for further combat.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Got it. I shall assign suitable units to care for them.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：But what about the ones on the first floor and in the basement?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||：We make our way down there and bust them out, bien sur!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：But...the signal is completely jammed. Barging our way through will surely be dangerous...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||：Calm down, you lot. It's not like we don't have a commander here.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Commander? But the commander ISN'T here...
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：(Whimpers) The commander hasn't come... Maybe we've been left for dead...
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||：Hey, enough with the rubbish!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Everybody please listen.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：Have you noticed? The Sangvis attack has significantly weakened compared to an hour ago...+Which means the commander has been destroying a lot of enemy units on the outside - for our sake.+The commander has made it in time and is doing everything that is possible to aid us...+Now we only have to finish off what is left of the enemies, and we will be safe.
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||：But how do we make it down there? We don't even have something that remotely resembles an autonomous stratagem...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：That is unnecessary. I shall command you.+I am a special T-Doll developed by 16LAB and equipped with a highly efficient module for issuing commands.+If the occasion calls for it, I can give orders in the commander's place. Even if electronic communication is down, I can give verbal orders.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：So...that means...you're our commander for now, right?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||：Uh... But we saw you once before, and you were super suspicious back then...+Besides, wasn't Skorpion set up by the AR Team?+They used her then just let her get captured by Sangvis Ferri...or something...
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：...+No, that's not what happened...
VZ61()<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><平移><BIN>20</BIN>：I was abandoned by my original commander on the field along with some other squads...+Agent from S.F. brought along so many units we were almost completely overwhelmed...+If it hadn't been for M4, we'd probably have met our end then and there.
VZ61(1)<Speaker>Skorpion</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>：So I trust her. Or at the very least, I trust her abilities!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||：I-I also think it's worth a shot! It certainly beats cowering in here!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||：Ugh... If that's what everyone has decided on...+M4, you'll get us all out of here, right?!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||：(Nods) I will.+I will try my utmost best in being a temporary commander and lead us all to victory.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Don't just try. Do it.+Tonight, we MUST survive!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：... (Nods)+Everyone move according to my orders!+Let us make our way out of this place!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：I must stop eating my heart out...+I have to live... Make use of my abilities...and live through this with my friends!
