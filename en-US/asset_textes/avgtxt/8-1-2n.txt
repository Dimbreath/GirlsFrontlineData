()||<BIN>46</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Combat concluded. Griffin forces storm the Sangvis outpost.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Clear. Squad Welrod, we'll hold our positions and cover you.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Victory shall accompany those who trust in it. We'll leave it to you, then.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Phew... Hopefully everything will go well.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:You look relaxed for the first time tonight, Leader.
Glock17(0);IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Oh? How did I look like before?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Distaste had encompassed your entire face.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:I wasn't aware... +Hmm... I hope Fräulein Welrod and her team didn't notice that...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Are you not satisfied with the Commander's arrangements to have us work with Squad Welrod?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:The only thing I'm dissatisfied with is... my own inexperience.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Your self-reflection lifts my spirits. +Seeing as how things turned out in our most recent mission, that is definitely a good takeaway from it.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:With Squad Welrod with us this time... perhaps I don't have to be too worried. +It just bothers me so much that we suffered a bitter defeat at the end of the line because of my foolish mistake.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:... +Being bothered by that is fine. However, you're trying too hard to do everything perfectly. Your relentless pursuit for that ideal is only going to drown you.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Everyone seemed pretty at ease on the helicopter. You were the only one on edge.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Heheh... We can totally steal the show if we just make an effort.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:That's not the point. We have absolutely no room for failure this time...
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:But isn't it odd for a PMC to be put in charge of dealing with something as serious as Yellowcake? +What about the Military?
Glock17(0);IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:According to the top brass, "It serves no purpose to involve the Military without presenting actual evidence." +After all, it's only our conjecture that Sangvis Ferri are in possession of Yellowcake.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>;IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Isn't the footage of their container enough evidence?
Glock17(0);IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:They said that could be anything... +In any case, we can't simply sit here and wait for a crisis to happen.
Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Sigh. Those up there won't ever understand the kind of crap we have to go through...
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:The world's grim enough as is.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Hmph... Who cares. This is the perfect opportunity for us T-Dolls to shine! +Radiation, poison gas, Collapse Fluid - we can brave them all and remain steadfast. We were made for this, don't you think?
SSG69(0);Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Just how much do you want to kill your audience...?
SSG69(0);AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:May I have a word in private, SSG?
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Huh? Hold on. I was just kidding... As if I'd actually gas myself and walk on stage...
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Where are you going?
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏1>:I'll make good use of the additional authorization you've given me.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>:SSG, this outpost isn't far from where you were destroyed last time.
SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Eh? So we chased after the convoy all the way here...? +No, wait... this hardly counts as "not far"!
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏1>:That doesn't matter. There's something I need you to do.
()||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>0.6</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Click.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>46</BIN>:Miss IWS... we're onto something. +We've detected faint traces of radiation residue. The convoy should be up ahead.
