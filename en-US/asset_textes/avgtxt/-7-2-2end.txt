SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:M4A1, I have rendezvoused with AAT. +We are now heading in to crack the transmission device.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:I modularized the cracking procedure left behind by P08 while I was on standby. +We can do it much faster this time!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Then go ahead. And please assess your surroundings carefully before you proceed.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Pas de problème. I've already done that while I was waiting. +There are no explosives around this outpost.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:You know why that won't be necessary?
格里芬人形们()<Speaker>Griffin T-Dolls</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...?!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:A broadcast...? +Who's that?! SASS, find out where the voice is coming from!
SuperSASS()<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||:It's not...from anywhere near...
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Then there's a chance we can make it out...?
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I don't need to be around...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:This...sounds like Architect! +Isn't she...?

M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:SASS... AAT52... +Answer me!
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Heheheheh...
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! +This is it... This is exactly what I'm after!!
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Architect... Why...? +Haven't you surrendered?!
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Surrendered?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BIN>50</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I didn't know my emotion module is so good I managed to fool you all so easily! +I only surrendered with Mastermind's permission, duh. +Then I've been biding my time...waiting for the moment when you let down your guard... +Do you know how long I've been waiting for this, Griffins?!
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>15</BIN>:And this...THIS is the moment... +I can finally return to the Sangvis camp and blow things up to my heart's content!
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:You... +Why are you doing this?! What exactly are you after?!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:Huh? You still don't get it? Just how stupid can you be... +I'm after the Sangvis AI core you just got your hands on, obviously!

BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Sangvis commander for this battle...? +That's right, the battle tonight is its debut after its awakening! +And my job is to assist it in its operation. +Now don't be sad. It isn't a real battlefield if no one gets blown to smithereens. +Behold. These two burned pieces of junk is merely the beginning. We have something even worse in store for you!
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Feel free to proceed with your operation however you want. The result will be the same... +Or you can come directly to me. I might just show a bit of mercy? +HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
