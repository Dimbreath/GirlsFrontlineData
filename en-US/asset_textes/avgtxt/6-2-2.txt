AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hey! Hey, AR Team! I'm over here!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Relax, Galil. You are safe now.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Phew... Thanks a bunch. A few more minutes and Sangvis would've got me.
AR(0);M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Of all the places you could call for help, you just had to pick an open battlefield full of Sangvis forces...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;M16(3)||:Well... Communication with Griffin is jammed where we got ambushed.+I ran for ages before I finally found somewhere with signal. It's not like I was spoiled for choice, you know.
AR(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Can you explain what exactly happened?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:When we were investigating the base where AR-15 had stayed, Negev noticed a Sangvis Ringleader hiding in ambush.+She gestured for me to slip out and call for help while the enemy was still busy deploying her forces.+I only realized there was a signal jam when I was running out. God knows what's going on over there now...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:What should we do, M4? We can't fight off a Ringleader in Sangvis territory on our own.+But we probably don't have time to retreat and ask the commander for help, right?
M16(3);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...We split up.+M16, contact the commander and guide the troops in aiding us.+Galil, take me and SOP-II to the base. We will stir up their forces from the rear and draw some fire away from Negev.
