()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Was that all of them?
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:No new enemies confirmed!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pinocchio can't have gone far. Go upstairs and see if you can find her! +I'll drive the car over. We might just be able to catch up!
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:"Her"?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pinocchio is a girl in a purple dress; she should be pretty easy to spot!
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:R-right!
()||:It's not like we can't deal with the ragtag bandits from the Five Republics, but if Ceno runs away, the whole story will be rewritten and I'll have no idea where to find her next. +Whether her memory has been altered or not, the priority right now is to get in touch with her. +I run as fast as I can to the car that I have hidden beforehand and reverse it out of the garage. +Triela also catches up and jumps in while the car is on the move.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Have you got her?
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:She hasn't got very far! +I'll give you directions as you drive! +Signore Hillshire! +I see her! Keep up this speed; she won't be able to get away!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:!!!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Watch out, she's going to shoot!
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Ceno anticipates Triela's intention. She turns around, stands her ground, and fires a shot straight at us. +I swerve right away; the round hits a traffic sign next to the car.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏>:Duck!!!
()||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Ceno quickly ejects the spent casing and and fires again...
()||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:This round hits the car on the left tire. The car instantly loses control and starts spinning.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:We slam right into a fire hydrant on the pavement and I end up getting stuck behind the inflated airbag that came bursting out upon collision. +I try to push it away, but the impact must've caused the airbag modules to malfunction and they aren't deflating as they should.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<火花>:Triela... Triela!
()<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:...
()||:Triela gives no response in the passenger's seat. She's also constrained by the airbag and seems to be unconscious. +I desperately try to shove the airbag out of my way, but I can't muster my strength probably due to shock.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I failed... I didn't expect to be beaten by my own Doll in the Vita.
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, are you alright?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Rookie mistake... I forgot how easy it must be for Ceno to hit such a big target, even if it was in motion.
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:I won't allow anyone to hurt Signore Giuseppe, not even in a Vita... +Give me a minute, Signore Giuseppe!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What are you doing?
()||:Henrietta doesn't answer. What is she going to do? +She shouldn't be able to interfere with the Vita from outside; it's already stretching it a bit for me to hear her. +I strain my neck to take in my surroundings. The street is filled with screams as people flee the scene in terror. Sirens of police cars can also be heard from the distance. +I draw my combat knife and pierce the airbags to give myself more room to move. +The door next to the driver's seat is jammed so I try to dislodge it with my shoulder. +Through the windscreen, I can see Pinocchio walking towards the badly damaged car with her rifle aimed at me.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ceno... Have you fully become Pinocchio?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I am Pinocchio, but at the same time, I am not.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm having trouble telling which is a lie...
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Both statements are true.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ceno's rifle is pointed at my head. She could blow out my brains whenever she wants, but she seems to be hesitating.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_13</BGM>:Who are you? Why do you feel familiar...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So she hasn't forgotten everything?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Com...mander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you remember me?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:Where am I...? +Why am I...
()||<震屏3>:As Ceno falters, I give the car door another ram, then it becomes unjammed with a loud crack and I fall out onto the ground.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Whoa! Ow, ow, ow...
()||:Ceno aims her rifle at me again nervously.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:My head...hurts... +I remember being in S.A.T.8's room...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ceno, keep calm and put down your weapon first.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:No... Don't come any closer!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I won't hurt you. Can't we just talk?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:I...don't remember what happened.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can't lie to me, Ceno. +I can always tell when you're lying.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:...
()||:Something is affecting Ceno. It looks as if someone was trying to wrench her mind out of her body. +She slings her rifle over her shoulder and runs off in the other direction.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ceno, wait!
()||<黑点2><BIN>265</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_36</BGM>:
()||:The change in Ceno's memory must have been Henrietta's doing. +My body is still aching, but I can't afford to let Ceno get away. +I take off my cumbersome coat and sprint after Ceno.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta, can you hear me?
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What happened to you?
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Signore Giuseppe, but I need a rest.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta?
()||:... +No answer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So it was really her? +Kalin, are you there?

NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's wrong?</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Someone interfered with the Vita from the outside by force and altered the pre-established script.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If Pinocchio realizes that she isn't Pinocchio, the logic in the story will become inconsistent and the Vita will collapse in on itself!</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What happens if it collapses?</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you don't come out soon, there won't be an exit once it falls apart, and you're all going to be trapped in there for good!</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What? But didn't you say these Vitas aren't susceptible to external influences?</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Technically, you can modify a Vita from the outside if you don't care about the consequences...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But if this Vita operates on the same principle as Rico's, then the events are being simulated using Ceno's neural cloud.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Doing something so reckless to an operating neural cloud could cause a meltdown in the worst case!</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Crap...</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Rico's Vita also showed signs of having been tampered with, and Henrietta has been acting pretty weird.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Commander, do you think...</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Let's not make any assumptions yet.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Is there a way that can speed up our progress and help us reach the ending faster?</color>

NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Any suggestions?</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you can somehow fulfill the condition for the story to end without going through all that, I might be able to find a way to get you out sooner.</color>

NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I feel a bit sorry for her, but that's probably the quickest way.</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Will this affect her in any way?</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Not physically; it's a virtual world, after all. But I can't guarantee she won't bear a grudge against you for that.</color>

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just kidding. Once she recovers her memory, I'll explain everything to her, so just bring that story to an end already.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You make it sound so easy...</color>
()||:I watch helplessly as Ceno gets farther and farther away.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<震屏3>:There's no way I can catch up to her!
()||:Even if we're in a Vita, a Doll is still a Doll, and Ceno is still a lot stronger than I am. +Even running at full speed, I have no hope of closing the gap between us, and I can only watch as her figure shrinks smaller and smaller.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:Signore Hillshire!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Triela?!
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Triela drives the damaged car and stops next to me.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Sorry for getting knocked out for a while. Are you coming?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Leave me! Catch up to Pinocchio and kill her!
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:What? Aren't we supposed to capture her alive?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We don't have the luxury! Can do you it?!
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_12</BGM>:If that's your order...!
()||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:Triela stomps on the gas and accelerates toward Ceno...
()||<震屏3><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:But the latter dodges nimbly aside and fires at the driver's seat, blowing a massive hole in the car window.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:Triela!
()||:The swerving car begins to tilt. Ceno lowers her weapon and starts running again. Just as the car is about to roll past Ceno...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>0,10</黑屏1>:
()||<黑屏2><BIN>264</BIN>:
()<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Failure is unacceptable... I have to beat you!
()||:Triela has already hopped into the passenger's seat. She braces herself as much as she can against the shaking car window, then fires at Ceno at point-blank range.
()<Speaker>Carcano M91/38</Speaker>||:!!!
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1><白屏1>:
()||<白屏2><关闭火花><BIN>183</BIN>:The scene fades to white at the sound of the gunshot. I hope Ceno won't blame me for this once we get back. +Triela slips back onto the driver's seat and brings the car to a stop.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Signore Hillshire! +I did it! Won't you praise me?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well done, Triela. +Now it's time to leave.
Triela(0)<Speaker>Triela</Speaker>||:Leave?
()||<黑屏1>:Triela's figure gradually dissolves into the whiteness in the background. +We didn't manage to say goodbye properly, but at least we've all made it out safely.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:That's it? That's the end of this story...?
()||:Henrietta has reappeared next to me since god-knows-when. +She stares blankly at the dark interior of the building and keep muttering to herself.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:That was a lot less painful than the original ending... +If my ending can also be like that...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta? +Are you okay?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta, there's something I need to ask you... Did you alter Ceno's memory just now? +Was it you who made her remember her past?
()||:Henrietta does not answer. She merely bows her head, as if deep in thought. +After a while, she seems to have reached some kind of conclusion and looks up.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, you're still looking for the last Cyborg, aren't you? +She must be in the next Vita. Why don't we hurry up and continue with the search?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We aren't heading back to the garden first?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:We're running out of time. I'll answer your questions when we're in the last Vita, is that alright?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If you insist...then let's go.
