M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? I was just... +What happened? Where's M16? And that Sangvis biker... Where have they gone?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They escaped.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Then the thing that the Commander asked us to intercept...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It doesn't look quite the same as the picture...but I'm guessing it's a small orb like this one? +It seems we've completed the mission...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Is that so...?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:SOP-II looks around.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:What are you looking for, SOP-II?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:RO... When I was in the middle of the fight, for just an instant, I thought I saw AR-15 and M4... +But it's probably just my imagination...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:But they both looked...different than they used to be. +Haha, I must've been dreaming...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Dolls don't dream, SOP-II.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:Then why...would I think I saw them...?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Because you actually did. +Look over there—
()||<黑点2>:SOP-II looks toward where RO is pointing. +Two familiar figures are walking in her direction through the billowing smoke on the battlefield.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
()||:M4 comes to a halt. She looks back at AR-15.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AR-15 returns her gaze and gives her a determined nod.
()||:Then M4 keeps on walking toward a shell-shocked SOP-II and smiling RO. +Her pace quickens until she breaks into a run. +SOP-II seems to finally realize what's happening. She dashes over to M4 and sweeps her into a bear hug.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:(Sobs) Is this...is this real? +M4...is that really you? Am I really not dreaming?
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's right, it's me... +SOP-II...and RO... +I'm so glad you're both alright...
()||:SOP-II holds M4 tightly for a while, then she looks up.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And... AR-15... Is that actually you? +Didn't you...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I was fully prepared to die, but I didn't get my wish. +So I came back...to the same battlefield that you're also fighting on.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:AR-15...AR-15! (Massive sobbing)
()||:SOP-II throws herself at AR-15, almost knocking her off balance.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:What's this all of a sudden... +Jeez, you're always such a baby...
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Just cut her some slack on this occasion, 15.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Seriously, what am I going to do with you? +SOP-II, stop crying. +We finally meet again, you should be smiling.
()||:AR-15 returns SOP-II's embrace and pats her on the head a bit helplessly.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I...I'm just so happy...! (Uncontrollable sobbing)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:She deserves to cry herself out today.
()||<黑屏1>:M4 furtively wipes the corner of her eye with the back of her hand and watches her friends with a smile.
M4A1()||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:After a long battle, the AR Team...is reunited at last. +You're the only left, M16... +When will you finally come back to our side?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Near the safe house.
()||:In the city of Belgrade, the commotion has gradually died down since the white units became paralyzed. +Eventually the last intermittent gunshots disappear altogether, leaving the sun to sink slowly down the hill in a peaceful twilight.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:All that strife over the Pike Node... +Was it really worth it?
()||<黑屏1>:Ange looks into the distant sky. The storms and lighting are nowhere to be seen. +All that's left up there is a heavy layer of clouds - as if nothing has ever happened.
()||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:... +......
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>4</BIN><Night>:At Griffin's temporary camp. +M4 walks up to the truck where the Pike Node is stored. Two Griffin Dolls are standing guard next to it.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are you injured?
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:Just a little, nothing serious... +U-Um...you're the legendary elite T-Doll, M4A1, aren't you?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Yeah.
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Haha, you really do have the looks of an elite.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Aren't you going to get yourselves patched up?
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:We just received orders from Miss RO to guard this truck.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I think you should finish your repairs first. That way you can perform better in your sentry duties.
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I'd like that too. This arm isn't working properly. +But we can't just abandon our posts...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I can take over for a while.
HS2000(0)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:B-but this is our mission... +We can't trouble you with this...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It is not wise for you to delay your maintenance. +It's alright, I'll guard the truck in your place.
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Right, you have a point. Then we'll go for our repairs now. +Sorry for the trouble, M4A1. We'll be right back!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The two Griffin Dolls take their leave.
Clear Voice()||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:They've gone. I will make sure we aren't disturbed in the next few minutes. +Now, let's establish a connection with the Pike Node.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's it? I just have to plug myself to this piece of metal?
Clear Voice()||<白屏1>:Leave it to me.
()||<白屏2><BIN>9</BIN><白屏1>:The second she accesses the Node, M4 feels as if she's been sucked into a black hole. +The world turns into a void in an instant, then...
()||<BIN>142</BIN><白屏2>:Lots of glittering shards start tumbling out from within the depths of the black hole. +Among these bubbles of memories, a few images stand out—
()||:—Several coordinates on the world map. +—A Relic site being excavated. +—Space. +—A satellite. +—The core of the satellite. +—A blinking signal.
M4A1()||:This is...
Clear Voice()||:My past, M4.
M4A1()||:Who exactly are you...?
Clear Voice()||:I don't know either... I only have a feeling... +That the object known to humans as the "Pike" Node is part of me. +The map and the coordinates you just saw are the locations of the remaining Nodes. +This particular one has already been emptied. If I can connect to more of them... +Help me retrieve those lost Nodes, M4.
M4A1()||:Why should I?
Clear Voice()||:I can vaguely sense your past... Remember the dream you had? Remember the girl in that garden?
M4A1()||:That was my past?
Clear Voice()||:It isn't too clear, but I believe we can find some answers in our pasts. + If I can find out more about myself, perhaps I'll be able to unleash more power to help you.
M4A1()||:...Is that so?
Clear Voice()||:You may reject me all you want, but you also know what it is that you truly want, deep down in your heart. +You're not like the rest of them, M4. +You can only have a future...if you own up to your past.
M4A1()||:My future...?
Clear Voice()||<黑屏1>:(She barely noticed the massive signal load when connecting to the core... She really is the chosen one.)
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>85</BIN>:...In the safe house.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...And that's a complete account of what has transpired. +In a nutshell... +M4A1 regrouped with AR-15 and successfully retrieved the core of the Pike Node... +...left behind by M16, who has fled the scene with the remaining Sangvis forces. +Judge, who was engaged in battle with Griffin, also retreated following M16's departure.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Sangvis Ferri just abandoned the core...? That smells a bit fishy. +What's the current status of the Node?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I just received a report from AR-15. +She and M4A1, along with the Griffin Commander's remaining forces, are guarding it.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I see... +So they've deviated from the initial plan. Then we've got to destroy the core now.

NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:I refuse. +According to the original plan, the Pike Node cannot fall into the hands of either side. +It has to be destroyed.

NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:When have we ever been happy about the things we did? +Just bear with it for now... +Set off with AN-94 and arrange for the transfer of the Pike Node with Griffin. +K will inform the Commander of the situation beforehand.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood. We're leaving now.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:They're keeping the Pike Node... What on earth is Statesec up to? +Something just feels off...about this whole thing and its timing. +Still...
