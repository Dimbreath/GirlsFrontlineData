()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +About 40 days after the operation in Area S05... +The AR Team is on an aircraft returning from a visit to M4A1...
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M16... +Hey, M16.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... +What?
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4A1... +What in the world happened to her...?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well... +(Sighs)
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BIN>44</BIN><黑屏2>:According to Persica, her neural cloud is damaged and her Imprint severed... +Even though the neural cloud has now been repaired, the Imprint link still needs to be re-established. Until then, she won't even be able to hold a weapon properly...
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:How could that be... I've never heard of such things...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Well... Don't despair yet. +As the tech provider for T-Dolls, I'm sure 16Lab will be able to get M4 back to how she was. +What we need to do for now...is to get back into top form ourselves and wait for her to come back...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You're right... Let's take a good rest once we're back at the base and wait for our next assignment.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I hope it's gonna be a full-scale counterattack. It's been ages since my last proper fight - I'm itching for a good one.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humph. Didn't you tear some Sangvis mobs to shreds just days ago...?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I have no memory of that, so it doesn't count. +I'm gonna remember everything clearly next time!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Click.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Tsk...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What is it, M16?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:A transmission from Helian. +An urgent one at that... +RO, you'd better...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:(Nods)
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:M16, are you guys still on the aircraft?!
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Uh, yeah...+ETA in three hours...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Change your course immediately according to Plan C! +Area S03, where you're flying over right now, has suddenly come under the attack of numerous Jupiter cannons! +A freighter plane was destroyed in the area just three minutes ago! You must find a way to steer clear of that airspace, do you copy?!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Got it! Adjusting the course right now! We'll be...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hey! What happened?!
M4 SOPMOD ()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD </Speaker>||:We're hit!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Dammit! +Miss Helian! Do you copy?! The rudder of our plane got scraped by a shell! +I've already sent out a distress signal. Please mount a rescue immediately, Miss Helian!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk, comms are down. We're losing altitude! +Hold on tight! Don't let go!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:... +......
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:M16. +Wake up, M16.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:M4? +Is that you? +How come you're here?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is that strange? +Open your eyes and look at me...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>Rope</SE1>:Haven't you...been asking to see me?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...?!
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN>:...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M16? Are you okay?
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:... +I'm...fine... +Did you kill these Sangvis units for me?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Just mobs attracted by the noise. Piece of cake. +Is your neural cloud stable? Just now you looked a bit...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Phew... +Thanks, SOP II. I'm okay.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You sure, M16?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:(Stands up) Positive. +What's our status?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Not good. I'm afraid we've crashed into the heart of Sangvis territory. +We'd better leave this place as soon as possible before we're detected.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:True. You have full command, RO.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But...I can't compare with M4 in terms of experience in dealing with emergencies...
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Don't worry. You have our experience to work with. Now get us outta here!!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Understood. Please lend me your strength. +We only have one single objective - leave this place safely. +We can't do this on our own. I'll need you to get in touch with Helian and get a rescue plan from her, M16.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:But the weather conditions are terrible right now and the signal isn't too stable. +We have to find a communication outpost first.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Not only is the signal weak, we're also freezing to death, and we're running low on rations... +There's snow everywhere and we can't see a thing...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let's find somewhere with a clearer view first so that I can study the terrain and come up with a plan. +Move carefully. This area has been occupied by S.F. not long ago, and we're on our own...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sure... +Then let's get a move on. It's too cold here. If I don't keep moving, I'm gonna freeze!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Be careful. The terrain is way too steep here. Once we go down, we won't be able to come back up.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hmm... +Should we stay and make sure...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Haha, so it's a slide! +Here I come!!!!!!! (Slides off)
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...The coast seems clear. Let's go.
