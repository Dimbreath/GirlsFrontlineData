How's this for an entrance? +The game's already begun, and while you don't need to worry about first impressions, you still need to put your best foot forward with the players. +Alright, I know you don't quite understand what's going on, so let me explain to you. +The story that's going to unfold will have nothing to do with your memories. +You will be appearing in a bizarre and brand new world, and both the identities of you and your friends and your relationships with them won't be quite the same as you remember. +You will even make a few new friends, namely those Griffin Dolls. +You may end up going on a mysterious adventure together, and you may even end up getting into great danger. +But like I said before, 90% of life lies in how you react to it! +So what is the bright side of this? I'm not sure myself. Perhaps it'll fall into your lap as long as you maintain your focus? +Good luck, Julianne and Jo.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,10</黑屏1>:...And good luck to this world.

MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MP446(0)||:It's too dark here, and it's all ruins. I wonder what happened here in the past...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Ahhhh, our tour guide already said that nobody's been here for a long time. +Besides, you have nothing to worry about with me here-

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:...MP-446 turns on the flashlight with trembling fingers.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><白屏2>:What the heck, you scared the crap out of me. They're just the bones of the natives. I thought it'd be the wreckage of a S.F. Dinergate again.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MP446(0)||:Viking... +The truth is, you're actually scared of the dark too...am I right?
MP5(0);MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker><Shake>||:A-As if! How could anyone live in Griffin City if they were scared of the dark? +I'm...I'm just worried that I might not have enough power. After all, I was only at 79% charge when we set out... +In any case, I'm not afraid of being caught and made to push sand around as long as I can escape that boring protest.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MP446(0)||:We should have gone somewhere safer, like the Statue of Liberty or the Pyramids...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Tch, what's so interesting about those hunks of rocks? The Pyramids don't even have electricity! +Just hang on for a bit more, Gr MP5. This is an adventure that only we can complete! +And I trust in our tour guide; she's one of the coolest natives of Griffin City!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Thank you, though I'd prefer to be called an explorer. +Ladies, I'm certain the way ahead is very safe. Nobody's come this way for at least three years.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Three years... As I thought, it was all since "that time"...
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Yes, my adorable little Dolls. +If you had subscribed to "The Augmented Eye", you would have seen all kinds of nonsense about the end of the world, and what lies ahead of you is the little bit of truth that they contained.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Yeah, yeah, I'm looking forward to it! I'm going to scan all of this afterwards and tell all my friends in Griffin City!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I'm just a little afraid that S.F. might actually show up here. I've seen the martial law imposed over the surrounding areas…
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I think you wouldn't even be able to find them if you wanted to. Alright, you two, hang on a bit, I'm firing up the authentication system.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:...Beep. +The electronic door opens.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑点2>:You can actually authenticate without an electronic module?
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I know Dolls don't take history lessons on the natives, so allow me to remind you that before the end of human civilization, our kind possessed superior security access.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... I still don't understand the phrase "human civilization". It sounds just like..."meat-eating giraffe" to me...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:That's why I prefer to stick with how The Augmented Eye calls it.+Humans were the slaves of an alien civilization, and the only purpose for their existence was to create all kinds of wonders upon this spherical water garden for their masters, as well as us.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:The only section of The Augmented Eye worth reading now is the one about prehistoric animals. +The topic about cougars last week covered the difficulties of life for the older women among the natives. It was pretty interesting. +Ah, sorry, you don't like us addressing you as a "native", do you, Miss Tour Guide?
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why would I mind? It's the truth.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:A lot of the original residents don't like being called that, because in the past, humans burned the homes of the natives here and stole their land.
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Those are the actions of civilized men. Fortunately, human civilization has long since died out. +However, if you want to go somewhere else next time and want to contact me, you might do well to remember my name. Look.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Uh...this isn't your tour guide pass, is it?
Dana(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Of course not, it's a medal from my wrestling days.

MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Hehe, I told you, didn't I? She's the coolest native of Griffin City!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Dana will do. The rest is just my job code. Unlike you guys, I don't make the weapon I wield a part of my name. +Alright, we're almost there!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点2>:Look closely, you two! What you're about to see is the final miracle of human civilization- +The— Earth— Computer—! +—Well, what's left of it.

MP5(0);MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:This place is really beat up. What on earth happened here? All I can see is signs of devastation... +Wait a minute, these scratches...they were left by S.F.!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MP446(0)||:What? +Ah! Wait, that electronic debris! It's S.F. wreckage, isn't it!?

MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Shh — By the cables! Over there— +Is that its shadow?

Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:The Core Elevator's on the right! It runs directly from the East Asian continent to Venezuela! I'll find you and settle the rest of the bill and tips later!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...After watching the two Dolls scream as they vanish into the distance, Dana turns around.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:So, who the hell are you guys? +I haven't fought S.F. in a long time. Hopefully I won't have to face too many at once.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Uuuuuurgh-

()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Are you awake?
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Where... am I?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You're on my back, and I'm in the Core Elevator. We just passed the granite layer and we'll be reaching the surface soon.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:What...happened?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Beats me. You crawled out of the ruins of the Earth Computer and scared my two customers away.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Why...can't I move?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:That's because you're out of power. I need to carry you out of here to get some sun.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Er... +Then...who are you...?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Dana Zane, native of Earth, female, aged 17. Today, I'm a tour guide for prehistoric relics.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:17? You look...
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Allow me to rephrase that, my age is 17 plus a number that would make me gouge your neural cloud out to make soup with if you knew it.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Er...then...I have another question... +Who am I?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You don't remember? +Maybe your memory module went into emergency sleep mode because you were low on power. +Once you get a nice big helping of sunshine on the beach, you'll have lots of time to think over it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Ding!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>You have reached the surface of the Northern Hemisphere. Please ensure you have all your personal belongings and weapons.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>187</BIN><黑点2>:... +Dana puts down the Doll on her back.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Why is there sand everywhere?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:It's a long story. Do you remember anything now?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:...
SuperShorty(0)<Grey>;Dana(0)<Grey>||:
()||:...Super-Shorty grabs a handful of sand from the ground, then watches it slip through her fingers.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:It's not like sand... +What is this...
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hey, darling, who are you? Why were you hiding in the Earth Computer room?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I... +I still can't remember anything.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Right. Looks like you've laid there for three years and the environment ate away at your neural cloud. +But no need to worry, I'll give you an answer. You should be Super-Shorty.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:...What? +D-Don't call me short!
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Ah, sorry, I was talking about your name - Super-Shorty. +I took a look at the weapon in your hands, the one which you were holding onto all this while. Aren't all Griffin Dolls named after weapons?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:Perhaps... I don't like this name very much, but at the very least, this weapon feels...very familiar.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:That was the purpose for your creation. Do you remember?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I...yes, I do remember. +I'm a Griffin Doll, and everyone addressed us by the name of our weapon. +Therefore, my name is Super-Shorty. I am a Tactical Doll made to protect humanity.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Protect humanity? I'm guessing your memories regressed all the way back to your factory default.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Just then, the sound of an engine roaring in the distance is heard.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Something's coming.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:It's the sound of the White Knight mechanized units. We can't stay around here, come with me.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:Who are the White Knights?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:They're Griffin City's police force. They include Dolls and humans among them, but most of them are made of emotionless machines.+Considering the present state of the world, it's easier to think of them as the "world police".
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:Then why do we have to run?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You really are a good girl, aren't you? +Dolls that take in too much sunshine become lazy and no longer wish to return to Griffin City to partake in entertainment activities. They grow to hate social interactions, and their neural clouds close themselves off from everyone. +Therefore, the White Knights periodically search this stretch of the desert, and if your battery charge is greater than 80%, then I'm terribly sorry, you'll have to burn it off through forced labor.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I'm not interested in entertainment. Don't tell me that's illegal too?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Those are the rules set by the Prime Minister. Griffin City doesn't need people who can't face the end of the world with a smile.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:Then what should we do? +I may have broken the law without knowing it, but that doesn't mean I can just run off, can I?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Sorry, but you don't get to make the call.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:What—
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<震屏>:Eh!?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Dana scoops up Super-Shorty and dumps her into a nearby car.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hold on, shorty. I'm going to show you around and get you familiar with this world while we avoid those White Knights.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:We're breaking the law, Miss Dana Zane! +Humanity won't condone a Doll breaking the law, apart from you!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We're just logically evading the illogical parts of this world. +Not to mention, most of humanity won't mind either, as they're all extinct anyway.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>188</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:…Ten minutes later, Dana's car races over the desert, carrying Super-Shorty.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_all_systems_go</BGM>:Hey. How are you feeling now, shorty?
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Don't call me shorty! +Honestly...did you just say humanity is extinct?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>)||:Most of us are gone, along with our civilization.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I don't get it...what happened?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:It's not important. It already happened a few centuries ago. +According to the history that the Dolls voted on, it was in the year 3029. A group of higher-ups in the environmentalist movement decided to categorize herbivore animals as citizens... +After that, several elephants transmitted an experimental virus to mankind in a religious carnival, and they mutated...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Human civilization...was destroyed by elephants?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:No, I heard that the human rights organizations back then refused to cleanse the zombie infectees that were born from the virus, and even insisted on giving them voting rights because they were a majority. +And then five years later, during a joint military exercise, the First Lady of the opposition wore perfume that the zombies were allergic to, and then there was a world war, and then... +(Shrugs) Who knows? We don't even know which year was 3029.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I don't know what to say, Miss Dana. I'm terribly sorry.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Save it. Did we ever tried to comfort the mammoths or the glyptodonts? —Hell no. We even drove the dodos to extinction with our own hands. +Laugh if you want. It's your era now.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>190</BIN>:I won't laugh. I'm not a human like you! +It's just that I'm not sure how much history I've missed... +Weren't humans supposed to be the ruling lifeforms of Earth? You used to be able to do whatever you wanted.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Not anymore. Of the 300,000 users currently registered in Griffin City, humans only make up about 1% of them. +We're nothing more than the so-called natives. We're no longer the owners of this land.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:What about the remaining 99%?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:They're Griffin Dolls like you. They're everywhere. There's also a few androids, like the Lilim and whatnot.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:How could Griffin Dolls have survived so long with such poor interaction efficiency? +We can't even organize a picnic without humans.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Many years ago, the Earth Computer appointed a Lilim as the Prime Minister in order to improve the dull living environment. The reasoning being that Lilims have superior processors than Dolls and possess a thought capability comparable to human beings. +In truth, she did keep our city running, but only with regard to entertainment activities. She left everything else to the White Knights. +At first, everyone felt that this was pretty good, because the White Knights were more than enough to ensure security, so everyone didn't need to do much more than get drunk out of their minds in Griffin City every day. +But after the Earth Computer went missing, a lot of terrible things happened and the Prime Minister didn't have any constructive plans to rectify the situation...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:The Earth Computer?
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Yup. Before my great-great-great-great-great-to-the-nth-power ancestors offed themselves, they built the Earth Computer. +It was used to manage and carry out the various processes of Earth...such as its magnetic field, the ocean currents, the day and night cycle, and of course, the weather.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>191</BIN>:That sounds insane... Logically speaking, that thing should have destroyed the world by now.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Perhaps. But after they invented that computer, the entire Earth was under the full control of mankind. +They could make it sunny if they wanted, make it rain if they wanted, they could go to Sagittarius to watch a meteor shower and come back if they wanted. It was trivial for them. +Even after our civilization went extinct, the Earth Computer could continue operating on its own, so the Dolls of Griffin City have ruled Earth for a very long time.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:But if that were the case, then why are there deserts everywhere on the surface? I don't see...anything else.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I should be asking you that question, but unfortunately you've lost your memories. +The Earth Computer went missing three years ago. It was supposed to be in the place where I found you ten minutes ago. And then a whole mess of problems happened to Earth.+For starters, Earth couldn't move anymore, both in its orbit and its own natural rotation. All it could do was stay still in space like a balloon stuck against the ceiling, haha.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>190</BIN>:How could you laugh about this... Still, shouldn't Earth have been doomed a long time ago? +Forget it, my knowledge base doesn't seem too applicable here...
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Who cares? We survived, at the very least, but that was only the beginning of our problems. +The next day, the sky started to rain sand, at 8 AM on the 10th of every month, over the Northern Hemisphere. Then the sands spread all over the globe. +Over these three years, 90% of Earth's surface became covered in sand. +Even for the Dolls the world became inhospitable, so all they could do was pop out to get some sun every now and then. Sometimes they would get buried by the sand rains, so they'd have to ask the Valkyries to dig them out.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>188</BIN>:But you don't look worried at all. If this keeps up, it really will be the end of the world.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:It's not like we can do anything about it. Besides, it'll take a few more years before the Southern Hemisphere is completely buried, and nobody's trying to find a solution; they're all too busy enjoying the entertainment. +The Dolls now spend their days partying in Griffin City on the Southern Hemisphere, then charging themselves in the sun in the deserts of the Northern Hemisphere, and the Dolls with too much battery charge are tasked with pushing the sand into the sea.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hmph. If I were Prime Minister, I'd think of some way to solve this problem.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I'm sure there are people that think the same way as you do. After all, there are hundreds of thousands of thinkers in this world that haven't been buried by the sands yet. +However, the sand's been piling up outside Griffin City over the past few months, and people have started to protest our Prime Minister's lack of action.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:It's too late now. They shouldn't have entrusted their destinies to a computer and an entertainment robot. +It's no wonder I didn't see anyone in the desert...
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You won't find anyone out here except the White Knights, but— +Wait... +Do you hear the sound of engines?
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:To our 7.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...There's more than one sound, and from different models.
