()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏2>:The two Dolls sprint through the tunnel.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:What's your current status?
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Some minor damage; won't be a problem for the moment. +Why did you come back?
AN94(5);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:Leaving on your own would've been the best solution. +Yet you doubled back, risking your own life and using up all our explosives - why?
AN94(5);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I don't know why, I just thought that was the right thing to do.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:You should know that's not good enough of a reason, AR-15. +You are one-of-a-kind, while I can create backups of myself. Your survival takes priority.
AN94(5);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Why ask me such questions? +You should know better than me.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:I don't understand. +I just can't figure out your rationale, which is why I have to ask. +As a senior, you are more experienced than me...
AN94(5);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I told you to stop calling me that...
AN94(5);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AR-15 rubs her temples as if the word gives her a headache.
AN94(5);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Something's value is determined by its demand. You and AK-12 have carried out more orders from Ange than me, so you meet her demand. +Therefore, from the perspective of meeting Ange's demand, you're more valuable than me. +Even you have to admit that, right? +No, you should admit it especially because you're so driven by logic.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:Is that your reason...? +But...
AN94(4);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If you got destroyed back there, putting aside the question about whether Ange has a spare body of the same quality ready for you, it'd take a long time just to download your backup. +The situation is so urgent we simply don't have the luxury of waiting for you to reinstall yourself and get used to a new body.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||:However, this mission can be accomplished even without me.
AN94(4);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:There's a limit to how modest one can be, AN-94. +Don't deny your worth.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Shake>;AR15Mod(2)||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Sorry. But...AR-15, you and M4A1— no...the entire AR Team are the most tailored to Ange's use. +No matter how capable I look, I'm still just a supplementary tool. +All kinds of reasoning suggest that you should prioritize your own safety and I, too, will always choose to save you over myself.
AN94(4);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What do you mean?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AR15Mod(2)||<黑屏1>:Nothing. +The exit is just ahead, correct? +Then we had better leave this place quickly.
