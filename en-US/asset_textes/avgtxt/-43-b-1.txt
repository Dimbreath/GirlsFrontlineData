()||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:... +In the Griffin base.
()<Speaker>Broadcast</Speaker>||:Sign-ups for "The Division" Group Tournament are live! Places are limited, so join fast—!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
()||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:As VSK-94 steps into the corridor, she is suddenly body-blocked by three Dolls.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hey...think that's real?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Looks like the real deal... Tut tut tut.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hm, it's not just the clothes... Look at her face. That face. Isn't it super familiar?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Excuse me, seniors? +May I know what you're talking about?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Whoa! She's alive!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Huh?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:How drunk are you, anyway? Of course she's alive, did you think someone else moved her here?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, I wanna follow this line of questioning. Are Dolls really alive?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Um, if you'll excuse me.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hey wait wait wait! +Don't go so soon, rookie... Come, we want to get to know you a little better...
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I remember you. You must be Miss A-91, if I'm not mistaken.+I'm not opposed to joining your conversation...+But it seems you simply wish to make fun of me.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:No no no, we're not making fun of you. Rather, we have a great deal of respect for you! Sort of.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Da, da.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...I don't get it. +Why do you say that?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Now where should we begin...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ahaha, I won't beat around the bush, then, rookie. +You used to be a gop, right?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:A what?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:A COP! A police officer! +Ignore her, she's as drunk as a skunk.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Da, I used to serve with the police, and for a long time too. +What about it?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hah! Well, not to toot our own horn, but whenever we go out on missions, we almost always end up getting the cops... I mean, police up our asses.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Da! Thassright! Never thought there'd be a day when we'd have a gop...uh, a cop as a colleague.+So we got a man on the inside now, right? No need to fear those cops... I mean, police anymore!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hehe... We'll show them the next time we meet.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I returned my badge before I came here. What I'm wearing now is just a memento.+I no longer have any legal authority.+In addition, your reasons for being pursued and arrested are rather apparent as it is.+Have you considered that you might have brought it upon yourselves?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Haha, you got it! Man, is my face red!+Aw, forget it! Come come come, have a drink or two with us!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I am currently on duty.+Also, forgive my bluntness, but I do not wish to drink with you.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Ehhhh? But why?! Give us a reason!+We won't let you go until you make it convincing!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Would you like me to go by chronological or alphabetical order?
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Ahhhh, just come with us! The Commander should have told you that you need to get along with your colleagues, right?+This is just being polite, podruga!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Why do Dolls still have to comply with the rules of corporate politeness...? Wait, please don't drag me along, I can walk on my own.
()||<黑点1>:
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2>:Oi~ Are you looking down on your seniors? You stick-in-the-mud... (hic) Now drink!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... Normally, I don't have a problem with drinking.+But after seeing the three of you, I have decided to steer clear of alcohol.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Humph... Look at you, you're totally sloshed and you still have the cheek to tell others to drink. You've disgraced Squad Vodka!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:WHAT? Didn't I say we were Squad Oolong Tea? Don't go around changing things as you like.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:It sounds horrible. What's so good about oolong tea anyway?!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:VODKA tastes awful!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Put that vodka bottle down before you say that!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Also, the two names are nothing alike.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:(Hic) Quit fighting. +Say, you heard about "it"?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:You mean "that"? +Everyone in Griffin knows about "that"!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Oh? So the two of you noticed too?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Da. What do you think?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You're talking about how all the vodka in the base tastes like it's been watered down lately, right? +I noticed that long ago.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Who the hell's talking about that, dumbass?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Well, it's kinda relevant. +Didn't A-91 get drunk and cause a big hoo-ha some time back? +You know, during that pajama party.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Nope, don't remember~
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:(Hic) Yeah, after that, the Commander docked our drinks allowance. +Now we can only buy this crappy booze. Of course it tastes watered down.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Ahhh, money, money would be nice. +Oh... I see now. That's why you brought it up. +You want that prize money, right?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Sounds great, right? +It's ten million, y'know?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Ten million...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Ten million, think about it. How many bottles of high-end vodka would that buy?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:...Guh.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:What'll it be? You in or you out?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Vodka... My vodka...! +I'm in!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Alright! Count me in too!
()||:The dorm was noisy before, but suddenly it's gotten even worse.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...+...They won't be able to win if they're THIS drunk, right?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Newbie! You're coming too! +Don't think you can get away!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...You're roping me in as well?
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Of course! You want to drink too, right?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, I'm not really interested.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Aw, don't be like that.
()||:AK-47 suddenly throws her arms around VSK-94's shoulders.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Think about it! This is a group activity, we don't get those often, you know? +And look at you, you're so full of potential, don't you want the Commander to see how great you are?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Besides, you don't want the others to think you're distant, do you? +This is a rare chance for you to get to know the other Dolls while playing a game, you know?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:That actually sounds quite compelling.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's it, then! +Let's go, girls!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Woohoo—!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Vodka, vodka, here I come—!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) +I'm already starting to regret this...
