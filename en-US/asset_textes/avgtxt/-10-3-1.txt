NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:Miss UMP45, I'm about to brief the squad on the operation assigned by Miss Persica. Are you ready?
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm in a bad mood. Be concise.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:As you wish. Miss Persica wants Squad 404 to head deep into the heart of Sangvis territory in Area S15 to retrieve a small drone shot down by Sangvis Ferri. +Since the area is badly contaminated as well as heavily fortified, you're to locate the drone with the help of your new electronic signals. +Through the use of the new electronic warfare module, you can harness the computational capacity of other T-Dolls to boost the efficiency of your analog signals within the Zener Network.
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So that's the purpose of the module we installed... +Did Miss Persica give any detail on the importance of this drone?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Though the drone was shot down, its connection to the network is still stable, so you can locate it with your new module. +Miss Persica mentioned that this particular drone is of vital importance and must be recovered at all costs. +As for why, she didn't say...
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You mean she didn't want to say. Not that I need to know. +I don't like people donating us random weird modules, but the price Persica named is way too high... +So high I don't want to imagine what would happen if I had refused.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Don't worry too much. All that matters is the reward, right?
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't deny it, though I wonder how much I can actually get. +I don't understand why "that person" would take such a big share just to repair some piece of junk... +Well, that's enough grumbling. I bet Persica can't wait to hear about our latest training results?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Yes, but it's more important to her that you can accomplish the mission without undue risks. +So please proceed to the next training soon.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:When it comes to the actual battle, Sangvis Ferri will very likely attempt to destroy the data stored in the drone through the network. +You'll need stronger allies in bigger numbers on your side. Miss Persica knows very well how important this is. +She has enlisted the help of all off-duty T-Dolls under the commander in Area S09 and directed their computational capacity to the signals of Squad 404. With that, you can make use of other echelons in cyberspace.
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That will get us through most obstacles. +Sier, get the other three and connect us to the network. Time to get down to business.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Miss 45... +I just heard about the signal overload...
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +You have an idea about it?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Deele told me it's a mild side effect caused by the signal being too strong... +But theoretically speaking, moving between consciousness levels shouldn't access data in the storage area... +Besides, none of the other members of Squad 404 has this problem, which leads me to believe there's some other cause.
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Specifically?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:Unknown for the moment. I just ran a diagnostic on your hardware and neural cloud. Everything is functioning normally. +Still, there can sometimes be inconceivable conflicts among modules, and judging from current observations, they don't seem to be too detrimental, so I think it's not actually a big problem. +I've already asked Dier to adjust the parameters of your neural cloud, and I'll keep monitoring your electroneuralography.
NPC-Seele(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Conflicting modules... I don't really like the sound of that.
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||<黑屏1>:Don't worry about it for now and let's run another simulation training. +Rest assured that with more data, your performance will definitely be optimized.
