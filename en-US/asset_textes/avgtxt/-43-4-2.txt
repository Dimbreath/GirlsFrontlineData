()||<黑屏2><BIN>288</BIN><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:The sounds of gunfire in the Dark Zone grow more and more intense, but the enemies patrolling the street are not alarmed by it—+They act as their programming dictates - they will only make a move once they "see" their enemies. Therefore, when facing these enemies, whose action priorities are predetermined, the best course of action is to pull the trigger without any hesitation.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:However, 416 feels that there is a big difference when she faces off against Vector once more — that is because the last time she fought Vector, her opponent felt more like an NPC adversary.+That said, her present circumstances give her no time to dwell on the strangeness of this.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bullets sweep across the ground, throwing up a trail of dust clouds and sprays of muddy water—+They race after their sprinting target, until said target slides behind a car by the roadside.
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:As 416 reloads, she sees Vector exposed for a moment between her rounds of shooting, but just as she leans out to take a shot, an HE grenade lands nearby.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Tsk!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:This is the last piece of cover available to 416.+While she manages to evade the damage of the grenade with a dodge roll, she is left completely exposed to Vector's shooting in turn.
HK416Mod(0);Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时点亮>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flash_Bomb_Explosion</SE1>:At this point, both sides are practically within arms' reach. As she leaves her cover, 416 can see Vector in full combat mode, while the weapon in her hands looks like it's been upgraded by the spoils of war.+Even so, 416 manages to find a slim lifeline; there is a suitcase bomb between herself and Vector, its sensor LED flashing. 416 opens fire on it without any hesitation.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Vector(0)||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:For a brief moment, 416 feels herself being struck by multiple bullets, but then the shooting stops almost as abruptly as it began.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Vector(0)||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Her enemy is out of rounds.+Having come to that conclusion, 416's vision begins to turn red. She charges through the smokescreen thrown up by the explosion and points her gun's muzzle squarely between Vector's eyes.
HK416Mod(0);Vector(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Select</SE1>:Similarly, Vector has her sidearm — she was unable to reload her primary weapon in time — out and pointed at 416's left eye.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:The first to act will win, and both sides are on equal footing. Yet neither side pulls their respective triggers — they appear to have seen the same confusion they are feeling mirrored in each other's eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>287</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM><SE1>AVG_The_Division_Flare_Gun</SE1><白屏2>:The brief silence is broken by a screeching noise. A red signal flare climbs into the air above the city's skyline, far in the distance.+It is the landing beacon for the extraction chopper.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:"aaaa" has called for Agent extraction.+9:59:62 until evac chopper arrives.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>A-Agents! Someone's launched the evac signal flare! Please hurry here and meet up ASAP!</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:If you're so worried, you can go yourself. I've got more important things to take care of.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:You're really not going to let it go?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:Whose fault do you think it is, anyway?
Vector(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hey, I don't care if you want to fight all day afterwards, but now is really not the time— Whoa!</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Miss Dima? What's happening on your side?
Vector(0)<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||:Detecting large numbers of hostile signals.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:At a time like this...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Right after ISAC's warning, 416 and Vector both feel their vision distorting almost simultaneously.+Right after that, they hear the quiet sound of metal clinking, and throw themselves away from each other in a reflexive dodge — and the place they had occupied just a moment ago is promptly engulfed in a series of explosions.+The blasts were caused by several HE grenades, coming from the direction of the signal flare. The rogue agents have appeared once more.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Aren't these numbers a bit much?

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)<通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Was it because 45 called the evac chopper?+—Come to think of it, how come your voice is so soft now?

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:A nearby explosion from a grenade interrupts 416's train of thought — the rogue agents have surrounded them.+After finding a hiding place, 416 checks her mag and verifies Vector's position.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:So the enemy is targeting her too?
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I think so...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Wait a minute, what are you up to?</color>
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:416 ignores Dima. She waits for a moment when Vector is being pinned down by the rogue agents before turning and fleeing down an alley.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hey! Don't run off by yourself! Are you going to abandon her?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If you don't work together, both of you will have a hard time dealing with all these enemies by yourselves!</color>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:You're so damn naggy... We might be quarreling, but my partner is still 45. There's no way I'd work with someone from Griffin.+My friend has already called the evac chopper, and the medicine is over there too. +Why should I not meet up with her and waste my time on that madwoman instead?
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>B-but...</color>
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:There seems to be a disturbing change in the way Dima is speaking.+Though 416 doesn't want to describe it that way...+It feels as though Dima has come to life.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>I have higher hopes on the two of you than the other one.</color>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:What?
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The sound of gunfire closes in.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? It-it looks like she's catching up!</color>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Tsk, caught between a rock and a hard place. What a pain. +Get out of my way!
