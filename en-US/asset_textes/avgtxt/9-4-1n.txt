()||:...The sound of crossfire remains in the distance.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Guys, over here! +Put Captain down. We have quick-repair kits here!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Are...are we safe...? +But...but...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Stop trembling, T65. +Yes, we escaped with our lives. It's not that big a deal.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Miss M16 really is okay! +T77, Miss M16 has really returned from behind the fog!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:She's in a much better state than we imagined... +This is great news...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Can you believe it, T77?! It came true!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Please don't hold me so tight...can't breathe. +... +Miss Garand, may I ask a question?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Yes?
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Was the Miss M16 we just saw... +The real deal...or was that an imposter? 
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:What are you talking about, T77? Miss Thompson was covering our escape, wasn't she?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:That Miss M16 is definitely not an imposter. +I've been with you the whole time; I couldn't have applied makeup on anyone. +Besides, our designated star, Miss Thompson...well, there she is.
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...That does seem to be the case. +...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Phew...that feels a lot better. +Is everyone here? +Nobody got lost on the way, I hope?
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Yep, that's everyone. +We can summon the chopper anytime.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Wait, we don't have everyone! +Miss M16 didn't follow us!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I know. +M14, send a message to the Boss.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:...Got it.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:...Huh? +We're...leaving Miss M16 behind on her own? +Why, Miss Thompson?! Why are we abandoning our companion?!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:She must have her own reason for coming here. We can only watch out for ourselves. +You don't have to worry about her; she is, after all, Griffin's toughest veteran.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:But even you said that Judge is a formidable foe... +If something happens to Miss M16 when she's fighting her...
T65(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:If Miss M16 could survive her previous ordeal, she'll be fine this time as well. +Let's go. Miss T91 is still waiting for your good news.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;m1(0)||:She's been waiting for so long... +If we go back just like that...we'll give her nothing but more hope... +And I can do nothing...but wait with her.
T65(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:But this is a hard-earned chance for us to make a safe retreat... If you go back for Miss M16, you'll only end up putting yourself in unnecessary danger. +If you get destroyed...you won't even remember you've seen Miss M16.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;m1(0)||:I... +I've had enough with sitting at the base waiting for so-called good news. +If I had to lose her again, then I'd rather not have reunited with her to begin with! +Either we go home with Miss M16, or we forget everything that happened here!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:...
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss M3, please talk some sense into Miss T65. +At this rate...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:No, I'm gonna kill that midget. +I'm gonna go back and kill her right now.
M4A1(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Huh?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>;m1(0)||:Who does she think she is? She rubs me the wrong way. +Did she get so pompous because I didn't stand up to her? +Also, "grease gun"?!
M4A1(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss M3...what's the matter with you? +You look scary... No...M4 looks scary...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>;m1(0)||:<size=35>Some people flip out when you mention their height. Similarly, this could be M3's berserk button.</size>
T77(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:... +Miss T77...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>;m1(0)||:...
T77(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:... +Alright...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>;m1(0)||:An actual wordless communication of ideas – how rare. +Are you sure you haven't misunderstood anything?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Yes, it's pretty clear what you intend to do...
()||:...Thompson and Garand exchange a glance.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:You guys... Is it because you're so young that you're so unyielding...? +Save it, Garand. Aren't you the same?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:... +...How much time can we buy if I double the length of my report?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:How much time? +Let's agree on the number according to the union's rules.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Captain...?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑点1>:M14, rewrite the message. +Tell the Boss that we're staying out late.
