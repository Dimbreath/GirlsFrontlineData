()||<BIN>97</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Combat over.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:We won, Thunder. +There's neither Sangvis Ferri nor Griffin here. +This world only belongs to the two of us.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><BGM>DJMAX_BELL</BGM>:Do you like such a world, Thunder? +No one hates you anymore, and no one will ever pick on you for having a poker face. +I know how hard it is for you to express your feelings. This must be the world you've been wishing for!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:But I don't want to stay.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Why? +Because I'm not real?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:Because I can't live here. +I know I'm useless...I think too much and I'm not good with words. I'm always two steps behind everyone else. +But I've got to try my best to adapt, not run away.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Do you really mean that, Thunder...? +What's so good about a world like that?!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:Nothing, but that's the only world in which I'll grow... +Until I can catch up with them...950 and my other teammates... +I won't hide in a dream. I won't hide behind 950 or anyone else.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:Because 950 once said that I have to change my own mind. +This adventure has made me realize that I have to do this. I have to be strong for you... +So that no matter what kind of danger arises... 
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Thunder...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:I'm sorry, but that's why I have to wake up, no matter the cost...
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...M950A smiles, and the world before their eyes start crumbling like cracked eggshells.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Well done, Thunder. +You passed the test.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Huh?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:I was going to take you with me. +But it appears that won't be necessary.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...The ground starts collapsing under Thunder's feet.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Ah...it's time to say goodbye...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:...M950A walks closer to Thunder.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>:...M950A gives Thunder a push, and Thunder tumbles into the pure white swirl of emptiness along with the broken pieces of the world.
()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>142</BIN><黑屏2>:Wait, 950! +Don't tell me...!
()||<BIN>142</BIN>:...M950A's voice echoes in the shattered world.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>142</BIN><黑屏1>0.6</黑屏1>:That's right, it's really me... +I'm the real M950A. +It was only for a second, but I did...truly hate myself.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>1</黑屏2>:M950A is exactly that kind of person. +I hate people like that. +I hate...myself for being like this.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...!
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I've given it a lot of thought – what would I be like if I weren't burdened by my duty... +If I didn't have friends, or you... +I'm sorry, Thunder, but the M950A that you believe in...isn't the real me.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:No...that's not true! +The M950A I'm talking to isn't the real you either! Come back, 950!
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:But I've chosen this path. I'm sorry...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:It's been my fault this whole time, Thunder. Everything I lived by...has been a mistake.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:You're not wrong, 950! +Close your mind! El Fail is trying to hack you!
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:What if this is the moment I've been looking forward to? +I'm willing to accept my fate. +Thunder, the life I've been living is a mistake. Everything you know about me is also wrong. +Leave this place and forget about me...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:But you're not wrong, 950!
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...You think so?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:Yes...you're not a mistake...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Say it louder. I like hearing you say that...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:YOU ARE NOT WRONG! +YOU ARE NOT A MISTAKE!
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:...As Thunder bellows, her vision blurs. +...The entire world grows farther and farther away...until she finds herself lying in the Graveyard. +...Silence. Solitude. Emptiness.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:You...are not wrong... +...
