M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:Do not cheer only for yourself, SOP-II. This is the fruit of everyone's labor.
M4A1(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I contributed, Commander! Praise me!
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:(Sighs) Look at you, wagging your tail only at the commander. Is it really so bad when I give orders?
M4A1(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh my, so even M4 gets jealous?+I just find the commander the most dependable.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:Fair enough. Then do your best serving under the commander.
M4A1(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Okay! I'll be good!+I'll do whatever Commander says as long as...I can tear that 'Hunter' to pieces!

M4A1(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:SP721 'Hunter', the Sangvis Ringleader in this area according to AR-15's investigation.

M4A1(0);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:She...drew Hunter away so that I could retreat.+Commander, Hunter is a wily bastard. AR-15 won't last long on her own!

BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:Is that all you've got? I thought you'd at least have something up your sleeve, coming here to die alone.
BOSS-3(0);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:My carelessness has put everyone at risk. If I can somehow make up for my mistake...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:The AR Team is a group of Griffin T-Dolls that can operate independently without human direction, and you are part of it.+You seem so rational you almost come off as ruthless on my record, yet you turn out to be so impulsive.+I had thought we could understand each other. How disappointing...
BOSS-3(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Your intel is too superficial. Perhaps it's time to upgrade your database.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:Sure we will. All the problems will be solved once I get my hands on my prey.
BOSS-3(0);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4A1... Why do you want her so badly?!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:That's not important, AR-15. The point is, you're gonna be the bait that lures M4 here.
BOSS-3(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<黑屏1>:You must pay for your impulsiveness, AR-15.+A true hunter would have chosen to remain silent.
