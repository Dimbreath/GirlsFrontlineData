()||<BIN>55</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：...Some time later, Area S02.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：There. The jamming signal has been eliminated.+We'll now enter Base 0...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Hold on, RO.+I suggest tapping into the Sangvis communication channel just to be safe.+We might be able to acquire important information while we're still undetected.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Hacking into their network might expose our location. I don't recommend this course of action.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：RO, if S.F. has been waiting for us all along, it's total annihilation we're talking about.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...+Fine. I suppose this is necessary.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：Uh...RO, sync the signal to the public encrypted channel.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：These are all merely battle signals, Miss Persica. They won't be useful to you.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：(Sighs) If you won't let me do extra things, then at least let me listen in...+ It'd be nice to save unexpected discoveries for the future.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Do as Persica says, RO. The Commander needs those information too, after all.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：...Understood.+Signal bait ejected. Syncing with S.F. network complete.+Receiving. Keep your ears perked...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>：...A lively melody comes through.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What's...this? Music?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>："Ciocârlia", or "The Lark". That's an old Romanian children's folk song.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Wow! How did you know that?! M16 sure is amazing!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：The point is...why is there music?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Sangvis Ringleaders are also equipped with some kind of emotion module. If she's listening to music, she must have entered mandatory sleep mode to clear up her cache.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Then it's the perfect chance. We can move freely for now.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：But unless she says something...we won't know who we're dealing with.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：S.F. can't possibly put an inexperienced rookie T-Doll in charge of such an important guard duty.+Someone who's crossed swords with Griffin several times, whose mental age is relatively young...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...Destroyer. It can only be her.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Humph. That's not bad news, is it?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Commander, do you copy?+The Ringleader stationed at Area S02 is very likely to be Destroyer. Please adjust your battle strategies accordingly.+Now would you please help us go further in till we find a suitable base to launch the search.
