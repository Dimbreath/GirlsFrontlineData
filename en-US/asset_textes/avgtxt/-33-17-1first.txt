UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I've found the source of the interference.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 waves to the others, telling them to gather round.

HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>198</BIN><白屏2>:A human corpse?!
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But she IS the source of the disruption — well, one of them. +Hm...her lower body is mechanical. Her life signs are all gone. +Looks like it hasn't been long since she died, but what are these petals?
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you planning to conduct an autopsy here?
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, we've already done just about everything else, and besides, we'll be billing for it.+Did she die from radiation? 9, help me raise her arm. +...
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...9?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>199</BIN><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The weather has changed at some point. +A thin fog coils around UMP45, and there is nobody else here except for the corpse of the dead girl in her arms. +There is a quiet rustle of fabric, and it seems as though many people around her are mumbling something. The voice sounds familiar to UMP45, but she can't quite place it. +Then, the girl's cold and soft hand tightens its grip around hers. 
悠远的声音()<Speaker>Distant Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:The first walked into the night with the inferior articles for Father. The black of night dyed the hems of her dress, and the flower blossoms withered within the cage of the fallen. +The second was incomplete, and fell before she went out. The colors of evening froze her time, and the flower blossoms ceased to grow amidst eternal suffering. +The third held her sisters' hands, and together they charged into the day. The sunlight shattered upon her black sleeves, and the flowers fell into the steely water without blooming. +The fourth lost her friend, and lost her way within the fog. Her time has not yet come, and she merely lives by imitating her kin. +...Does the fifth stand before me?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:M4? Nyto?
悠远的声音()<Speaker>Distant Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:Are you one of us? +Are you the chosen one? +Or perhaps, are you willing to accept us?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is this some kind of code? +No, this is a forced connection... Something's reading my neural cloud... It feels like it's going to explode...
悠远的声音()<Speaker>Distant Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:Ah, she can hear us. +Ah, she knows where our friend is. +Although the Chosen One has not yet appeared, the one willing to accept us has finally come. +Wonderful. +Wonderful.

UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Are you awake? +Can you see me, 45? Answer me—
UMP9Mod(4);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Alright, stop smacking my face, I'm fine.
UMP9Mod(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Honestly, you scared me to death. +You should save all this pretend stuff for Halloween.

UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Huh? See what?
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No...it's nothing, just some weird scenes.
UMP9Mod(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:45, remember to get your neural cloud checked. +There's no telling what was inside that data packet just now.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Of course. +(Something connected with me just now... It felt like how it was back with 40.) +(It was a direct hack into my Level III base layer. Was it the same kind of technology? Have we finally found a clue?)+...Oh no! 
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Their forced connection just now was their way of searching for something, and they found what they wanted in my neural cloud!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What exactly are you talking about?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Tsk. 9, contact the Commander immediately. 416, put me through to the AR Team. If I'm not wrong, the main event is about to begin.

SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Huh? The sun's out again? The fog's gone too.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;SSG3000(0)||:The sky never went dark in the first place.
M4A1Mod(0);SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||:...Really? +Leader, are you alright?
M4A1Mod(0);DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I suddenly feel much better... It was awful just now, like someone commandeered my neural cloud. +Looks like comms are back up as well.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:Yes... I don't know what happened, but this place isn't safe. +Your mission is complete. I've already synched the defense system's IFF information to everyone. +Our train will be pulling into the station shortly. You should head back there and wait for the Commander.
M4A1Mod(0);DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Understood! But what about your team?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:We checked the room just now; the devices in there are definitely the control mechanism for the quarantine wall. But the encryption for control authoritzation is very strong, so we won't be able to activate the quarantine wall for another one and a half hours. +Still, no need to worry. There'll be a way; just leave it to us.
M4A1Mod(0);DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I see. +You guys feel really trustworthy. They always said you were all weird Dolls... It's only after meeting you that I realized you're all actually very nice people.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:Thank you, but you don't have to mention it... We're just doing our duty.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:No, it had to be said. We'll be withdrawing for now. +Thank you for saving a member of our team!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls from the recon echelon salute M4 and leave the control center.
