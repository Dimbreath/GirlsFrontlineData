Start playing.】+Now then, let's begin the training simulation for this mission.+Our main task is to hack the enemy network and disrupt their ability to fight.+How...do we do that?+Don't worry, I'll teach you!+I didn't think there would still be anyone using a tree-shaped network structure.+It's precisely because such a network still exists that we have a part to play.+Mhmm...you've got a point.+Alright, let's focus on the simulation. If we enter with this camouflage key, we can bypass the firewall and hack the enemy's control systems, allowing us to provide support for our assault teams.+Alright, I'm trying it now.+All that's left after that is to crack the enemy's system defenses. We can assume direct control if they have no physical barriers in place.+Assisting me is the best thing to do in situations like these. Give me connection access. I'll act as the mainframe and interface through a direct wired connection.+Alright...got it.+I'll go through your neural cloud to search for the fastest logic circuit so I can use your processing power to help with my own algorithms. Remember to grant me connection access.+Alright, I'm coordinated with your retrieval signal. +Right, let's begin the connection!+......+Just as I thought...+Hmm? What's wrong?+Ah, it's nothing. I've found the circuit. Please help me with the calculations once I find the breakpoint.+No problem, 40. I'll leave it to you.+...+45...+Hmm?+If the mission requires you to sacrifice yourself, would you do it?+Yes...I suppose? Besides, I can transmit my neural cloud back for reactivation.+When you transmit a neural cloud, you'll lose your memories beyond the previous backup point, and your neural cloud will receive a certain amount of damage as well...+Eh...?+And then...you'll become less and less like yourself... Would you do it even so?+...I guess I would if it's an order.+Then what if you weren't allowed to transmit your neural cloud at all, and you would have to die for real?+......+Even if I were to really die, I still don't think I would refuse. After all, a Doll's purpose in life is to follow orders.+......+Is that so...+No wonder they chose you...+Chose me?+Haha, if you were to come across such a situation for real, I hope you will choose to live.+Dying for someone else's mission isn't necessarily a glorious thing...+40...+Sorry, my mind just wandered off at a bad time. Let's continue with the hacking simulation.+...Alright.
