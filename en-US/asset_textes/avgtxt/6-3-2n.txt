()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Three hours after mobilization.
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:FAL... +That bitch... How dare she leave me at a godforsaken place like this... +It's wet and cold, and the wind is blowing sand all over my shoulders... +Arghhhhh screw everything! That tasteless and tyrannical witch! How could she do this to me?! +One day...one day, I'll take the position of team leader from her and teach her a lesson! +Calm down, 57, calm down... +I can't take this anymore. I'll just calmly make another suggestion to FAL... +Stay strong, 57. Keep up your reputation and be nice to FF FNC and FF FN49... +Right...I must also pull the Commander to my side and make a good impression...
()||:...
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? You're still here, Commander?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Ah...right. It was I who asked you not to wander off... +I'm okay. Just a teeny-tiny complaint about the cold... +Oh, now that you mentioned it, Commander, I didn't even realize how long I've actually been hanging around here. +Thank you for your concern. I'll contact FAL now and ask for further directives.
()||:Five-seven walks over to a spot where she can't be overheard and calls FAL.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:FAL. +Haven't we waited long enough? Alchemist wont' be coming.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker><通讯框>;FN57(0)||:Already at your limit?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:I'm just making a suggestion. I personally don't mind waiting a bit longer...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Come off it. Look at yourself. How are you different than the newbies?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Quoi?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:You're not speaking your mind, are you, 57?
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:... +I've never tried to hide my thoughts, FAL. I'm just politely pointing out that you won't be the team leader forever.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:Perhaps, 57. You know we're a freshly formed team, and I do make mistakes... +Perhaps this time...
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Oh? What's happening? Not every day that you admit your mistakes. +Are you admitting that it was wrong to leave your trusty adjutant to rot in a wasteland for three hours?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:That, and what I did to the newbies, as well as what's going to happen... +But it can't be helped, 57. I simply love trying to do what other T-Dolls can't.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:I know. This is exactly why we're always put on all those bizarre cases. +But you've really gone too far. Helian will not look kindly on an operation where subordinates are left for dead.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||:I'm not doing this to leave you for dead, 57. +Judging by Alchemist's disposition and the report we received, she won't target just any regular T-Doll. +Which leads me to believe that her target has probably been me all along.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Is this really the moment for such narcissism, FAL?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But...if that's the case, then your plan is to...
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:That's right, 57. I'll be the final bait.
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:... +That's the mistake you're admitting?
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Just preparing myself for the unexpected.
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:... +This won't do! It's too risky! What are we gonna do if you get caught?!
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Non, this is the safest way. This is the best opportunity to rescue the captured T-Dolls. +As for our team, that depends on you, 57...
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Me...?
()||:Click.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:57, I hereby hand over all authorizations of the team leader of Team FF to you. +Isn't this what you've always wanted?
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:So you want to just die and dump all your responsibilities on me?!
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:I did NOT say that. However, if I'm ever compromised, you're the only one who can keep Team FF operating. +You have the patience that I'll never hope to possess. +FF FNC and FF FN49 also have strong points that you don't. Make good use of them.
FN57()<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:This is happening way too fast, FAL. I'm not ready yet.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:We never are. Hurry, 57, while there's still time...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:At that moment, the door opens behind FAL.
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:And do something you've never done before. Au revoir.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Griffin's door lock really is a bit underwhelming. +Though I did think it could be a trap when I saw this outpost is practically empty.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:But you came in anyway.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Just so I can watch you put up a fight, but in the end...you haven't even prepared a welcoming party for me, FAL.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Sorry to disappoint, Alchemist. +It just so happened that I've sent off all my subordinates on errands and inadvertently left myself defenseless against you.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Humph, perhaps we're the same kind of Doll. We have all the time to confirm this. +You won't resist, I trust? After all, Griffin's firepower can't hope to measure up to me in a one-to-one.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Then what exactly are you going to do, Alchemist? Where's your weapon? Aren't you going to load it?
()||:Alchemist walks slowly into the room and puts her weapon down on the table.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:To be honest, FAL, I don't like guns. +They're too quick. They don't give me time to fully taste all the intricate emotions from your kind. +I want to take it slow. One should make the most out of what they enjoy, right?
()||:Alchemist drags a chair over from the table and sits down cross-legged.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Sit, FAL, and let's have a chat. +If I find you interesting, I might let you live.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Is that what you do to your other prey?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:You'll find out after your friends rescue them, won't you?
BOSS-5(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I know what you're planning, but I don't care. +They'll have to do their utmost best and pray for good luck if they want to get away from the dummies and subordinates I've left there. +But don't worry about them. We should focus on enjoying ourselves.
炼金术士()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Now, I'm gonna start first. +FAL...do you like shoes?
FAL()<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +You have the right person, Alchemist.
