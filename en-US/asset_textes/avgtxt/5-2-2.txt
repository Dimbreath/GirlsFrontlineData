()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+As the alarm dies down and the sound of crossfires fade into the distance, Griffin seems to have regained the upper hand.+I leave the room that can come crashing down any moment and hurry towards the hall where T-Dolls have assembled.+Right then, a voice calls out from behind me...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Oh! Commander!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN>:Commander! Are you okay?!+I...I was very worried about you...+Thank goodness you are okay.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;M4A1(3)||:You get along pretty well with M4A1 here, Commander. Looks like you've been taking very good care of her.
NPC-Kyruger(0);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:But right now, we have something to discuss, you and I.
NPC-Kyruger(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yes, sir...+Commander, I will be on stand-by along with the other members of the AR Team.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker> </Speaker>||:...M4A1 takes her leave after giving a salute. She looks back every once in a while.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You know, she's a special T-Doll, Commander.+Keep her safe. She will show what she's worth one day.+Now back to business. You did well just now, but Sangvis Ferri will press forward again any minute.+This meeting was absolutely confidential, even the base was a total secret.+However, Sangvis Ferri was able to launch such a precise attack against us, so intel must have been leaked from within our ranks.+I'll be putting Helian on this case immediately. Come with me, Commander. I have a new mission for you.

MP40(0)<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:No shoving, please. Let T-Dolls carrying small arms pass through first.+Wait! You over there! Is that FFC?+Please finish your ice cream before you join the queue. Don't drip it on someone else!+And you do not pass as a small arm! Please don't shove ahead just because you're short!
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+Everyone else is busy as hell, but still no orders for us?
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You heard M4. The commander went with Mr. Kryuger, so we'll have a big job coming soon.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The Sangvis Ringleader has not shown herself. It is highly possible that there will be a second raid.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Dammit! Can't she just come out for a showdown?!
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hmm... It's uncommon for Sangvis Ferri to spring an attack so suddenly. Our next mission is probably gonna be real tricky.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph, that's perfect, isn't it? A chance to settle the score.+...Time...is running out.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...?
