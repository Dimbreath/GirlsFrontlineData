()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2>:In the warehouse of a Sangvis base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Destroyer stops taking inventory and lets out a sigh, gazing out of the window at the drifting snow.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Two years ago today, we had a party... last year today, I got a present from Agent... This year... there's absolutely nothing this year...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer activates the AI interface installed on the wall.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:It's Christmas today, let's play a fitting song.
()<Speaker>S.F. Music</Speaker>||:Surroundings analyzed. Playing a human song written in the 20th century titled "Prison Grove". +<color=#FF1493>"An icy wind burns and scars... "</color> +<color=#FF1493>"Rushes in like a fallen star... "</color> +<color=#FF1493>"Through the narrow space between these bars... "</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer slams the off button on the AI interface.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:That's enough, now shut up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer looked outside at the falling snow once again, and lets out another sigh, this time more dejected. 
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(Sigh) I really wanna celebrate Christmas...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><回忆><BIN>129</BIN>:... Fifteen minutes ago.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:<size=25>... So, Agent. What's our plan for Christmas this year?</size>
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:What Christmas plan? +Are you unaware of how dangerously low our supplies are?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Stop acting, It's just us here, if you tell me I promise I won't tell.
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +It would appear that leaving you idle was a mistake. +Take this manifest and do an inventory check. +You can speak to me again about a Christmas plan once you get a grasp of the situation we are in. 
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><BIN>89</BIN><黑点2>:(Sigh) +As much as I know she's telling the truth from taking inventory... + I still don't want to give it up...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Agent sure is getting reckless, enough to leave inventory to you. +Although, considering how little supplies we have, I suppose even an idiot can count them, right?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:... Are you... calling me an idiot?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:You said it, not me. +Come to think of it, according to the recon report we just received, Griffin is having a huge Christmas celebration.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>;BOSS-11(0)||:What?! Those Griffin T-Dolls can afford to celebrate Christmas even though they're poor enough to scavange our parts?
BOSS-6(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Their Commander left the base early in the morning, presumbly to go shopping in the city.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, even though we can't spare the effort to have a proper celebration, we can at least play some Christmas songs to lift the mood.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Dreamer speaks as she activates the AI interface.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:It's Christmas today. Play something fitting.
()<Speaker>S.F. Music</Speaker>||:Surroundings analyzed. Playing a Christmas song. +<color=#FF1493>"We wish you a merry Christmas."</color> +<color=#FF1493>"We wish you a merry Christmas."</color>  +<color=#FF1493>"We wish you a merry Christmas and happy new year! ♪"</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer angrily slams the AI interface shut again.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Someone's got a bad temper today. +However... we could redirect that temper toward something... more productive...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Destroyer's eyes sparkle with excitement in the dim warehouse.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Then I'll go scouting. It's not like I've got much to do today anyway. +I might even seize some supplies to fill up our empty warehouse.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:How unusual, the idiot has the resolve to volunteer for a mission.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:So you WERE calling me an idiot!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager, who has been eavesdropping, barges in suddenly.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Are you guys about to go scout out the Griffin's base? +You can't trust an idiot to carry out a mission on her own, let me go with her.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:HEY! How can you act so snobby while evesdropping? +And who did you call an idiot?!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I called an idiot an idiot. +I'll meet you at the back gate in ten minutes.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||:HEY——!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑点1>:This dreary Christmas is starting to liven up. ♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... at the Griffin base.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#8B4513>... We've already given the Commander a heads-up, please do take care of Gr G11 for us, Kalina.</color> +<color=#8B4513>We will return immediately once we acquire the necessary supplies.</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#87CEFA>Well, all she does is sleep anyways. Just think of her as an ugly, heavy vase that we've deposited for safekeeping</color>
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFA500>Just sleep tight here, Gr G11. You'll get the surprise you've always wanted when you wake up~♪</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina swiftly moves the sound asleep Gr G11 to the Commander's room to keep her away from other T-Dolls. +As she gazes at Gr G11's sleeping face, an idea suddenly comes to her. She digs out a Christmas outfit and changes Gr G11 into it.
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Oh, you never took the gift from last Christmas with you! +You can still wear it this year, and I get to save some money on buying another present. ♪
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hmm... Christmas... +Presents... Heheh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>81</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_19christmas_avg</BGM>:Kalina leaves the room and quickly heads to the hall where the T-Dolls have gathered.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Merry Christmas, everyone! What a wonderful day!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Regrettably... +Our commander had to leave the base on short notice for work...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The T-Dolls burst into an uproar upon hearing the news.
OC44(2)<Speaker>OTs-44</Speaker><Position>0,-150</Position>||:(Sobs) Commander... How could this be?
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I'm sure it must be something important, otherwise the Commander definitely would've spent Christmas with us.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:W-who cares?! I'll celebrate Christmas even without the Commander!
SVD(2)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||:If the Commander isn't here, the booze in the cellar is fair game, right?
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker><Shake>||:You nasty barbarians are thinking about sneaking booze out of the cellar now that the Commander's away, aren't you?!
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Only one way to settle this, it's duel time! Winner takes this can of cola I have!
CZ75(2)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Oh, it's time to duel? Now that you mention it, I still have a score to settle with NZ75...
Ameli(2)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:It looks lively in here...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Helplessly facing the crowd of rowdy T-dolls, Kalina rubs her forehead.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ahem! That's enough, settle down! +The Commander can't spend Christmas with us this year, but—! +We should still have a proper celebration, for all the hard work we put in!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina looks at each T-Doll present to build up suspense.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Which is why I've decided to organize the first ever Secret Santa at Griffin!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The T-Dolls start chattering excitedly.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I've already sent out the document explaining the details. +To put it simply, everyone prepares a present and leaves it at a designated location with a given number. +After that, everyone who has deposited their present will get to draw a number for a random present. All free of charge, of course!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Isn't that exciting?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Hearing Griffin T-Dolls cheering in excitment. Kalina nods with satisfaction.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:What's even more exciting... +The Commander has also prepared a gift. We'll have to see who's lucky enough to get it!
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Yaho! Commander must've prepared a year's worth of cola for me!
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:As if! I'm sure it's the newest game bought especially for me!
Ameli(2)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:Hmm... Guess I'll just include the button that just tore off of my jacket in the present.
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I gave the Commander an introductory CD last year... Then this time I'll...
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Preparing gifts and whatnot is such a chore... But since it's already decided, guess I'll just have to do it properly...
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Then let's all head out to search for present materials around the base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>7</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... Behind a shady corner near the Griffin base.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:... Spying on Griffin's Christmas plans? Did you really come all the way here for something so pointless?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Though we are both Sangvis, the difference between our artistic pursuit and discipline is obvious. +For instance, I can precisely tell how pointless it is to persist in giving the traitor, Architect, a present every year.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... Cut the chit-chat while we're at work. +Look out, The Griffin groundhogs are coming out of their hidey-holes.
