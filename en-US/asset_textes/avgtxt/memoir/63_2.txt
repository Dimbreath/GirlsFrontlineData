G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Finally...it's over.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:I don't feel any different. Are you sure the maintenance is complete?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:Ja...it's really complete. +Now all we need to do is tidy up this place...
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:It's all Taunt's fault! She knocked that rack over!
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Me? You knocked over a lot of stuff yourself.
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:I'm really sorry about that. I want to help, but I don't have hands!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Please don't argue... I can clean up by myself.
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Why are you here on your own, Miss Gr G3?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Yeah, did you get bullied?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Don't say that. It's nothing of that sort.
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Before, the others always came as a group to perform maintenance, and they'd always leave the moment it's done.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:And here you are, entirely on your own, and staying behind to tidy up... +Looks very much like bullying to me.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:I only had to tidy up because of your mischief... +I did not get bullied. Stop saying that.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:I see! Listen to that feeble rebuke!
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:So that's how it is. We seem to have a goody-two-shoes who doesn't know how to say no.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Fairy maintenance is only such a headache because of you. +If you could just be nice and cooperate, it wouldn't be something that everyone dreads doing.
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Everyone is shoving things they dread doing to Miss Gr G3. You sure have it rough.
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:I know, right?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:You guys... +(Sighs) Nevermind...
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:But don't worry, we can help!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:...Help?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>;FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:Don't tell me, Warrior...you're planning to tell her about THAT...?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>;FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Can't be helped! Doesn't your conscience bother you at all after smashing so many things just now?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Hmm...
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:By "help"...do you mean you'll stop being naughty?
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Nope, we're taking you to the Fairy Queen!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:...Fairy Queen?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:The Fairy Queen can help you, Miss Gr G3. +Few people know of her existence, but not everyone can see her.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Is she...also one of our Fairies? +No, wait. Why are you taking me to her?
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Because she has magical powers. +Those who see her can have any wish granted.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:This...doesn't sound realistic at all.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Come with us to see the Fairy Queen! +Being a victim of bullying, you must have lots of wishes!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:I did NOT get bullied!
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Bah! We can all tell!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:... +Sigh... +Has this Fairy Queen...helped others before?
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Sure she has. +Armor wished to have the text on her shield changed to something other than Russian. Rocket wanted a haircut.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:The Fairy Queen helped us all.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:Hmm... +Then has any T-Doll like me ever sought this Fairy Queen?
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:I'm not too sure about T-Dolls... +But the Commander has.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:The Commander?
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Everyone said it was the Commander's greatest wish to find the Fairy Queen. +Though no Fairy knows what came of it in the end.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||:What kind of wish...would drive the Commander to seek the Fairy Queen?
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Could be anything.
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Cooler A/C! More games! More chicken drumsticks in your meal!
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:You, too, can wish for anything once you meet the Fairy Queen, Miss Gr G3!
G3(0);FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:But I...don't know what I want...
G3(0);FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Think about things that bother you and just settle them. It's not that hard.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Hmm...I see... +Then where do I...we find the Fairy Queen? +Is she also in the Fairy Chamber like you?
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:A castle made of plastic is no place for a Fairy Queen to live. +She has her own throne where she awaits those who seek her.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:I thought...seeing the Fairy Queen wouldn't be that easy?
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We're Fairies! +Just follow us and you'll see her soon enough!
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2>:Gone...
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Hmm? Is something wrong with this empty shelf?
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Queen isn't on her throne... She's gone!
