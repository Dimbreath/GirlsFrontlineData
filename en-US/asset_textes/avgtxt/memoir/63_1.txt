指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I know this is asking a bit too much, but it has to be done...
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Uhh...but you're really putting us in a tough spot...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please don't be like that. Think about how the Tactical Fairies have always been serving you so tirelessly!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:We don't have to stay that close to them in combat. I suppose it can be done if we can perform maintenance remotely...
()||:...
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Is something...the matter?
G3(0);80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Oh, it's you, Gr G3. +The Commander is trying to get someone to perform maintenance on the Fairy system.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;80type(0)||:Huh...? If it's just a simple system maintenance, why is everybody gathered here?
G3(0);80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:So you've never done this before? Nobody wants to do it because it's such a chore. You can't be distracted even for a second when you're with the Fairies. +Hmm, wouldn't Gr G3's disposition make her the perfect candidate for this mission?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;80type(0)||:My disposition?
G3(0);80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:You're so docile I'm sure it'll be fine even if the Fairies make mischief.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>;80type(0)||:That doesn't sound right...
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Commander, I think Gr G3 is perfect for this job! +With her patience, no Fairy can ruffle her feathers.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No...why are you all so terrified of the Fairies...? +And are you willing to accept this assignment, Gr G3?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Huh...? Hold on...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It'd be great if someone takes up the job willingly. I really don't want to issue it as a command...
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Just take it, Gr G3. Maybe the Fairies will settle down when they're with you.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:But I don't know...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Give it a try. Who knows? Type 80 could be right and you could be perfect for the job.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:I... +Alright...I'll get it done... +Though I'm not sure...
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Gr G3 agreed!
()||:...The gathered Griffin T-Dolls all whoop and cheer.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Phew, that's great. We'll be counting on you, Gr G3. +I almost thought I'd have to find them in the Fairy Chamber myself...
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:... +Sigh...how did this happen...?
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:With that, my morning is freed up. Want some bubble gum, Gr G3?

FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:How long do I have to stay connected to these cables...? Is the maintenance not over yet?
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Please hold on for just a little. The system check will take a few more minutes.
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:This Fairy is rather stupid so it'll take a bit longer.
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:What kind of bullcrap is that? Don't you go running off! Come back this instant!
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:W-wait, the maintenance isn't over yet...! +And please don't zoom around indoors!
()||:...The Fairies knock over the rack on the side, spilling parts everywhere.
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Oh dear...
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Look what you've done. You knocked over the rack.
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>||:Look what YOU have done. You snapped the cables connecting you to the maintenance system.
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>||:Whoa...you're right. +But it's fun flying around with them and having them flap about.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
G3(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:... +So this is why nobody wants to perform maintenance on the Fairies... +But back then...there was no way I could've refused...
