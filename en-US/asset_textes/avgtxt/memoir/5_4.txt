M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I haven't been able to have a proper conversation with M1895 ever since that mission. +She's always quiet on the few occasions I see her... I'm a little worried. I think I'll go have a chat with her.

M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:So there you are, M1895. I was looking high and low for you... +Hm? What are those parts on the table?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Good afternoon, Mosin-Nagant. +I just got these from Kalina. I'm thinking of modifying my gear.
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You changed your clothes too?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Yup, they just arrived a couple of days ago! +I asked Kalina to help me get them too.
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Why did you end up doing these things all of a sudden?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:I spoke with P99 and P38, and they gave me some suggestions. +I need to rack my brains so I don't fall behind the young ones.
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I originally came here to help straighten you out. Looks like it wasn't necessary.
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Learning new things isn't bad. I feel like I've become stronger too. +It's just...I'd like it if I could get a little taller.
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You can't grow any taller?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Yeah... I asked Kalina, and she said that she couldn't do anything about it at this stage...
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You'll always be my strong and cute little sister even if you're not tall.
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||<震屏>:...Don't start acting like a big sister out of nowhere!
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Fine, fine. I'm relieved to see you so fired up. +I'm sure the Commander will also be surprised by your new look.
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Really? Then I'll go find the Commander after this!
M1895Mod(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Before that... +How about a drink to celebrate?
M1895Mod(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||<黑屏1>:Sure, I'm in a pretty good mood now.
纳甘左轮()<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I've decided... +In the days to come, I'll show the Commander something— +That the new me is more reliable than those new-model Dolls!
