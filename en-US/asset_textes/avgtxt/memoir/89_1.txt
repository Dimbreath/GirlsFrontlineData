BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:...Done. +Now, let's see my data today...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Bren opens the training statistics interface...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Same results as yesterday. +I haven't been making any progress at all lately. Why is that...? +Never mind. I'll get some rest first.

IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:No, no, no! That's way too solemn, nya!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:But it won't be elegant enough if we make it too cutesy...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:What are you two jabbering about?
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Oh, you're back, Bren! +Come and see if the style I chose is better, nya!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Huh?
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Actually... +I'm planning to organize a tea party and invite the Commander as well as everyone else to attend.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Doing something so meaningless out of the blue... What has got into your head?
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Our workload hasn't been particularly heavy recently, so I want to make good use of our free time.
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:The Commander and the others have all helped us out a lot before, nya! +I want to thank them properly~
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Have you informed Welrod about this?
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:We only started discussing the details after we got her approval.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Is that so...? Then where is she?
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:She's gone to invite the Commander. +Let's come up with a plan while she's out.
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Yeah, let's make up our mind already! +If we did the decorations in Welrod's style, everyone would run away screaming, nya!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Who cares about such things...
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:If you have any décor styles you like, do speak up! +We even managed to borrow the café for this party. Who knows when we'll get to do this again if we don't make the best of it this time, nya~
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:I'm not interested. Do whatever you want.
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:That won't do! +You're also part of the team, nya! +Since it's a team effort, we must also take your opinion into consideration, nya!
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:IDW is right~ +C'mon, Bren, just speak your mind.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:... +...Enough! You're getting on my nerves!
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:B-Bren...?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:I have zero interest in this business. +I have no opinion whatsoever, nor do I want to have any.
BrenMK(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Bren... +It-it's fine if you don't have anything to say about the party, but it'd be great if you can come, nya...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:No, thanks. +If you want to waste your free time on that, be my guest. +I'm a Griffin T-Doll, not a princess who can afford to sit languidly at a café sipping tea.
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Sorry, Bren... +We're just trying to help everyone relax...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...I'm going back to my room. +Don't bother me again.
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bren turns around and left.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Why is Bren so angry...? +Did I say something wrong?
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:I'm not sure either...
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:What's the matter? +Why are you standing there all gloomy? This isn't behavior that befits allies of justice.
Welrod(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Uh...what?! +How come you're back so soon, Welrod?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Well, the Commander accepted the invitation readily enough. +So what's going on with you? Why do you look so dejected?
Welrod(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.5</黑屏1>:Bren...
()||<黑屏2>0.5</黑屏2>:L85A1 and IDW told Welrod of what just happened.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Is that so...? I see.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Ugh...I have absolutely no idea why Bren was so angry.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:I'm a little worried about her. She's been rather restless lately.
L85A1(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Huh? Hasn't she always been surly?
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:This is different. +Something seems to be on her mind... But we'll only rile her up even further if we ask her about it.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Welrod, could we trouble you to find out what made her so mad?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Of course I'll go. +As the team leader, it is my responsibility to monitor every member's condition.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:I want to enjoy a nice cuppa with Bren~ +Make sure you bring Bren around, nya!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Thank you, Captain Welrod.
()||:Meanwhile. +Bren coldly watches the three Dolls deep in conversation from around the corner.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...How foolish. +I won't slow my pace to accommodate you... Never.
