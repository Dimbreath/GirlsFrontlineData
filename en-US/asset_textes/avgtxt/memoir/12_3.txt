HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><BIN>86</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:You okay there, sweetheart?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Uh... Oh, yeah... Thank you. +C-could you...come with me for a second?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;C96(1)||:For what? It looks pretty dark in there. You'd better not kidnap me just because I'm cute.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Uh...um...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;C96(1)||:You poor thing, you look distraught! Alright, I'll come with you. +Did you lose something or...
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;C96(1)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...What's the meaning of this?
HK45(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:Listen here, pretty one. You seem all pampered and delicate, I bet you won't like being treated roughly. +So just hand over your money and your phone.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:I'm on my way to a performance, so the most valuable item here is myself. +If you want money, you'll have to talk to my agent.
HK45(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:You have their number on your phone? +...Where's your phone? Hand it over.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:I never bring my phone with me to a performance in case of any information leak. +But I remember the number. I'll tell you and you can call my agent.
HK45(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:The dancer recites a string of numbers.
HK45(2);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:You taking me for a fool? If I call this number, I'll soon find myself sipping tea at the police station. +What's with my rotten luck... +Red 9! Lock her up in the house back there and keep her quiet. Let me see what I can do with this phone number...
C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:You said you wouldn't hurt her!
C96(1);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:Am I hurting her? I'm just telling you to move her somewhere else. If anything happens to her, it's your fault.
C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:B...but...this just isn't right! (Sobs) What should I do, Commander...?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><BIN>89</BIN><黑屏2>:Ack! It's so dusty in here. My costume is getting all dirty.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:What are you doing here, Gr HK45?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Hm? Who's Gr HK45? I'm just a cute dancer who loves dancing.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:You ARE Gr HK45! This is the breezy costume you were telling me about, isn't it?!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Passing Dancer</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Does it matter? Just think of this as a brilliant performance, and I'm a cute dancer who happens to be passing by.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Um... Alright then, “dancer who happens to be passing by” Gr HK45.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Call me what you like. Idols exist to satisfy people's fantasies. +That man out there is obviously a scoundrel. What are you doing with that kind of human trash?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:I...I can't disobey his orders. +He's human, and I'm a Doll... Dolls are meant to serve humans, right? +We fight Sangvis Ferri because their Dolls don't obey and even attack humans.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:But some humans do illegal things even in human society, don't they?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:True... He's always been like this.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:He doesn't dance. He only knows how to bully people and Dolls into doing his bidding... He even sold you once.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:I just don't understand...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:What don't you understand?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:It is a Doll's duty to obey and serve humans. +The Commander is an unusually kind person who makes life better for Dolls. Miss Kalin is the same. She even took the time to put together a neural upgrade proposal for me. +Also, nobody at Griffin tells me to shut up.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Yeah, the Commander really is super nice. +They dance with me and do a brilliant job of directing us in battle... +Wait, Kalina, don't shove... Speaking of which, Miss Kalina said you turned down the neural upgrade?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:It would be wrong for me to accept it... I already had a bad feeling even before I came to meet Gold Toad. +Until I joined Griffin, I never thought I'd ever have such a happy life. +I have friends, a fantastic Commander, a good salary, and even holidays. +I couldn't waste Griffin's resources when I knew I would probably never return...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Then why are you helping this guy?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Because he is also human... I just don't understand... I didn't even know humans can be so different from one another. +I should help him the way I help the Commander, but I don't want to.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:We can't resist orders given by humans because we are made to serve. +Just like we can't do anything about the weather on the day of a performance.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:I don't think the Commander will ever forgive me. +I asked for a leave of absence to assist Gold Toad in mugging innocent people, now I've abducted you, and you'll probably miss your performance.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Right, that's exactly right. Griffin can't ignore what happened... We are a security contractor, after all.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:If I submit myself to a memory wipe, can we pretend none of this ever happened...?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:C96!
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<震屏>:Uh, yes?!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Question time! What should you do if you trip and twist your ankle during a rehearsal?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Wrap up the ankle and continue with the rehearsal!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:What if an erroneous command has been issued?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Uh...uh... What should I do then?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:You try to correct it.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:But I can't defy him...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:His order was to move me into this house, right? You've already completed this task.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Yes, I have.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:You cannot disobey orders given by a human, but right now, you are on standby mode, with no pending orders. +I would like you to do something for me.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Name it and I'll do it!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Could you please fetch that man for me? Gold Toad, I believe? Tell him to come in.
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Uh...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:I'm not countermanding any orders, am I? Of course, I'm just a Doll like you, so you can always refuse. +Are you going to refuse?
HK45(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:(I've never seen Gr HK45 like this... She's almost like the Commander.) +No, I'm not! I don't want to!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||<黑屏1>:Then if you'd please.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:The corner of the alleyway is as dark as ever.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:What a pain. Maybe I should just sell her. That might actually be safer.
NPC-PasserbyM(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Mr. Gold Toad, there's a bit of a problem... +I'm not sure what to do. I think you should take a look yourself.
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>;C96(1)||:What problem now? Women are nothing but trouble – be them human or Doll...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;C96(1)||<黑点1>:Gold Toad keeps mouthing off as he heads into the warehouse.
()<Speaker>Weepy Female Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>88</BIN><黑点2>:Ow...ow ow ow... I think I twisted my ankle...
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:Huh? Is this why you asked me to come here?! You're a freaking piece of junk, Red 9! +Lemme tell you, you little...
HK45(3)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM><震屏>:A round of applause as the performance begins!
NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:The hell?! Hey... Whoa!! ...You bitch!
HK45(3)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;NPC-PasserbyM(0)||:Of course, I can't hurt humans either, but this hardly counts, right? +Here, C96. Stuff this into his mouth.
HK45(3);NPC-PasserbyM(0)<Speaker>Gold Toad</Speaker>||:(Gargles)
HK45(3);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:(Pants heavily) +We did it... Unbelievable...
HK45(3)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Well? What do you think about this surprise? +Call the police! Time for us to withdraw.
HK45(3);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Okay!
