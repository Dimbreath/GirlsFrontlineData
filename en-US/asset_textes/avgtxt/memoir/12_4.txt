()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Three hours later, back in the Griffin command room.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Welcome back, C96!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...What are you looking for?
NPC-Kalin(2);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<震屏>:Huh?! How can you be here, Gr HK45?!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:I've been preparing for the show the whole time. +Why are you all flustered, C96? Did that guy try to mess with you?
HK45(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:No, this can't be right! You were just helping me! You even had the costume on!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>;C96(1)||:I've been here the whole time. Ask the Commander if you don't believe me.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:I can also vouch for that. She hasn't left this room even once. Why do you ask?
NPC-Kalin(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Then...the woman who helped me back then really wasn't Gr HK45?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:What are you talking about, C96? +Have you finished your business with your former master?
NPC-Kalin(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:C96 reporting back for duty! I have! +I sent him to where he belongs!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:That's great! Then you'll be able to work for us in peace, right?
NPC-Kalin(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Affirmative! From now on, I am just C96, nothing more, nothing less!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Then to continue our previous conversation – why did you reject the neural upgrade proposal?
NPC-Kalin(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Why...why on earth did I do that? +I think...I have no reason to do that at all... +Can I still accept it, Miss Kalin?! I want to become stronger – more like...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Like...?
NPC-Kalin(0);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:More like the dancer who happened to be passing by!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;C96(1)||:Who? +...Goodness. You'd better be more specific. +Good thing I haven't submitted this batch of requests yet. Take this and make your amendments.
NPC-Kalin(3);C96(1)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Got it!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:C96 rushes out of the command room. +Now that she's gone, the trio in the command room exchange a knowing grin with one another.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, that's problem solved. Commander, you sure did put on a brilliant show!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:And hats off to you too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Soon afterward, C96 submitted a detailed report on the incident, and Griffin technicians have started to think about how to solve the issue regarding the command prioritization of our Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Several days later, in the Griffin base.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, C96.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Oh, Commander! Good afternoon!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You look great in that outfit.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Heheh... Gr HK45 altered my old uniform and gave it to me before I went through the procedure. It looks awesome so I've been wearing it all the time~ +I don't know why, but it feels like we haven't met in ages!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's because you've been going on mission after mission without a break.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:I feel...empty the moment I stop, so I just want to keeping working.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you still bothered by what happened?
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:I assisted a human in crime. The attempt wasn't successful, but it was a mistake nonetheless. I have to work hard to make amends!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's good that you're so driven. Still, Gr HK45's ball is tonight. Are you sure you want to apply for yet another mission?
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker><Shake>||:Oh...!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:My questions seems to have hit her where it hurts. C96's face falls, and she shakes her head.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:No...I'll stay.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then I'll see you this evening.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Wait, Commander, there's something I'd like to ask you! +Um...about the dancer in the city! Was she really not Gr HK45?
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Well... +<c>I wonder. <c>I have no idea. <c>(Hums)
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Commander, give me a straight answer!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Tell me, tell me, tell me!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<震屏><分支>3</分支>:Commander! Stop pretending you can't hear me! I'll just keep asking!
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I really don't know. I wasn't there on the scene. +I'm just an ordinary human, not a clairvoyant.
C96Mod(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Was I just imagining things then...? Eh, never mind. +I'd better go and help Gr HK45 prepare for the show... +Bye, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Doll Dummies can be remotely controlled by humans, though nobody would do that normally. +C96 should know about that, right? But the thought doesn't seem to have occurred to her at all. +As I watch C96 run off to the dormitory, I decide it's probably best if I don't tell her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:... +That evening, the ball that Gr HK45 had meticulously planned went ahead smoothly. +C96 and Gr HK45, in their matching outfits, danced through the night. +Though it didn't last too long, the Dolls got to put on pretty outfits and had a great time... +It would've been even better if they hadn't all invited me to dance at the same time. Being caught in a tug of war among Dolls really wasn't pleasant. +Kalina, are my arms still there? I can't feel them...
