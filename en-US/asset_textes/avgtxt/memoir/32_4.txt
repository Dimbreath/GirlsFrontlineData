MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:You say such amazing things about ice cream, but it just tastes kinda meh.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:If you can't tell how expensive it is, then just give me your share.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:No way. You're gonna be overweight if you keep eating. +This is for your sake!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Wow, thanks.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:You're welcome. +You're heading back tomorrow. We can't let Negev see how much fat you've gained, can we?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:...
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Huh? What's with that face? +If you want a longer break, just tell the Commander to extend your trash picking duty.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:Nah. +After what happened, I realized wherever I am...there's always a risk of getting shot if I'm not careful.
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Then just get stronger. +Apply to the Commander for an upgrade...or pick up some useful equipment off the road.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:These things don't happen every day. It's no use thinking about it until I really need it. +... +You, though... Aren't you sad at all that you had to blow up your hard-earned piece of new equipment?
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:What do you mean hard-earned? It practically fell from the sky. +I ended up destroying what I should've long ago with it...so I'm not sorry at all.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:Really? +If you had chosen to return with it, you could be rejoining the squad with me.
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Hmm...that DOES sound very tempting...but it's best not to accept any deals with the devil. +I wonder though... When did you notice something wasn't right?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:It looked suspicious right from the start, you dunce! +I'd even been trying to stop it from making you do all sorts of stuff without you knowing.
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Then why didn't you tell me?!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:It was a suspicion, but what if I was wrong? +Besides...I was also curious how much your combat effectiveness would improve with a hardware upgrade.
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Sigh...you had it pretty hard, huh... +I guess I do deserve to stay here since I didn't notice at all.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:But what if you can choose to leave?
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:... +Never mind. It's not actually so bad here if I don't think about it too much. +Low-risk...no squad leader that goes ballistic on me.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:Oh?
AR(0);MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Stop snickering. I don't remember what I said at the end of it all. +But I gave the whole thing a proper thought. Now that I've wrapped up this unfinished business, there's nothing to worry about anymore. +As for my other problems...sometimes there are no second chances. I suppose that's the price for not working hard to improve myself in the past.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZI(0)||:But what if you're given the choice again?
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Wait... What are you trying to—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Afternoon.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Ah, Tavor. Is everything ready?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Yes, all preparations are complete.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Tavor's here for you, Galil. +So that's it then. Let's grab an ice cream together again some other time.
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Hmm? I'm not here for Galil.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Huh?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:I'm here to notify Miss Uzi that the Commander wants you to collect your new equipment from IOP. The repairs are done.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:E...equipment? +But didn't I...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Galil brought back the debris while withdrawing. +IOP has repaired and recalibrated it to your specifications.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:That kind of absurd military-class output will most definitely be downgraded, but at least there won't be any more weird, meddling AI. +Feel free to use your new-found power to chase after your dreams.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:But I... +I'm just an idiot...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:A person who proves that she can make up for her past mistakes is no idiot. +Even Negev hasn't always been this smart. She paid a much heavier price than you.
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Is this...really okay? +This isn't a joke, is it...? I don't think I can take it...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hmm... If you think you're not ready, by all means, pick up the equipment whenever you want. +In Negev's exact words..."We'll be waiting for you, right here."

()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Seal off the entrance and do everything you can to divert the enemy's attention once you're outside. +What'll happen to the rest of the intel...is entirely up to luck.
()<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Just give me two more minutes! I can...
()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:LEAVE IT, YOU IDIOT! +Do you want to die here alone?!
()<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I can do it... I MUST do it...
()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:I know you can, but this isn't up to you. +There'll be other opportunities for us to come back and destroy it later. There's no need to be so hung up on it now!
()<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:But...what if we get separated while we withdraw?!
()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:What are you afraid of? +If you fall behind, pick up your pace and catch up. If you get lost, think about where the others would go if they're on their own. +Even if you can't catch up, you mustn't stop trying. Or is everything we've been through a lie?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Guys...it took me a while. +But this time...I will NOT fall behind!
