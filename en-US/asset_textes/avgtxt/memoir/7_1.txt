()<Speaker></Speaker>||:In a bright room totally unlike the Commander's command room. +The command room always gives off a cold and oppressive feeling. +It is very warm in here. +This place...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Subject No. 7, your name?</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Stechkin. +Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin'.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', the test is about to begin. Ready?</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Stop wasting my time. Go ahead.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Recite your baseline.</color>+<color=#FFD700>The noble hold despicable acts in contempt. Atop their high horse, the noble look down on the despicable for committing despicable acts. Despicable.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Despicable.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Is there anything you find despicable in what your job requires you to do? Despicable.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Despicable.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Has anyone called you despicable because of your job? Despicable.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...Despicable.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', the system has detected irregular emotional fluctuations. Noble.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Noble.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Has anyone praised you for your work? Noble.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Noble.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Has anyone told you to think about the bigger picture? Noble.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Noble.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Do you yearn to be praised? Noble.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Noble.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>The noble hold despicable acts in contempt.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:The noble hold despicable acts in contempt.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Why don't you say that three times?</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...The noble hold despicable acts in contempt. The noble hold despicable acts in contempt. The noble hold despicable acts in contempt.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The system has detected irregular emotional fluctuations...? +Who is it behind this machine? Is it the Commander? +Or is it really just a machine that's examining me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', answer the following question.</color> +<color=#FFD700>What is it that matters to you the most?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Oh, I almost forgot what I'm doing here. +Questions. Always these kinds of questions.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', what is it that matters to you the most?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:What is it that matters to me the most? +As a Doll, what means the most to me...? +Shopping? True, I love shopping. +The Commander? Hm... I do enjoy pestering the Commander into giving me some spare change. +But what matters the most has still got to be...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', answer the question.</color> +<color=#FFD700>What is it that matters to you the most?</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Money, of course.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Is there anything that matters more? Probably not. +How many times have I been asked this question? I've lost count. +This room is so bright it's almost dazzling... +This place...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', why do you value money above all else?</color> 
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Only money is omnipotent. Money has the power to determine a person's life and death. +I've seen too much on my missions... +The poor living in this area can't even afford medical care. Death is their only option.
APS(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Do not use humans as reference, Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin'.</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Ha, no...? +Isn't it the same for us Dolls? Without money, how are we supposed to acquire the resources we need? +Many Dolls in the base are struggling to make ends meet.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', let's put it in a different way.</color> +<color=#FFD700>Which is more important, money or Griffin's survival?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Which is more important? +Ha, if that's what you want to know, why didn't you just get straight to the point? +Of course it's—
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Of course it's Griffin's survival. +Griffin...is what matters the most to me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Hm? This happened again. My emergency calibration protocol intervened and answered the question for me again. +Ha, what the hell is this...? Some kind of defense mechanism? To protect my core from being dismantled?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:<color=#FFD700>Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin', confirm your response.</color> +<color=#FFD700>Which is more important, money or Griffin's survival?</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Alright, alright... +Defense mechanism... Ha, what a joke. It's making me contradict myself... +Fine, fine... +It's always the same, so why would it make an exception this time?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Griffin's survival. +That matters more to me than money.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏1>:<color=#FFD700>Thank you, Subject No. 7, Automatic Pistol ‘Stechkin'. We're done.</color>
()||<BIN>9</BIN><白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Snap.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bright lights are turned off. I knew it. This room, this place... +My neural cloud has always been cold and dark. +The Commander's command room might actually be warmer...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:Whoosh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...The door slides open, revealing a hallway in the Griffin base.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:This had better be the last time. What a drag...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin squints, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the glaring sunlight in the hallway.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What's the point of doing such tests...? +Even if I fail...
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Even if you fail, can't they just reset your neural cloud and dump you back onto the battlefield?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin looks up and sees a Doll leaning against the wall.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Oh? You're here. +Don't say such things. If they find out, they'll drag you over for tests as well.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Uh... +That's what you kept muttering to yourself after you came out from the last test... I was just repeating it. +So, you won't have to do this again, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin nods.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Good. It doesn't feel right when we're missing a teammate. +Also, I need to tell you about something urgent.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Stechkin walks up to OTs-12, whose blue eyes are gleaming with nothing but mirth.
