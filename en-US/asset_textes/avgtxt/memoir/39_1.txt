M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Like I was saying, didn't you think it was hilarious, SVT-38? +I just couldn't hold it in back then!
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:I can't believe you actually laughed out loud at a place like that... It was very rude. +I would have done my best to hold myself back if I had been in your place.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You're just saying that because you didn't see the cat and the look on the Commander's face!
()||:...
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:...
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:So where did the cat go after that...? +It wasn't being bullied by anyone, was it?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It was the one bullying us! +We had to bring out the entire team to catch it!
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||:...Can I speak with you, Mosin-Nagant?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hm? Ah...okay?
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2>:I'll dispense with the formalities. +What happened, Mosin-Nagant?
OTs14(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Hm? I don't know what you mean. +Are you talking about how that stray cat interrupted the Commander's briefing?
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:No, I'm talking about you.
OTs14(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...I don't understand. I don't know what you're talking about. +Could you give me a more solid hint... Maybe that might bring something to mind?
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:I see... +Alright, I know. Maybe I was mistaken. +Sorry for asking you an odd question.
OTs14(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's fine! Ask me anything you want!
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:... +Big Sis...could you help me get something from on top of the cabinet?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Uh...ah, alright. You want me to get the cup from up there? +Honestly, who was it that put it in such a high place?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Here's the cup. Take it.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...Mm, thanks.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's time for the meeting. I'll see you in the conference room.
()||:...Mosin-Nagant leaves.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Have you guys...noticed something funny about Mosin-Nagant recently?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Mosin-Nagant...? +She seems like her usual self to me?
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Well, if there's anything strange about her... +I'd have to say that she seems more cheerful than usual, right?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Yes! That's the problem!+Mosin-Nagant must be bothered by something! I've never seen her like that before!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Uh... I don't really see a difference. +But considering this is M1895 talking, I doubt you'd be mistaken right, right?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.5</黑屏1>:Given my experience, I'm sure of it! +The question now is...what happened to Mosin-Nagant... +How did she end up like this...?
()||<BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>0.7</黑屏2>:... +Late on a certain night. +There's a quiet knock on the Cafe door.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:Please come in.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:... +...May I know if...if you're still open?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Of course we are. While it's almost closing time, we can still provide coffee and cake. +Have a seat, Miss Mosin-Nagant. What would you like?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Hm... The usual coffee will do...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Alright. +Still, very few people come here at this time. Did you arrange to meet someone for something?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:No... +It's just... I simply couldn't get to sleep.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:It's not a good idea to drink coffee when you can't sleep, you know.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's fine. If need be, I'll just turn off certain functions.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hehe, I understand. +A moment, please.
()||:...
()||:Springfield takes out the coffee maker she had already washed and put away and begins brewing more coffee.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:♪～♬～
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:... +Springfield...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hm? What's the matter?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Ah... +No...it's nothing...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Here's your coffee.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Thank you.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Let me know if you'd like anything else~
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Alright... +... +Springfield.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hm? What is it?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Um...actually... +Recently...something happened... +Oh, I'm not being bullied or anything, I'm just giving myself trouble...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:... +Hm, then what's the occasion?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Some time ago, the Commander told me that I was scheduled for a neural upgrade...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Isn't that a good thing? +Wouldn't improving your combat abilities help you in battle?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Well, that's true, but the upgrade is way too extensive... +Now, I'm not against designs with hardened alloys or tactical guide rails... +But I honestly feel that once I'm modified with those, I won't be the original me anymore. +What's the point of getting stronger if I can't carry on the legacy of my bloodline?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hm...can't you just refuse or state your opinion about it? +Surely the Commander would hear you out, right?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's not that I can't refuse... +But I was moved up on the schedule because the Commander was worried about the growing gap between my combat effectiveness versus that of my juniors. +If this goes on, I'll probably be transferred out of the combat echelons...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:So that's how it is... +A lot of the people who came here recently have been talking about how you seemed to have something on your mind.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Eh...? So the others noticed too... +And here I thought I was hiding it very well... +I don't want the others to get the wrong impression about the Commander or gossip behind the Commander's back...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Maybe it would be best to just tell the others about this. They're all worried about you.  +The more you bottle this up in your heart, the harder it'll be to make a decision.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Make a decision, huh... +Springfield... Right now... I honestly have no idea what I should do.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:... +Still...why are you so adamant on this issue? +It really doesn't seem like your usual style.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Actually, when I was first refitted into a Tactical Doll... I had a lot of inexplicable system conflicts with the Imprint system of my gun... +Perhaps it was because back then, I insisted that I was more suitable for a cutting-edge weapon, rather than an antique. +But after I came to understand its history and its legacy, I realized that there were many things about it that I could be proud of. +Ever since then, there hasn't been any more conflicts.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Indeed. After all, the relationship between the Imprint and the neural cloud isn't as simple as it seems in theory.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I can carry it proudly onto the frontlines because I accept and admire this bloodline. +So...that is the one thing on which I cannot compromise.
