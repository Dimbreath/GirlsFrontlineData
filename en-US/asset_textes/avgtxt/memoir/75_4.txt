()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:... +In the Griffin Operations Room.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That's the plan. Our objective is the same, to recover critical cargo from the S.F. base. +This time round, M1918's team will be in charge of attacking the core region. +The other teams will be focused on providing cover and mounting diversionary attacks.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Eh? Us?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>:Also, because M1918 better understands the finer points of the mission... +She will be directing this operation from now on. Dismissed.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:So not only are we the main force now, we're also pretty much in charge of this mission. +Don't you think that's a pain, Leader?
xm3(0);M1918Mod(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Well... it is kind of taxing on my processor cycles... +But at the very least, I'm still your team leader, and I won't allow what happened last time to happen again.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>;M1918Mod(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Well, what happened last time was because the S.F. defenses were too tricky to handle, and besides, it was FAL who gave the order. +This time... well, I don't think there'll be any problems.
xm3(0);M1918Mod(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:It's alright... no matter what happens. +I will be solely responsible for your safety from now on. +I won't fight so sloppily anymore.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:Oh, looks like your modifications went pretty well, Miss M1918. +I didn't think the technology would be that compatible.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:Don't be silly, this is FN technology.  +There's nothing that we can't accomplish.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Rather, the fact that we used ready-made technology to upgrade M1918... +I wonder if SCAR would get mad if she found out?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:She won't mind. Rather, it would be better that way.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:Well, you do know her better. Still, the upgrade proposal made M1918's Imprint more similar to ours. +In the future, it'll be easier for her to have her assist us in the FN Team.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:So you were actually planning for that all along... +All I can say is that I have to hand it to you, Miss Five-seven.
FAL(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN>:What's wrong with that? +Establishing better relationships with others isn't a bad thing!
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>97</BIN>:You're not so much building a better relationship with her, rather, you're bringing her into the fold, aren't you.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>:Miss M1918 has finally emerged from her secluded little room, FAL. +Right now, you don't just need to worry about being surpassed by me, but by your ancient senior too.
