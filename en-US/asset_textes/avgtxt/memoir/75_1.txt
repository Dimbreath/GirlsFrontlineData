xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I've had enough of you, M1918! How can you be so useless? +How can you call yourself a Tactical Doll after turning in a performance like that?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Miss XM3, that's going too far. Miss M1918 is our team leader, you know!
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;SuperSASS(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:It's alright. Super SASS. Let her speak.
M1918(0);xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:"Let her speak."? Do you even know where your problems lie, Leader? +How did you even become our team leader when you're so careless about missions? +Is it because you've been around a long time? What use is your experience, anyway?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;xm3(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:...
M1918(0);xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hmph... Nothing to say? +That means we can't even get through to each other on a basic level, doesn't it? +M1918, your job is to finish the mission, is that so hard to do?
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;xm3(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:That's enough, Miss XM3... We completed our mission without a hitch, isn't that good enough?
SuperSASS(0);xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Without a hitch? You call what happened just now "completing the mission without a hitch"? +We messed up every step of the plan, there was no chain of command, and it was every Doll for herself out there! +The only reason we're here to point fingers at each other is because the opposition was even more worthless than we were!
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>;xm3(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:But... at least...
SuperSASS(0);xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Tell me, Super SASS. Who's responsible for what happened just now? +Why aren't you angry?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;xm3(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:XM3, don't talk to Super SASS like that.
xm3(0)<Speaker>XM3</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm not against dying for the mission, but what I hate more than anything is pointless effort, M1918. +If you want to continue slacking off, then go right ahead, but I hope you're not standing by my side, and I sure as hell hope you aren't my team leader!
()||<BIN>82</BIN>:...XM3 storms out of the room and slams the door shut behind her.
SuperSASS(0)<Speaker>Super SASS</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm sorry about this, Leader... +I'll try and talk to XM3 afterwards...
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:You don't need to apologize, really. +These things...they happen. It'll be fine once it blows over. +And perhaps... she has a point.

M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><BIN>82</BIN>:Why am I their leader...? Why? +I'm clearly outdated, and I'm just an old dog that can't learn new tricks... +Why won't they let me live in peace...
()||<BIN>82</BIN>:...Someone knocks on the dorm door.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Please come in.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Bonjour, Miss M1918. +I didn't see you on the range today, and someone said you would be here.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Sighs) What's this about?
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I've heard some... rumors, so I went out of my way to express my concern for a friend. Is that so strange?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Our team can handle our own affairs. We don't need the FN Team to look in on us. +Besides... I doubt you're enough of a do-gooder to come all this way for such a small thing, are you?
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:My, my. Alright then, I'll cut to the chase. +To put it simply, the deep reconnaissance teams have recovered some reliable information from the S.F. servers. It seems like they're going to be making some big movements.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Shouldn't the Commander be handling this sort of thing?
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:You are correct. +However, the team members suffered a vicious attack when recovering this information, which shows the S.F.'s attitude towards the matter. +Therefore, it is up to us to take the initiative and launch the first strike. The Commander hopes that this will reduce the variables in play.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:So why not ask some other Doll to do it? I'm not suitable for these high-difficulty missions anymore. +Each of the newcomers is more focused on the mission than the last, completely unlike me.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:We aren't lacking for people to go on the mission. +This is the location for our attack...
FN57(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:...Five-seven points at the electronic map.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Does this remind you of anything?
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Ah... +Nothing but bad memories... Has S.F. brought this base back online?
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Miss M1918, you're the one who knows that place best among all of us. +Many of us weren't even in Griffin when you first went to that place.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:A lot of Dolls quit after we captured that location... which is why our team is so underpowered. +Sometimes, you just can't understand the sheer difference without being there. +If I hadn't gone there... I wouldn't have learned that the battlefield had already made me obsolete.
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:And yet, you remained with Griffin.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:... +I was just... too lazy to write up my CV.
M1918(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Isn't that a good thing? We need you. +The FN Team needs your support, both your experience and your knowledge of that area.
M1918(0)<Speaker>M1918</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm sorry... but I'll have to say no. +Please leave this tired old woman be. Don't count on me to help you with anything. +Can't you just give me a break here?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏1>:I'll have to say no to that as well, Miss M1918. +That's because... I'm making you an offer that you can't refuse.
