()||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Late at night, in the Springfield Cafe. +There's a quiet knock on the cafe door.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:Please come in.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Evening, Springfield. Are you still open?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:... +Yes, we are. Would you like the usual coffee? Or would you like to order something else?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:No, the same old coffee will do.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hm, alright. Please give me a while.
()||:...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:......
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:♪～♬～♪
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Springfield...you're still the same as always.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Oh, don't talk like we've been separated forever. Here's your coffee.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Thank you, Springfield. +Hahaha, I knew it, this is how coffee should taste. I just can't get used to the stuff they serve in HQ's cafe.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I'll accept that as a compliment, then. ♪
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Or maybe it has to do with the person making it. After all, you don't make the coffee over at HQ. +Speaking of which... +...Springfield, why did you choose to work in a cafe?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Which answer would you like to hear?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Huh?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I could say that I was tired of it all, that I wanted a change of pace, that I wanted to learn to make coffee, or that I wanted to see everyone smile...but none of these are the answer you want, are they?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...I don't know what I want. +But I envy how you can be so self-assured and handle everything with ease...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I've got problems of my own and I get frustrated too, you know. But your situation now is more pressing, right? What happened?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Tokarev came to talk to me today, and afterwards I felt that she was right...but I don't know what to do now. +(Sighs) In any case, I'm just making more trouble for myself...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:While I don't know what she said to you, do you still care that much about your bloodline?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I used to think it was very important...but now... +I can't find a balance between embracing myself or others... +No matter what I do, I always feel like I did something wrong.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:That's because both sides are important to you, so you can't accept favoring one over the other, am I right?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Springfield... I think... I've fallen back into the same confusion I started with. +Kind of funny, right?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:If you can't pick one over the other... +... +Then what if you and everyone else each took a step back? Wouldn't that make things easier to accept?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Each of us taking a step back...? +But...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:Springfield withdraws a neural upgrade plan from her drawer and hands it to Mosin-Nagant.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:This schematic...isn't this...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Someone asked me to hand it to you..if you came here like you did just now.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:But aren't the contents...huh...? +...
()||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:This neural upgrade plan's been heavily revised. It's no longer so single-mindedly focused on improving combat effectiveness. +On the contrary, it's gone out of its way to preserve as many of the old parts as possible...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's...different? Did the Commander change it...? +But...why?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:It was because of Tokarev. +After she came back from HQ, she immediately roped everyone into writing a petition to the Commander. +It seems more people were willing to sign on than she expected.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:A petition...but why? For...for me? +But I don't understand, why did they have to...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:They all went up and asked the Commander to reconsider what the neural upgrade and your bloodline meant to you, in the hopes of changing the direction which the neural upgrade would take. +The Commander thought about it and agreed, which is why we have this revised plan. +Now the only thing left is whether or not you're willing to accept it. +Come back to us, everyone's finding it hard to adjust to the days without you around.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I... I...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:It's because you never gave up on others that others won't give up on you so easily. +So you'd better prepare yourself.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I... +Commander... +Everyone...
()||<黑屏1>:Tears roll down Mosin-Nagant's cheeks, splashing on the upgrade plan that's crumpled from how hard she's squeezing it.
