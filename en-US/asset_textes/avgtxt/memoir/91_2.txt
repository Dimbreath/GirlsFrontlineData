MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Sangvis Ferri dummies?! +Why...why are they here, and so many of them?! +This is bad! This is really bad! I need to get back and tell everyone!
()<Speaker>Calm Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>88</BIN>:The extent of the damage to the main door's smart lock was expected. +But the strength of those Griffin Dolls...was not.
强势的声音()<Speaker>Forceful Voice</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:I just don't understand why you're so insistent on wiping them out. They're just a bunch of kids, aren't they?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Huh...those voices are...
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM><BIN>88</BIN>:If only you hadn't been so slow, we could have wiped them out before they found us.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||<BIN>88</BIN>:Attacking kids goes against my principles. +Eliminating them did us no good, and it interfered with our mission.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Our mission is to start up this backup Dummy storehouse, so obviously it would be best to play it safe. +It would be troublesome if they managed to run back and report it to Griffin.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Start...start up?! +And everyone's already...?!
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Tsk, she sent us all this way to look for a backup warehouse that might not even exist... +What made Intruder so confident that it was here...?
BOSS-2(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Well, this used to be a Sangvis sub-plant, and the warehouse was sealed long ago. +It was very likely that the items remaining here would be in good condition.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:But was there a need to go to such lengths for a bunch of old Dummies?
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:In addition to the old Dummies, there are a lot of Goliath bombs further beneath that can still be used. +Those Griffin Dolls...they'll probably scatter like rats once they see the Goliaths.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:If the S.F. Dolls are activated...then everyone at the base will be in danger...! +...Ugh...! What should I do...? How did things end up like this...?
()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Humph, and if this surprise attack succeeds, won't Intruder steal the credit again?
()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Enough complaining. It looks like the Dummies mothballed here are in good shape. +Get to the control room. Once they're connected to the command network, it's no longer our business.
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:...Executioner's and Scarecrow's voices fade into the distance.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:(Whimpers) Don't tell me P7, C96 and M1919 are all... +This is bad...but it's too late for me to run now... I need to stop S.F.! +But...how did things end up like this...? +If only there was someone else here... If only...
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:...MP-446 peers nervously at the Dummy body beside her.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:... +...C96?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Can I call you C96?
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:...MP-446 pulls off the Dummy's head.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>:... +......+...This is terrible! Listen to me, C96! +S.F. just snuck in here, and if they activate the Dummies, the base will be in danger! +...That's right! We mustn't be scared of them! We've got to stop them!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
MP-446()<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Those S.F. Dolls said that there were lots of Goliath bombs further below... +Yeah, M1919, I know. If we can bring them up here and detonate them, we'll be able to destroy these Dummies! +So we'll be able to find those bombs if we head further down...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN><黑屏2>:(Whimpers) It's so dark...+How far down does this go...? +No! I'm not scared! +Good thing you're all here! I'm at ease as long as everyone's around! +Quit laughing, C96, if you were here you'd pee your pants in fright too...er...no, wait, I mean, your skirt...er...hang on...
()||<BIN>47</BIN>:...MP-446 takes a while to think about C96's clothes.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:Forget it! In any case, let's carry on!
()||:...MP-446 hugs the Dummy head. +Eventually, she reaches a door labelled "Caution! Mobile! Explosive!"
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>47</BIN>:"Explosive"... This must be it, right? +I wasn't followed...so they probably didn't spot me...
()||<BIN>47</BIN><黑屏1>:MP-446 looks back anxiously into the darkness. She tries to listen for any sound, but she can only hear her own breathing. +Then, she pushes the door open.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2>:(Whimpers) If I'd known, I wouldn't have looked back, all it did was make me more worried... +It's all your fault, C96! Er...why are there so many Goliaths here...? And they're all painted red, what's with that... +Although, if I can get one upstairs... +Even if I can't wreck all the Dummies, at least the base should hear the sound of the explosion...
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>88</BIN>:Your plan is so full of flaws I don't even know where to begin.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><BIN>88</BIN>:Whoa! +What-what are you doing here?!
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Since when were you under the impression that I had not found you? +I really am quite curious. Oh well, it's not like it's that important. Nice to meet you. Now die.
()<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Aaaaaaahhhhh!
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:...Huh?
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:...Scarecrow reaches out to grab MP-446, but she is hit by the Dummy head that MP-446 throws at her. +MP-446 takes advantage of the opening to dive into the pile of Goliaths.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||<BIN>88</BIN>:How's that! Bet you don't dare open fire, do you! +If you miss, this whole place will go "Boom!" +So come on, shoot me! Shoot me! Come on!
MP446(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:...I can rip you to shreds with my bare hands.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Come have a go if you're so tough! +Watch this!
()||<BIN>88</BIN>:MP-446 picks up a Goliath beside her and throws it at Scarecrow. +At the same time, she hugs another one to herself.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN>:Hm... I anticipated this level of resistance. It's useless.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏1>2</黑屏1>:As if I'm going to fight you! Dumbass! +So long! Moron! Goodbye!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>2</黑屏2><黑屏1>:Still holding the red Goliath in her arms, MP-446 slips through a gap and runs past Scarecrow. +She runs into the jet-black passage again, toward the S.F. Dummy storage warehouse.
