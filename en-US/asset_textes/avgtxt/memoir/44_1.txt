SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hm... +Given the height difference here, and the fact that we're 240m above sea level, if I fired down...
SV98(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:SV-98 slides her finger along the touchscreen as she checks the map on the tablet in front of her.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Muttering to herself)  That would be equivalent to roughly 850m in a straight line... + (Copies notes) The weather forecast predicts a humidity of 60%, while the temperature is...
SV98(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Are you doing math problems again?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Ah, it's you, SVD...
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:It's just a standard patrol mission, there's no need to be so paranoid. +Even if there are enemies, they're probably nothing more than some third-rate S.F. maggots.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:We still need to prepare.
SV98(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:SVD leans in closer for a look.
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:So, what kind of preparations are you making?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I found a few positions on the map that could be potential sniping spots. +I need to calculate the exact distance to targets in each direction for each of those positions.
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Huh~ That's pretty hardworking of you, but don't you think you're kind of wasting your effort?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:H-how can you say that?! +You need to plan ahead in order to shoot accurately and effectively!
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:This battlefield has heavy vegetation and the terrain is very uneven. +While there are a lot of elevated locations that can serve as shooting platforms, there are lots of blind spots as well. +Why not wait until tomorrow and decide where to set up rather than worry yourself for nothing now?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:It's because there's so many uncertain elements about the battlefield that we need to eliminate as many of them as possible before the mission starts!
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:(Sighs) Why are there stubborn nerd Dolls like you... +Listen, a real elite doesn't waste her effort on pointless things like this. +For instance, I only channel my efforts in meaningful directions.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:But—
SV98(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:We've got a mission tomorrow. Have you got too much space in your neural cloud? You think it doesn't need clearing up? Is that why you still aren't going to sleep? +Or do I hear someone volunteering to stay up all night to wake me up tomorrow?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:L-Leader...
SV98(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:It's good that you're passionate about your mission and your work. Frankly speaking, I wasn't planning to turn in on time either. +But AK-47's already asleep, so if you want to discuss operational planning, would you mind taking the others into consideration as well?
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:That's all from me. Goodnight, my adorable little junior.
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Are you alright? Would you like some tea? Or perhaps coffee?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:No, it's alright. +I just feel that if you want to score a bullseye, you have to put in an appropriate amount of work.
SV98(0);OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Well, I don't want to see my team members overstrain themselves and end up failing to show their stuff when the time comes. +...In any case, you should get some rest. There's still a lot of time until we set out tomorrow night. You can calmly work out your plans then.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;OTs14(0)||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:...Roger, Leader!
