()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Click. +The transmission ends.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:So what are you planning to do after this?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We're going to finish the mission she gave us, as always. The rest isn't my concern.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Ah, alright then. I thought you wouldn't be getting any new jobs... As it happens, there are a few new things I wanted to try recently.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:New things? You're not going to make us your guinea pigs again, are you? +What if you install a module that makes me explode the moment I open fire? How terrifying!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:What the hell are you talking about?! Do you still doubt my skills even after we've worked together for so long?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't worry, he wouldn't dare. After all, Dier's livelihood depends on us.+You don't need to worry either, Dier. We'll have a lot of work for you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 turns to the other Dolls and flashes them her usual smile.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ladies, after this, we'll be heading up to Tallinn for a stroll.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hah? Tallinn?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We're traveling across half the continent?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why do we have to go to such a faraway place...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Our client's arranged a simple and enjoyable hike in the great outdoors for us.+We can't always be cooped up in the safe house, you know. It's true that we ought to go out and interact more with the friendly inhabitants of the outside world.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...I remember what's near that place.+So, are you really going to take us out to dance on the edge of Hell?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The place we're going has never been much of a tourist spot... And as for whether it's Hell or a swamp, you'll find out once we arrive.+Since you know what's over there, I doubt you'll refuse, isn't that right, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:In that case, does anyone else have any questions?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:When are we heading out?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:In 48 hours. We don't have enough supplies here, so I'll need to head over to the other safe house in a bit.+Make sure you are more than fully prepared, everyone; we have a long journey ahead of us.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why do we have to go so far away all of a sudden...+Can't we rest a little longer?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You can take an extra pillow if you carry it yourself.+Now get up!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Whimpers)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Dolls of Squad 404 leave the workshop and begin outfitting themselves.+During this time, UMP9 heads to the maintenance room by herself.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:... +Dier?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:What is it? Need something? +All the batteries are on the shelves. +If you want anti-jamming equipment—
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm not talking about those. +Dier, can you do me a favor before we head out?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Eh?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it's very simple!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Fine, let's hear it. +But let me get this out of the way first, if I say I can't do it, that means I really can't do it, okay?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Danke! +We'll talk as we walk.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>70</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:While I'm in charge of servicing and maintaining you girls in the first place, this is still a very difficult request for me to fill.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Why is that? +It's just adding a few upgrade modules...that should be easy for you, right?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:It's not that I don't understand what you're asking for. +But your modification plans have already been finalized, and we don't have much time... If I make big alterations to them now, it's very likely to cause problems!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Which is why I said we have to hurry up and get started! +In my case, I just need to improve my electronic infiltration capabilities a little. That way, I can...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Can help UMP45? +I'd advise you not to set such a high bar for yourself... The fundamental differences between the two of you aren't something that a simple modification can address.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:That's why I came to you for help. +I can't think of anything, but I believe you must have some way to do it!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Even if you place your faith in my skills, I can't do what I can't do. +Also, does 45 know what you're planning?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:She...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:See? The request you just made isn't as simple as regular maintenance. It's basically revamping you from the inside out.+Shouldn't you tell her about this sort of thing beforehand? If something goes wrong, your neural cloud might really explode the moment you pull the trigger like you said, you know?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But...there's no time...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:That's why—
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Your little argument is quite interesting.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Oops...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...45.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Since Dier doesn't want to help, it would be rude to keep pestering him, 9.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Whew...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:After all, Young Master Dier is in a rush to return to his family's luxurious mansion...isn't he?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Oi, you...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ah, was I mistaken? Sorry about that. +You looked so happy just now that I thought you'd finally decided to give up your life of being ordered around by other people.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Are you doing this on purpose? +I know what freedom means just as well as you do.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Correct, but haven't you dreamt about the past before? +Of those comfortable days, when you were served by Dolls.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:... +...Ah!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I'm not interested in that kind of thing. +Whatever my past was, it has nothing to do with who I am now.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Does that include picking up a cute Doll by chance and bringing her home?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Eh? Didn't we agree not to mention—
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:While I'm not exactly sure what Young Master Dier likes about that particular model...
UMP9(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Maybe it's how she naps all the time, which implies that she's obedient and low-maintenance.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:That would make sense. +It's a strange thing to like her for, but Young Master Dier really does like her. +In fact, he even went and studied up on A-Doll technology on his own just for her sake.
UMP9(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But cruel, cruel, Young Master Dier just said that he didn't care about his past any more.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Ah, what a shame.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Even after he has soooo many other Dolls of the same model in his own home serving as his maids—
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<震屏>:STOP IT!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But I guess...not many people know about this, am I right? +I mean, if the fans of the "Almighty Mechanic" found out...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:(Whimpers)
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I mean, it's perfectly normal for girls to pick up strange rumors in this day and age, don't you think?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I think so too.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:How can you DO this?!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, let's not worry about that for now. +Dier, could you do me a favor before we head out?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ugh... +...+ (Sighs) Come with me, we don't have much time.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>22</BIN><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:This place is...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I don't like bringing people into my personal lab, but the run-down facilities in the safe house won't be able to handle what I'm about to do. +Humph...so much for a "simple request", you're all devils trying to squeeze me dry!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Um...will it hurt?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:"Will it hurt?" Just turn off your sensory modules! +But there's no need for that either. I'll shut down your neural cloud's Level II activity. +Your consciousness will settle down to the Level III base layer. I don't know what's going to happen then.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So...it'll actually be like taking a nap?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Yeah, you'll go to sleep and wake up fully upgraded, you'll have no idea exactly how hard SOME people were working during that time.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Danke schön, Dier. +I'll make it up to you out of my allowance.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Don't thank me just yet. +I have to warn you — I wasn't lying when I was talking about hard it is to get you up to UMP45's level, given the capabilities of your body.+Even this upgrade now is pushing it, and I can't rule out the possibility of unexpected side-effects cropping up.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:... +That's fine.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hah? How can you be fine with that?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +I...accidentally peeked into 45's memories once...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:So what did you see? Corpses everywhere?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN>:Once, there was a Doll...who spent a long time by 45's side. +They were very close, and she was very important to 45. She was so important that 45 refused to change her body in order to preserve her memories of her. +I know that no matter what I do, I'll never be able to come anywhere near. +But at least... At the very least, I want to do my best and draw closer.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...+<size=30>But I'm the one who's putting in all the hard work here.</size>
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Dier...that's why...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:You can save the flattery. I don't need it right now, anyway. +Just figure out what exactly you want.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Mm...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Let's begin, then. Goodnight.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><白屏2><黑屏1>:
