()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...That night. +In the corner of a deserted street.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin and OTs-12 lie in wait in the shadows, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:See that? That pillar behind the shrubbery at 2 o'clock is their sensor. If we enter within its scanning range, we'll trigger the alarm.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I spotted another one at 9 o'clock! +These sensors seem to be spread out around the perimeter of their outpost.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:You're right. It's going to be a bit tricky, but we now have the analysis of the recon data that we've collected...
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Line after line of codes flash on the tactical tablet in Stechkin's hand. +She then connects her own sensor to the tablet and gestures to OTs-12.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Set up a connection yourself. Good thing I had the foresight to bring a signal masker along. +You've also noticed, haven't you? The base that we're about to infiltrate...
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:OTs-12 nods solemnly.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Da, it's Sangvis Ferri. +I thought we'd already rooted out all the S.F. in this area, but this must've slipped through our purge.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑点1>:98%... Great, this should do the trick. +According to the topographical reconstruction, there's a large holographic rock behind the garage. Judging by the shape, it is most definitely their storage unit. +I can't read the supply crate from this distance, so we'll have to get closer for a better scan. +Watch for my signal and advance according to the plotted route. I'll cover you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><黑点1>:Stechkin gives OTs-12 these instructions in a hushed voice. +With their signals camouflaged, the duo successfully slip past the Sangvis sensors without being intercepted by the enemy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><Night><黑点2>:OTs-12 feels her way to the side of the garage and creeps toward the corner. Then she incapacitates a dinergate near the holographic rock with an electric shock.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:All clear. Follow me.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1><SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Copy that.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><Night><黑点2>:By the time Stechkin catches up, OTs-12 has already finished scanning the storage unit. +Stechkin casts a routine glance at the display of OTs-12's scanner. Her eyes widen almost imperceptibly.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:It's a match. The lost supplies that we're after are all in this storage unit. +Stechkin, your saving plan seems to be getting off to a good start!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Why are you so excited? You don't usually talk this much on missions.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Well, this time...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Right, leave that till we're safely back in the base. Start cracking the code. I'll watch your back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OTs-12 gives a swift nod and starts unlocking the storage unit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Click. +Beep beep...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:The soft digital blips are swept up by the night breeze, but there is suddenly an ominous sense of disquiet in the air.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<震屏><闪屏><duration>5</duration><rate>10</rate></闪屏><白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2><黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tinnitus</SE1>:Pzzzzzt!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:The sensors in OTs-12's hand starts crackling. With an explosion, a large cloud of smoke billows out from the rock. +Stechkin manages to drag OTs-12 behind herself just in time.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Ka-chak.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:The duo brace themselves for an attack from directly ahead and find a pair of fluorite green eyes staring back at them.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You knew we were here?!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:A true hunter knows the importance of remaining silent. +Only stupid prey like you would hop so eagerly into a trap.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Tsk. This Dummy hasn't forgotten her pretentious lines.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang! Bang bang bang...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Not wanting to waste her breath talking to Hunter, Stechkin opens fire without warning. +OTs-12 matches her pace and also starts attacking Hunter.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Tiss, retreat!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin barks out a command, but to her surprise, OTs-12 neither breaks off her attack nor shows any sign of wanting to retreat. +Instead...she presses on with all her might. Though her shots barely deal any meaningful damage to Hunter, she still manages to force open a path to her side.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As more smoke begins to spread, OTs-12 takes off with Stechkin in tow. +Once behind cover, her neural cloud whirs into action and starts formulating a battle plan.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Stechkin, go and—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:Stechkin slaps OTs-12's hand away and glares angrily at her while she reloads.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What the hell was that? Why didn't you do as I said?!
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:The reward for this mission is too good to pass up. I've got to stay... +It'll be a lot riskier if we retreat together, Stechkin, so you go on first! I'll cover you! +Luckily, this is just one of Hunter's Dummies. I should be able to handle her. I have a secret weapon up my sleeve...
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin pauses for a moment.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:What secret weapon? You think you can beat it on your own? Don't be stupid! +Even if it's just a Dummy, it's still a Dummy of the most adept pursuer in Sangvis Ferri! +You're going to stay behind? Do you want to be shredded alive?!
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:But these supplies!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:I saw the designation on your scanner. These... +...Are the supplies that I stole and sold to the black market before. That's why...change of plans! Abort the mission and retreat at once! +I'll just pay Kalina back in full when we get back!
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:N-no...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Do you have a death wish?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Their cover is just a piece of rubble and will soon succumb to Hunter's barrage. +OTs-12 sets her jaw grimly and concentrates on returning fire. Stechkin rarely sees her so resolved.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:I don't know if you still remember that one recon mission. We were also pinned down by S.F.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunkill</SE2>:Bang bang! +Stechkin gives no reply, but OTs-12 isn't expecting one and just carries on.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:You covered my escape, and when our follow-up units brought you back to the base afterwards, you left hand was completely shattered.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:I don't remember that. Even if it did happen, I did it for the bonus of keeping all team members alive, not for you.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I know, I know you did it for the bonus... +But I don't care. The simple fact is that you did save me, and I don't want to owe you any favors.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Does that really matter?
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Yes, it does to me... +As your teammate, I have to find a way to repay you... +If I am to perish at the hands of Hunter right here, then that's our score settled, and I won't owe you anything. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang! +Bang bang bang...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin does not reply. She just focuses on clearing out the troopers that are pouring out to flank them.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Stechkin. I seem to have caused a setback in your plan to save up... +If I manage to return with the supplies, you can have the whole sum of the reward. +After all, I seldom get a chance to do something for my friend...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Another lunging dinergate collapses at Stechkin's feet. +Stechkin takes out a small brick of explosives from her backpack and places it right next to OTs-12.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Alright... Then as you wish, you don't owe me a thing.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As OTs-12 bears the brunt of Hunter's assault all by herself, Stechkin finds an opening and slips out of the enemies' range.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's good... +This is...as it should be...
