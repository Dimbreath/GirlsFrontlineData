80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Nothing to do... Today is another boooooring day. +When do we get to fight some Sangvis...?
()||:...Type 80 notices a group of T-Dolls gathered around.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:What's going on here?
()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||:Hush... A miracle is happening.
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Do you know what you've done wrong?
FairyWarrior(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Warrior Fairy</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:We shouldn't have zoomed around like that...
FairyTaunt(0)<Position>0,250</Position><Speaker>Taunt Fairy</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:Sorry, Miss Gr G3... It was our fault.
G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:It's alright as long as you're aware of that. +I know you were excited, but don't get TOO excited. Be careful next time.
()||:...The Fairies head off.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||:Gr G3...? +No... You seem...different? +Is this the consequence of making you perform maintenance on the Fairy system...?
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Not exactly... +I changed...because I met the Fairy Queen.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:The Fairy Queen? Sounds like some new bubble gum flavor... +Say, Gr G3...are you sure you're alright?
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:I'm fine, and the Fairy Queen does exist. +Though she often goes missing...when running away from the rats in our warehouse.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:This queen sounds very unreliable... +But what has she got to do with how you've changed?
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Well, she's taught me a lot about how to get along with people...and Fairies. +She also suggested some technical upgrades for me to give me more "spunk".
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:Oh? And the Commander endorsed the upgrade?
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Since it would increase my effectiveness in carrying out missions that include Fairy maintenance, ja. The Commander agreed to it just like that.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:I see... +You looked a bit intimidating just now, but you still sound like the usual Gr G3...
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Old habits die hard, I suppose. +(Whispers) The Commander even asked me for an audience with the Fairy Queen, saying there's a lot of wishes to be made.
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>;G3Mod(0)||:Even the Commander believes in her... +Since when are there such things at the base...?
80type(0);G3Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G3</Speaker>||:Do you want to meet her too, Type 80?
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Sounds like trouble, so I'll pass. +I'll just think of it as an urban legend.
()||<黑屏2>:...
80type(0)<Speaker>Type 80</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That said, Gr G3 has really changed a lot... +Who exactly is this Fairy Queen...? +I hope she wasn't tricked by something strange...?
