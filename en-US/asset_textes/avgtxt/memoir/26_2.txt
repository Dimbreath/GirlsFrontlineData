()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2>:...Morning, at the Griffin base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls passing by the HQ block might have heard a muffled voice — one which sounds somewhat delighted. +Meanwhile, XM8, who is squatting downstairs, has a look of disbelief on her face.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:What was that just now? Did someone just say... +"Thank you, Commander"...? +Don't tell me the Commander actually agreed and threw that shorty onto the battlefield...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as XM8 starts muttering to herself, the shorty in question runs down the stairs.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:XM8! Did you know? The Commander just said—
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:—That you could go onto the battlefield?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5's face shows no sign of annoyance at being interrupted.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Yup! An operation in the war zone came up at the last minute! +Normally, the Commander would've given it to Master, but Master already went out on a mission in the morning, so—!
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Alright, I get it, it's been assigned to you instead, the low-spec version of Thompson.
XM8(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Don't keep calling me that! Even if I AM a lower-spec version of Master, I've absorbed the secrets of her teachings over the course of my training! +And the Commander also said that based on the data, I ought to be able to handle it! +Although, the Commander sounded a bit hesitant about telling me something... Eh, anyway, it probably wasn't important!
XM8(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 shakes her head.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:I don't know why, but I think I can imagine what exactly the Commander tried — and failed — to get out...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 tilts her head and looks at XM8, then she regains the look of excitement with which she had left the HQ block.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I'll take a rain check on this game of chess! I'll make it up to you when I get back! +I'm finally going to have a chance to show everyone what Master taught me—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 doesn't immediately respond to what Gr MP5 said. Instead, she falls silent for a moment.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Look, Gr MP5, actually... +Forget it...just come back in one piece.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gr MP5 never managed to decipher the complex blend of emotions on XM8's face that morning. +Her rushed schedule does not permit her much time for pondering the matter, and by the time Gr MP5 revisits those words, the shells are already going off all around her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...In the war zone. +Amidst the city ruins.
MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏>:Dammit! XM8, you jinx!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbang! Bangbangbang—!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Let's fall back for now! These reinforcements that suddenly turned up are a little hard to handle... +We need to reorganize ourselves and send a report back to base!
MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:A-Alright! +You guys go first! I...I'll use my skill, I'll be fine...!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Urgh... Don't push yourself too hard! +Everyone! We're relocating to the ruins at 8 o'clock! Mind yourselves and listen to my orders!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN><黑屏2>:... +Under P99's leadership, Gr MP5 and her team members find cover, taking a brief moment to catch their breath amidst the never-ending hail of gunfire. +Gr MP5 sits in a corner, looking at her scorched skin and the singed hems of her dress. She can't keep her tears from falling.
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Gr MP5... +Don't worry, I've already contacted the base. The Commander says we can withdraw to a safe point about a kilometer away. +Our intelligence was flawed, so the danger rating of this mission has been upgraded to an S rank, which means... +All we have to do now is wait in a safe place to hand things over to our replacements.
P99(0);MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I...I didn't expect the fighting to be so intense...
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>;MP5(1)||:That's not your fault...
P99(0);MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I even went and ran my mouth to XM8 and the Commander about how strong I was... +This is just so embarrassing!
P99(0);MP5(1)||:
()||:P99 adjusts her glasses and smiles helplessly.
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>;MP5(1)||:Don't be like that. It's not like you're weak either, Gr MP5. +At the very least, every time I return to my room after a mission I always run into you coming back from the range, Gr MP5. +You've already worked very hard, so don't be so hard on yourself.
P99(0);MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:B-But if Master were here, she wouldn't have let things end up this way!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>;MP5(1)||:(Sighs) You've always had that problem.
P99(0);MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Huh?
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Miss Thompson is Miss Thompson, but you are you, Gr MP5.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 falls silent. Her expression flickers rapidly; even P99 is unable to tell what she is thinking.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Just as she is about to speak, a loud explosion comes from outside the ruins.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:BOOM—!
MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:W-What happened?
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:...! +Oh no! We can't let the enemy block our path of retreat! +Everyone, listen up, we're going to stage a breakout!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Intense cannon fire blasts through the run-down walls that provide the team with shelter. It flings debris through the smoke-filled air, which slashes past the Dolls' bodies like flying razor blades.+Gr MP5 staggers to her feet and reflexively moves in front of her teammates.+The return fire from Gr MP5 and her teammates in this unevenly-matched battle is like a wisp of smoke disappearing into the night sky, completely drowned out by their opposition.
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Ladies, mind yourselves! I'm activating my skill, so fall back as quickly as you can!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P99 stands behind Gr MP5 as she directs the other team members while opening communications to the command post to verify the coordinates of the unit taking over from them. +It's probably because they've been roommates and battle buddies for so long that P99 senses something amiss about Gr MP5 amidst the furious gunfire.
MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) If only I were as strong as Master... +If I can hold out against the next wave of attacks, everyone will be safe!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:What are you babbling about, Gr MP5?! Don't just stand there, RUN!
MP5(1)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I need to be stronger...like Master... +If I can just soak up all the attacks...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Even Gr MP5 doesn't know if she mumbled those words to herself or if she shouted them at the last moment. +By the time she realizes it, all that remains is the sound of explosions, interspersed with the sound of her teammates calling out to her.
