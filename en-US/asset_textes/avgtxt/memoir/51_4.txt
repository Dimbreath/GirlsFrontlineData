FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><黑点2>:Sigh. FF FN49 didn't come back today either... +She didn't even tell me when she left. What on earth is she up to? +Now that I think about it...she's been avoiding me these days. +But we have no reason to fight anymore, so why...?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker> </Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:...The door rattles.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hmm? The door is locked? +What are you still doing here, FF FNC?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:It's 49! You're back! I'll get the door!
FN-49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Seriously... +I heard 57 had arranged a training session for you today... Are you ditching again?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Just sneaking off occasionally. You know me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:...FF FNC opens the door.
FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I know we're supposed to help each other out, but 57 is asking about you every day. I can only make so many excuses here...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hmm...?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||<BIN>82</BIN><震屏>:Huhhhhhhhh??!! +FF FN49! What...what the heck happened to you?!
FNFNC(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Heheh, you like it? +The Commander had filed me in for a Neural Upgrade because of my satisfactory performance recently! +I'd actually learned about it a long time ago, but I wanted to give you a surprise so I never told you.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:So THIS is why you've been missing for days! +That's unfair! Not only are you stronger, even your clothes look nicer... +I'm already the short one. Now you're gonna be getting ALL the attention!
FNFNC(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:If you don't want to be overshadowed, you'd better start training hard. +If you do well, you could very well be recommended for the upgrade, too.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Huh? Shouldn't you be more benevolent after the Neural Upgrade?! +It's fine as long as you're here even if I slack off a bit, right?
FNFNC(0);FN49Mod(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:No can do. +If you want to keep up with me, then GET. UP. THIS. INSTANT. +You see this hair brush? It's a symbol of our friendship... +However, if you slack off, it'll turn into a whip to beat you into shape!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49Mod(0)||<黑点1><BIN>82</BIN>:Whoaaaaaaa! +Spare meeeeeee, 49! Nooooooooooo!!
()||<BIN>18</BIN><黑点2>:Outside the dorm room.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏1>:My, FF FN49 really has learned a thing or two... +She's even developed a menacing side... +Oh dear... Poor FF FNC. Friendship really is something one needs to cultivate with caution.
