NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:What? You don't want it replaced? This tattered rag of a body? +Are you serious? Has your neural cloud fried as well after taking that shell?
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The logistic officer from Griffin has restored my basic power supply. It isn't entirely necessary to discard this body, right? +The two of you... are the most skilled experts I know. +I don't care how much it'll cost. Name your price.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Haha, you sure know how to talk big! +When it's over, I'll write you a bill that'll wipe that smirk right off your face, and I only take cash!
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:That's enough, Dier! +Um... he doesn't mean any harm, please forgive him. But as Dier has said, your body has suffered extensive damage. +As a unit meant for electronic warfare, it is more encumbered to begin with. Coupled with the physical mutilation, a full recovery is practically impossible. +Not to mention, the equipment and parts we have here are...
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't expect to return to my original state, but I MUST retain this body no matter what. +For... personal reasons.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hey, jokes aside, I really won't hold back when I settle the accounts with you. +You have utterly no idea how much of a pain that body of yours is. Your model is not in use at all in the market, and replacement parts that match you 100% are hard to come by. Do you realize how difficult it is for me to perform maintenance on you as is? +Even if we had the parts, look at how bashed up you are. Even if we don't replace your body, your stumps have to go!
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Go ahead. If it's just an arm and a leg...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:You think it's that easy?! The parts for the DSI-8 model have been discontinued long ago! Besides, your body has undergone drastic alterations. Where am I supposed to find an arm that conforms to your body?
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You tell me. Aren't you always boasting about how you're the most gifted genius mechanic?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Tsk... There is a way... I have a few old kits in my depot. I COULD use them to patch you up with some adjustment. +However, I've never tried that before, and if the compatibility is not up to standard, they'll contaminate your control system. That isn't usually a problem - all it takes is some fixes on the low-level code in the control sequence and a reboot. +But in your current state, if the reboot fails, I'm afraid your consciousness will be deadlocked in Level III, making it virtually impossible to backup your neural cloud.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I understand. Do it your way.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Dammit... have you thrown all caution to the wind?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:Miss 45... um, I suggest we backup your neural cloud before we proceed. If the repair goes south, we can still transfer the backup to another body. I will prepare a body with much better specs than your current one... so—
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Danke, Sier. I appreciate the kind thought... +But if I leave this body, I won't be me anymore. A me like that has no reason to exist...
UMP45(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 sighs.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm fully prepared. After all, this body is defective to begin with. It wouldn't be strange if it just broke down without warning. +As for the others waiting outside... please explain the situation to them. +If I never regain consciousness, transfer my command authorizations to 416... If she isn't there, hand them over to 9. +If it comes to that, 9 will most likely be a bit... "emotional". Please take care to comfort her.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hey, are you... really ready to say goodbye?
NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:I understand... Miss UMP45 is bound and determined. I suppose nothing we say will change her mind.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Fine, fine. The decision is yours. +I've established the connection. Syncing you up with the maintenance station. I can't guarantee anything, but I'll do my best.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Danke, Dier. I trust you.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:As I said, it's gonna cost you big time. +Now, to prepare for the refit, I'm gonna sever all your control authorizations. You're going to be stuck in Level III for a bit.
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Okay... I'm ready. +...Do it!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then, 3, 2, 1, begin!

()||:...A long time seems to have elapsed.
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Where... am I? +It's pitch black. I can't see anything... or touch anything.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:After taking stock of what she can make out, UMP45's gaze falls on her right side. +She notices her dismembered right arm is attached to her body, safe and whole.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:So this is Level III...? There's nothing here. What a dreadful place... +Looks like Dier and Sier really have their work cut out for them this time. +But it's hardly a surprising ending if I never wake up. +...Hmm?
()||:UMP45's attention is attracted by several white orbs that whisk past her from behind. +She feels herself sinking and realizes that these orbs flitting by are bubbles. It finally occurs to her that she seems to be having a nonsensical dream here on the bottom layer of cyberspace. +She attempts to magnify the bubbles' resolution and is surprised to see images on them. +The cannon of a tank pointing in her direction. +416 cursing loudly. +A giant dinergate dashing about. +Gr G11 looking apprehensive at the prospect of being left behind. +A Sangvis mortar making an ear-splitting sound on the snow field. +9 raising her arm in enthusiastic agreement. +... +A right hand extended to her when she's covering her injured left eye and weeping.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Probably the self-diagnostic again... +Scheiße! Can't I shut it down? They just keep flashing by... +All these useless things are taking up too much space... Just accessing these memories puts a lot of strain on my neural cloud.
()||:In no particular chronological order, with no regard to how much impression they leave, a large amount of memory-bubbles surge past her and rise upward. +UMP45, completely paralyzed, just keeps sinking.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I didn't know my neural cloud was so messy. Looks like I really should find some time to organize it. +But even if I want to, I don't know where to start. If I survive this, I'll ask Dier and Sier.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But who designed a program interface like... oww!
()||<震屏>:After sinking for who-knows-how long, she feels her back slamming into something hard. +At the same time, her limbs are no longer paralyzed.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Have I reached the bottom? That means the program has finally run its course.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:UMP45 lifts herself on all fours, then stands up at the bottom of the cyber-ocean.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hallo, 45!
()||:Hearing the sound from behind, UMP45 raises her weapon instinctively. As she tries to move her finger onto the trigger, she realizes that she isn't actually armed. +After all, this is just a dream. There is no need for weapons here. +But her usual firearm slowly appears in her once-empty hand. +She finds that a bit odd, but figures it out at once. +After all, this is just a dream. No need to think too much of it.
()||<SE1>Reload</SE1>:She clutches the pistol grip lightly, turns around, and aims the gun at the source of the voice.
()||<震屏>:But the moment her eye locks onto the target, the image through the sight flickers out of focus.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Welcome back.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...?! +You... you're...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:We agreed, didn't we? One day, we'll go somewhere far away; we'll look upon the same ocean together; we'll enjoy the sunshine and a carefree vacation. +Or have you forgotten all about it?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Hold on, this isn't right. Impossible... +W-who the hell are you...?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Whatever are you talking about, 45? Why ask such an obvious question? +You know the answer very well.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I...
()||:"...would recognize her anywhere." +But UMP45's vocal module seems to be malfunctioning. No matter how hard she tries, she just can't say the name out loud. +After all, this is just a dream...right?
