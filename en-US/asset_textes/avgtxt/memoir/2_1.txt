M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hmm... Our combat data this month are about the same as last month. +If I can improve them next month, I'm sure Darling would like that.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:What are you doing, M1911?
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Analyzing our combat data this month.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Oh? Let me see!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm not done yet. I'll send it out to all of you once it's ready.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:It doesn't hurt if I take a peek now, does it? +You know what, I'm taking it myself!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN><震屏>:Hey, don't just snatch it from me!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:You're always so willful. The Commander might just get pissed off with you for that.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:The Commander is very fond of me. Whatever are you talking about? +Hmm...let me look at this week's performance ranking... +Ooooh! I ranked higher than you, M1911.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:You merely out-damaged me a little.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:So you do realize how much shorter you measure up against me, eh? +Then stop hanging around the Commander so much!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Pardon??
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:You've been in service for quite a while now. Isn't it time you moved to the backline? +Only new and glamorous T-Dolls like me are suited to be by the Commander's side.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:You're only that much newer than myself! +Besides, I don't care about other things, but I won't easily let go of my Darling's love!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:The position of the Commander's adjutant isn't determined by youth, but by performance.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Humph. My performance is still better than yours!
M1928A1()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Don't be so sure about that, M9.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:No point in talking big before we have results from actual combat.
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:M-Miss Thompson?! Since when...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I just overheard you talking while passing by. +Firepower is only part of your performance... +You should at least understand that much if you're as mighty as you claim to be.
M1928A1(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Yes, ma'am... +But Miss Thompson, I am better than M1911 in many things! +You just have to let me prove it!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I look forward to it. +As for now, I think you should return to your room and wait for the official analysis to be completed.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏1>:M9 nods and leaves the common room.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:Thanks for helping me out back there, Thompson. Sorry for the trouble.
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Don't mention it... +Though even a softie like you should lose your temper every once in a while.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Well, well... That's not exactly my forte.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Besides, I AM an old model... Sometimes my body does betray me.
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:So you're backing down?
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>82</BIN><震屏>:Of course not! +How could I just let go after that romantic encounter with the Commander?
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Haha, thought so. +Still, you gotta find a way to settle your dispute with M9... +It this goes on, it could some day get in the way of our operation.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:You're right, Thompson...
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏1>:Maybe it's time I lost my temper.
