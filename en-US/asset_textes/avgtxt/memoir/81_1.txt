()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...In the afternoon. +In the Griffin base. +Inside the Doll dorms.
()||:Though it's a holiday, the monthly cleaning of the Griffin dorms makes it look like its occupants are preparing for war.+As usual, M60 walks up to the room next door by force of habit and pokes her head inside.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||:Yo, Mk48, have you assigned everyone's duties yet?
M60(0);Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Oh, if it isn't, M60.+I've handed them out for the time being... Although, you should take a look at this.
M60(0);Mk48(0)<Grey>||:
()||:Mk48 shrugs as she leans against her mop. Then she tilts her head in the direction of the room, indicating that M60 should take a look.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||:Tsk...she's always like this on this day of every month.
()||:Inside the room, FF M249SAW is sprawled on her bed with a plush toy in her arms and a wad of gum in her mouth.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:Is M60 here?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She greets M60 nonchalantly and gets up. Still chewing her gum, she squeezes through the two Dolls.+M60 can't take it anymore and calls out to her.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;M249SAW(0)||:Hey, they're going to rate the comfort level of our dorm, you know...?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:I've already swept up my part. +I'll leave the rest to you guys... (Yawns) I'm so sleepy...
()||:M60 turns to Mk48 and shoots her a sympathetic look. Mk48 nods back in silent acknowledgement.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:It can't be helped. That's just the way she is, and we're used to it. +Besides, we've got LWMMG here, so SAW's been spoilt rotten by her.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Hm? Talking about me?
()||:The sudden interjection startles Mk48 and M60. +LWMMG is standing near the dorm entrance, carrying two pails of water. Her face is placid, as usual.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker><Shake>||:You...you scared the crap out of me, Lem. +Speaking of which, your SAW skipped out on cleaning again, shouldn't you be keeping her in line?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...I told you not to call me that. +And it doesn't matter. Work needs to be done, and since it doesn't matter who does it, it won't make a difference if I do it.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||:Like I was saying, you kids have no sense of unity at all. How can you let them dump everything on you? +Also, SAW ran off after muttering to herself, it's really worrying.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:If I may interrupt, I did my share of the work, so don't lump me in.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:If it's SAW, she's probably blowing her gum in the backyard. +—Alright, alright, make way please, I still need to mop inside the room.
()||<黑点1>:M60 hurriedly moves out of the way and lets LWMMG through. +She looks at the two big buckets of water in LWMMG's hands, then sighs and heads back to her own room.
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑点2><Night>:...In the evening. +In the Griffin base.
()||<Night>:As Mk48 circles around to the backyard, she sees FF M249SAW leaning against a column with her back to her. She's gazing at the sky in silence, save for the occasional, quiet popping sound. +Mk48 hesitates for a moment.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:...How long are you going to stand there, Mk48?
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Oh? You're actually starting a conversation with me? Is it not too tiring for you?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:...
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, LWMMG took care of your share of the cleaning, and the dorm was rated pretty well. +That's all I came to tell you. +Don't go back too late. If you're caught breaking curfew, LWMMG won't be able to cover for you again.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:Humph, she's the one who said <color=#87CEFA>"we may be colleagues, but we're not that close."</color> +So why is she acting like<color=#87CEFA>"I can help you with anything"</color>? +Honestly, we've been hanging out for so long, so why do we still feel like strangers?
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Then how about working your own share and not letting her help?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:...I'll pass. Too exhausting.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Okaaaaaaaaay. +I'll be heading back first, then.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Mk48 turns and heads back to the dorm, leaving FF M249SAW to her own device. She seems oddly delightedly, like she's getting ready for a good show.
