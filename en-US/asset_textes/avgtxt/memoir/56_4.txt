M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN>:RO? RO, are you there?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II? +...What are you doing here?
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Heheh, I came to see you, of course! +Still, this place is huge, so I can't find you...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So you just barged into the database without any idea of what you're doing?
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I was in a hurry to find you, RO... +My neural upgrade is complete! I want you to be the first to see!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Jeez... Alright. +Hold on a bit, I'll guide you to my current sector...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Huh? Why am I in the dorm?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Well, I was bored and I had no idea how long I'd be spending here, so I decided to remodel the surroundings. +Besides, there's lots of space here, so Persica probably won't mind.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:I can't believe you could do all this... You're amazing, RO!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Humph, I can do a lot more than this. +Didn't you say you were upgraded? You don't look very different than before, though? Also...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:Ah, well... +I like the way I looked before, so I asked Persica to make as few changes to my appearance as possible.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But you didn't need to keep that Dinergate either, did you?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well, seeing it reminds me of the time I spent with you and the others... +So I asked Persica to turn it into a piece of supporting accessory and kept it with me! +Plus, it's very cute, isn't it?
()||:SOP-II holds up her modified Dinergate in front of RO. +RO watches the Dinergate's stubby legs flail helplessly in the air, and sighs in resignation.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Eh, whatever. Besides, it's not like I hate it now... +You know, upgrades don't come by often. You could have asked Persica for so much more. +You're so headstrong but gullible at the same time...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:But I HAVE become stronger! Besides, no matter how I'm upgraded, I have to stay me. Otherwise it's just getting more powerful for its own sake, and there's no point in that!
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is that so...?
RO635(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...RO falls into a thoughtful silence.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO? 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It's nothing. Just mulling over your uncharacteristically wise words.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:What?! This remodel should have made me smarter too!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I can't tell. Maybe all it did was give you more ways to torture your enemies?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:Heheh, well, I do feel more inspired.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Eh, that's good... +I want to get out of this place and go outside too. I wonder what kind of body Persica's got waiting for me...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:I heard from Persica that a team is already hard at work on it! +She also said that you'd definitely be very happy with it when it's ready.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Happy? I sure hope so. I have no idea what Persica has in mind...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:By the way, RO... Are you alone here?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, why do you ask?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:If I remember correctly... there were two Sangvis Ringleaders with you when Persica put you in here, right?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh, you mean Ouroboros and Architect? +They were too much of a nuisance, so I took care of them.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Eh?! You destroyed them?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Why do you look so shocked? This is my home turf. +Also, I didn't destroy them. Persica must be keeping them around for a reason. +Right now... they're probably banging their heads against a wall in a dark corner somewhere.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Wow... For some reason I feel like RO has a scary side too...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>RO635(2)||:Don't worry. You've always been nice to me, so I won't lock you up in a dark room.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(2)||:Okay, that's a relief!! +Right, I gotta go, RO! I need to go see the Commander about a new assignment!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hold on! Remember to tell Persica to work faster! Make sure she doesn't forget about my new body!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Got it! I'll keep nagging her to work!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Also, don't forget Makarov and the others! Tell them I'll be back!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,2</黑屏1>:I~ got~ it~! I'll tell them too!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:...The farther away SOP-II goes, the softer RO's voice becomes.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:One more thing, SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh—?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Will you really be okay by yourself—?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm not alone—!
()||:SOP shouts back at the top of her voice and raises her Dinergate in her hands, giving it a shake for emphasis.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What — are — you — doing?! I — can't — see—!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'll — be — fine —! I — still — have — everyone — with — me —! Don't — worry —!
()||<黑屏1>:RO shouts something else, but SOP-II can't make it out. Still...it doesn't matter anymore.

M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now then... time to see the Commander! And meet all the new friends I've made!
()||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...SOP-II leaves the room and heads outside. The Griffin base is filled with busy T-Dolls running here and there.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:SOP-II! Is that you?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Cx4Storm(0)||:Cx4! We meet again, what a coincidence!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Yup! But... you look a little different from before, don't you?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Cx4Storm(0)||:That's right! My previous body was too old, so I had it replaced. How do you like it? Do I look good?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Yup! You look even cooler than before! +Actually... I wanted to thank you, SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Cx4Storm(0)||:Huh? You've already thanked me enough.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Not at all. I thanked you back for saving me. +But this time, I want to thank you because you gave me hope.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hope?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:I had no idea what I was capable of, and I spent my days mindlessly following orders at G&K... +But when you arrived, you showed me that there were a lot of things I could do! +Thank you for bringing me on an adventure, SOP-II. I can always do my best from now on even on my own!
MP40()<Speaker>MP40</Speaker>||:Cx4 Storm, hurry up! The logistics mission is about to start!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Ah, sorry, I'm rambling too much. Well, that's how it is. See you next time, SOP-II!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yup, we'll meet again! Do your best!
()||:...Cx4 Storm waves at SOP-II before rushing off. SOP-II watches her as she leaves for a good long time.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I should be the one thanking you... +If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't know I could do so much for everyone. +And the more I can do, the more courageous I become in the face of obstacles...
()||:SOP-II pats the Dinergate on her shoulder, and steps into the flow of traffic moving through the base.
