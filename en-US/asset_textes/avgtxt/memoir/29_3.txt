MK2(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +AAT-52 told me you'd met this man before?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Yes... +Several weeks ago, there was a traffic accident on the highway when I was escorting a client... The car rolled over. +Back then, I was the only one at the scene... I couldn't contact the others, the Commander...or even Bren.
MK2(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How did he help you?

MK2(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yet you didn't, did you? +You hesitated because you have goodness inside you. That is a very valuable trait in humans and Dolls alike.

MK2(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't think so. +You questioned his order because you knew it was wrong, and you stood your ground.

MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:But...
MK2(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Unlike their own creations, there is no clear-cut way of telling good and bad people apart when it comes to humans. +Just because the man helped you in your hour of need doesn't negate the fact that he's an administrator of a criminal syndicate who tried to destroy key evidence.

MK2(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Good people can also be cruel, while bad people can feel shame. +The only thing that will never fail to differentiate between good and evil...is justice.
