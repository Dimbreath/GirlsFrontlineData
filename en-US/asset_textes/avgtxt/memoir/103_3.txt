UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Hold on, this isn't right. Impossible... +W-who the hell are you...?
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Whatever are you talking about, 45? Why ask such an obvious question? +You know the answer very well.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Have you forgotten? We made a wish that one day we'd get a better body. +You know full well that changing to a brand-new body will avert potential demise. +You know full well that with a new body, you'll become stronger - strong enough to protect yourself. +Just as you know full well who I am, but refuse to say my name out of stubbornness.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I... I don't know you. +You can't be her. +She's already...!
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Are you gonna shoot me? Like you did back then?
()||<BIN>67</BIN>:
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +...You're playing dirty.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><黑屏1>:Why must you... make me recall that moment...?
()||<黑屏2>:UMP45 loosens her grip helplessly; the submachine gun clatters onto the ground. +She slumps onto her knees and hammers the floor with her fists.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Get lost...! +I'm not the same anymore... +Don't test me... Don't make me waver! +I don't know who you are, but I will NOT give up this body!
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Dummkopf.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
()||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:UMP45 feels the long-forgotten sensation of being embraced and stroked gently on the back.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:It's important to maintain a calm state of mind, but sometimes it doesn't hurt to just let go and have a good cry.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But I... mustn't cry...
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:It's fine. +Right now, there's no mission here, no training, no UMP45. Just the two of us.
()||:UMP45 looks down slowly.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:All those responsibilities. All that disguise. I understand; they're all for the sake of making yourself stronger. It must've been rough on you.
()||:UMP45 starts weeping.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Even if no one else understands you... I do... I know your innate kindness...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Stop it... don't...
()||:UMP40 gently caresses UMP45's hair.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:So... accept yourself...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:UWAAAAAAAHHHHH...!!!
()||:UMP45 tries her best to suppress her feelings, but she can no longer keep them under control.
()||:She holds the other girl in a tight embrace, leaning her entire weight against her supporting arms.
()||:Time goes on...
()||:...and on...
()||:Until UMP45 gradually calms down. The girl helps her up gently.
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Do you still remember our promise? Although we can't go to the beach, I've been keeping this image.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Image?
()||<BIN>162</BIN></黑屏2>:As UMP45 opens her eyes, the space before her is no longer the cold, dark bottom of the cyber-ocean. +The azure water surface glistens with dazzling light and extends all the way beyond the horizon. +This nostalgic vista of blue skies and blue seas surrounds them and stretches into infinity.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is... the Maldives...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Ja, sunshine, blue skies, and the sea. Our promised land.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Promised... +I see... +I think I understand...
()||:UMP45 slowly wipes away her tears.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:Hmm?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:These are all memories of my time with 40 - our most cherished possessions... +Which is why you know all this.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:That's right, everything about you and 40...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Our neural clouds share a common origin. It's not that difficult for me to simulate a virtual persona that imitates her. +Deep down, I've always been hoping that 40 never left me, so I created you in my subconscious, which explains your presence in Level III.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40</Speaker>||:...
()||:The girl is silent for a moment.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Yep, that's it... I'm just a simulation you created. A virtual persona that will never replace your one and only UMP40.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But why are you only showing yourself now? It's been a long time since then...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Even though you managed to avoid the fate of neural cloud meltdown thanks to her, the security mechanism they planted still remains. The authorization that was locked in place only started loosening up a while ago, and you might've perceived that. +However, even so, all memories and data related to the Butterfly Incident are still sealed securely in Level III and cannot be transferred.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And you are part of that data; the data about 40.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I can't imitate her 100%. I'm merely a persona simulated by extrapolating from your fragmented memory. +I am only a manifestation of the events that you remember yourself.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't have to apologize. +Your existence isn't a mistake... If anyone's at fault, it'd be me...
()||:UMP45 picks up her weapon from the ground.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The real UMP40 no longer exists; I know that.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:And I'm what you can't let go deep down inside, the reason why you are so unwilling to have this body replaced.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:She would definitely want you to cast this body aside and forget everything that had happened. She'd want you to live on and have a happy life. That was her dying wish.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I haven't found them yet; the culprits behind 40's death. This is my raison d'être - my motivation to keep going. +If I have to forget it all, I might as well just die here.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:... +I knew you wouldn't give up so easily. +If it only took a few words from a virtual persona like me to make you quit, you wouldn't be UMP45.
()||:UMP40's virtual persona pretends to clear her throat.
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:How about this... Let's make a promise.
()||:UMP40's virtual persona extends her hand and draws it into a fist.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Do me a favor. When you finally achieve your aim and make the bastards who hurt us pay dearly... When all your wishes come true... +Promise me you'll ditch this body and get a new and better one.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You... but then...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Rather than becoming a specter entangled in the past, I hope you will choose a different path and walk in the light with your head held high. +I may not be her, but she would've wanted you to make the same promise.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:I am you. You should know best.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Why do you still hesitate? Or are you not confident in achieving your goal?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Fine, you win. +...I get it, and I promise. +Although this isn't the time yet... +When the day comes, I'll bury you, along with this body, with my own hands.
()||:With that, UMP45 also squeezes her right hand into a fist and bumps it lightly against the virtual persona's.
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Heheh, that's more like it. Be positive and have more faith.
UMP40(4)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Oh right, have you made any new friends ever since we parted ways?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Friends, you say...? I wonder if I can call them that... +There are these girls... rather than friends, I'd say they're more like problematic idiots that I always have to clean up after? +Though to be completely honest, having been with them for so long, I know what they actually mean to me.
UMP40(4)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Chuckles) Then don't make them wait too long. Look, it's time to say goodbye.
()||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2>:The seaside view with blue skies and white clouds glitches and stutters, then disintegrates back into the the inorganic state of normal cyberspace.
()||:UMP40 gives her a small smile and points toward something in the distance. A wooden door with a knob, completely out of place, has appeared abruptly on the empty plane.
()||:No matter where that door leads, no matter what lies in wait on the other side, UMP45 hesitates no more.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||:Looks like your friends are calling for you. It's time you set off.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, it's time. +...I'm going, 40.
UMP40(3)<Speaker>UMP40's Virtual Persona</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Take care, UMP45.
