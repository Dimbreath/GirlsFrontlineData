格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:Where's the emergency repair kit? Did anyone bring it?! +This won't do. The circuitry is completely fried...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:How could this be...
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:Aren't you going to help, FF FNC?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>98</BIN>:...Why should I?
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:FF FN49 got this badly injured giving you cover.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>98</BIN>:I...I didn't ask her to come save me!
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:She was willing to come out and save your back even though she'd been taking so much of your crap. +Even if we don't consider that... +Shouldn't you at least help your saviour out of simple gratitude?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>98</BIN>:That's her own fault and n-none of my business!

FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点1>:FF FN49 still hasn't come back... +Why are her repairs taking so long...? +Maybe I should ask around.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:57! Are you there?!
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FNC? How unexpected. +How may I help?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm just wondering... Is 49 still not done with her repairs?
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>8</BIN>:Miss FF FN49, huh... +She was too severely damaged during the last mission and has been disassembled for reconstruction. Let's see... +It's almost time. A brand new FF FN49 should be reporting for duty pretty soon.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:What... +What do you mean?!
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That's right, your doting friend has completely forgotten about you. +You'd better start preparing a new self-introduction for later when you meet.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Liar! You're lying!! +Our neural clouds can be backed up!
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Her neural cloud was filled with unpleasant memories the day she joined us. +Do you think she would've backed them up properly?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I have some business to attend to. +You'll have to stay here or Miss FF FN49 will have to wait outside the door.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Five-seven saunters out of the room.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...How did this happen? +49... (sobs)
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Um... Excuse me...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Oh? +You're...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><BIN>8</BIN>:I'm FF FN49...reporting for duty today. +Nice to meet you! +May I ask who...?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm...I'm FF FNC... +(Sobs) I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... +FF FN49, I'm sorry...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:H-hold on... +Please don't cry...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I was always making fun of you...and making you take the blame for what I did... +I'm sorry...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Um, it's okay... +I don't remember anything from before.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I don't care if you remember or not... (sobs) +Is it too late for us to become friends again?
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Bien sur. It's never too late.
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FN49 gives the hair brush in her hand a little wave.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Huh? +That's...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:A welcome gift from you. +Sorry, I was just pulling your leg. +My neural cloud record is fully intact.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:So you actually remember... That's fantastic... +But that hair brush is just some cheap stuff that I meant to throw away the other day... You don't have to cherish it...
FNFNC(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:What a touching reunion. +Now can we all get along nicely?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Oui! +FF FN49...let's be good friends for real this time!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FNC offers her right hand.
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Before that...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:Smack! +FF FN49 grabs FF FNC's hand and whacks her palm hard with the hair brush.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ouch! W-what was that for?!
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hmm. This wasn't included in what we discussed beforehand.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FNC, I can certainly forgive you... +But my forgiveness has to be earned!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FN49...
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm sorry. I'm not actually a squishy goody-two-shoes, nor am I an insensitive block of wood. +I, too, get upset and mad when I'm bullied and misunderstood! +E-even I would feel wronged and lose my temper... +If you're just looking for another bullying victim, you'll have to look elsewhere!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm sorry... FF FN49... +I was wrong. I'll never bully you again... +Please, let's be friends and have fun together!
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hmm... If it's a FRIEND you're looking for... +You'll have to accept this side of me as well.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Nods) I will! +A...anything else?
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:No.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FN49(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:No?
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FN49 grins and gives FF FNC a hug.
FNFNC(0);FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:Nothing else... +From now on, let's be friends for real.
