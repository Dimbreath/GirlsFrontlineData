NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Good evening, my lovely ladies~ +Did you have a good rest? Did I make it before your shift ended—?
88typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type88</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:You seem to be in a good mood today, Miss Kalina.
88typeMod(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Of course! I finished all of today's combat reports on... huh, where are you going, Ai?
88typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type88</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I've got a night shift today! It's going to be field work, so I need to head off now. +However, I'll take good care of my work in the Café too.
88typeMod(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I see. It feels like you've become a lot busier since that upgrade, Ai...
88typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type88</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:It's fine. I like being busy like this! +I can remember everything now and I can do so much more. It's all thanks to you, Miss Kalina.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:It's time to go.
G36(0);NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Aw, you're making me blush. +Alright, all the best and have a safe journey.
88typeMod(0)<Speaker>Type88</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(5)||<BGM>BGM_PAUSE</BGM><黑点1>:In that case, I'll be going out with the head maid! +See you later, Miss Kalina!
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<黑点2>:Welcome, Miss Kalina. It's my shift now. +Would you like something to drink?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_UNPAUSE</BGM>:A special-brew latte, if you please.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:Alright, I'll prepare it for you right away.
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah...that said, it still makes me feel a little sad.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(1)||:What do you mean?
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm talking about her previous maintenance.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:I heard about it. Was it a cache problem?
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You could say that. She had too little space in her neural cloud before. +After installing the neural cloud module, not only did we manage to improve her capabilities, we even managed to let her use some of her previous skill apps in battle.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:That is very good news.
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I know, right?! That armor was super cool too. If the Commander had not brought it up, I wouldn't have thought of installing it to match her preferences.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(0)||:We were shocked the first time we saw that armor of hers.
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Well, it's not just for looks.
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Still, Springfield, aren't you going to...? +I mean, if you asked, there's no way the Commander would say no.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Well...it's not yet time. +If the day comes when I think, "I absolutely have to do this", I'll do it.
M1903Cafe(0);NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's true. You always put everyone at ease, Springfield. +The coffee was delicious, thank you for your service! +I need to head off now, see you later, Springfield.
