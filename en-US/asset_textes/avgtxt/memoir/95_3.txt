温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:That's the fifth time this week...and it's only Tuesday! The failure rate is too high!
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:It is necessary.+This battle has been dragging on for far too long. The brass wants us to finish the testing as soon as possible so we can push this generation of Assault Artillery into service.+You know that too, ■■■. Once we can successfully introduce it into live combat, they won't stand a chance against us.
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:I know, but even Dolls can't take this kind of intensive, high-impact testing! Can't we find some other way to do this, like having an AI directly control the Assault Artillery?
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:And how long do you think the programming for that will take?
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:At the very least, we ought to minimize unnecessary damage...
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:It's necessary as long as it ends the war more quickly.
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:Let me take Ai's place.
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:I understand how much you cherish 59898. She's very well-engineered, and she does look very cute.+But in the end, you will be the pilot of that mech, and she is only there to pave the way for you.
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:(Sobbing)
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:(Sighs) ■■■, don't place too much importance on her.+We are humans, and they are nothing more than reusable tools. You are much more valuable than they are. Don't cheapen yourself.+Now, I need to be off.
