LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...And that's how it is, so please grant your approval.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course. +Mm, <color=#FFD700>"wanting to become stronger so you can better protect your friends"</color> is an excellent notion. You've grown, Lam!
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑点1>:No, Commander, I'm still a long way off. +Also...why is EVERYONE calling me that now...
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑点2><Night>:The next evening. +In the dorm backyard.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:<color=#A9A9A9>(I've spotted her, it's SAW.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(She's still the same as always, sitting on the steps and blowing her gum while looking at the clouds...)</color>
()||<Night>:LWMMG stands quietly a short distance behind SAW, just studying her back.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<Night>:<color=#A9A9A9>How long are you going to stand there, Mk48...?</color>
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Um... +SAW, I'm sorry.
()||<震屏><Night>:Pop.
()||<Night>:The bubble bursts softly just as LWMMG finishes speaking. +FF M249SAW flinches slightly, but she doesn't turn around. +LWMMG walks up to M249SAW's side and sits down. At the same time, FF M249SAW turns to look away from her.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Um... +Earlier...I spoke very harshly to you, and I'm really sorry.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:(Silence...)
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:I used to think that I could handle all the things you didn't finish, didn't want to do, or couldn't do. +No matter how much work it was, all I had to do was help. I could handle everything on my own. +Back then, when I pushed you aside and took the shell myself, I also thought it was all the same thing.

()||:FF M249SAW's hands quietly ball up into fists beside her.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:—But. +But now I realize that it's not the same... +I didn't cherish myself, and I let you down. I was wrong.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<Night>:So, (turns around) are you still going to carry on about how it's okay if you d—
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<震屏>2</震屏><Night>:Lam?! Who-who-who-who the hell are you?!
()||:It is then that FF M249SAW sees the remodelled LWMMG for the first time.
LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Huh? Um...it's me... Lam. +Um...I went for a remodel, you know, the application that I submitted to the Commander last month. +I didn't expect the Commander to accept it so readily...but well, here I am.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:Ehhhh? But-but why? +You were perfectly fine before, so why'd you go for a remodel all of a sudden...? +Oh! Did that simulation accident cause some kind of complication that couldn't be repaired? Is that why you had to get remodelled?
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:(Chuckles) No... +Ahem, I was just thinking, this way...I might be able to do a better job protecting you all.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:...Eh?
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:I'm not going to say outrageous things like <color=#FFB6C1>"it doesn't matter if I die"</color>  anymore. +I didn't consider how everyone felt and I hurt you. +And I...don't want to see you hurt.
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)||:
()||:FF M249SAW lowers her head. LWMMG can't see her expression under her hood.
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:So, will you forgive me, SAW?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:(Blushes) L-Lam... +Actually, I was wrong too! Everything would have been fine if I'd just explained it clearly to you back then!
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Huh?
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:I noticed that you were always alone, even when you were teamed up with us. +You insisted on doing everything by yourself, you were willing to help us with everything, but you wouldn't let us help you in return... It really rubbed me the wrong way! +And back then, I was angry because you said that kind of nonsense, and it was like...like you didn't think of us as friends at all...
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Friends, huh...
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:So what I want to say is...Lam, friends are friends because they help each other!
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)||:
()||:LWMMG freezes for a moment, then she chuckles.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:<color=#A9A9A9>(So her remodel has given her the ability to laugh...)</color>
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:I don't know what you're thinking, but I don't want another Lam! I don't want a new Lam from a copied neural cloud! +I only want you, this Lam! +So I forbid you to die!
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:... +Thank you, SAW. +I'll need you all to help me out from now on so that I don't die.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMGMod(0)||<Night>:But of course!
M249SAW(0);LWMMGMod(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:—Also, I've decided that from now on, I'll be helping you less. I can't keep spoiling you. +You'll need to stop being <color=#FFB6C1>"a bubblegum slime monster"</color> and stand up on your own two feet to do your own work. ♪

Commander()||<Night>:(Whispers) How about that, Mk48? I told you they'd make up.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker><Shake>||<Night>:How could this happen...? +Ahhhhhh I'm so mad! How come I lost my wager with you again—?!
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><Night>:(Hurriedly shushes her) Quiet, you! +In any case, it all turned out well for LWMMG and SAW.
