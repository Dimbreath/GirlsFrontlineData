KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:Are we there yet?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Yes, this is it.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Such a desolate place... +How long has it been abandoned?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:About three years, I think. +This place used to be very quiet, so people built a sanatorium here. +Once there were trees full of birds...Meadowlands vibrant with flowers...
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:...Carefree the songs our children once sang.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:You still remember this song.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Someone was singing it in my dreams.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Do you remember the rest?
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker>||:Clouds came and covered the sun... +The breath of a baleful unease...turning to ashes flowers in their fields...
()<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:...Silenced the birds in their trees.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:This song is from an old CD recorded many, many years ago. +It's allegedly a song from the soundtrack of some kind of game... A beautiful and tragic story that's very commonplace in real life these days.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Was this sanatorium...also destroyed in some catastrophe?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Collapse radiation. The contamination spread as the black clouds of death approached. +In the end, they had to leave this place behind.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I see. +Did I spend time here as well?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Yes, you worked here for several years. +Come, go up this way.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Can't we just jump up directly from here?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:The foundation of this building is severely corroded. It might all come crashing down with a stomp.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Right. This way to the second floor?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Yes, you go first. Fourth room on your left.

KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1><黑屏2>:What exactly awaits me...?
KSVK(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||:Hahaha, Ash! Look, the sunflowers have bloomed!
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Is this...my memory?
KSVK(0)<Speaker>Old Female Voice</Speaker>||:You're right... Such a radiant color. My favorite flower...
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ms...Ash.
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:The ceiling is half-collapsed. There can't be anything valuable in here, right?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:Just have a look.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Fine.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:A few minutes later.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Oh, this is still here.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:What? Wooden spikes?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:An easel. I'm going to lift this up; check if you can find anything underneath.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:There is something; let me get it out. +...Did I...paint this?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(0)||:You recognize it even with dirt all over it?
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:It's just...a hunch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:KSVK flicks the dirt off the oil canvas.
KSVK()<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Winter Rider is Winner... +...ДушевнАЯ (Dushevnaya).
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||<BIN>84</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The new patient is quite a handful.
()<Speaker>Gentle and Concerned Female Voice</Speaker>||:When I was a kid, she was my favorite artist. +I never thought I'd see this name in the hospital where I work. Could this possibly be fate...?
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||:Wanna ask her for an autograph? It could still be worth a great deal, don't you think?
()<Speaker>Gentle and Concerned Female Voice</Speaker>||:I'd love to, but you've seen her when she was admitted. If I go up to her, she'd probably slap me right in the face. +What on earth has she gone through...?
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||:Ash James, a British woman who married into a Russian family. Strongly attached to her home and extremely stubborn, she once refused to relocate to a safe zone, bringing a local construction to a standstill for several months. +During a trip to visit her, her son and his entire family were severely injured by a buried WWIII landmine. They are still hospitalized in the ICU to this day. The patient blames it all on herself, subsequently developing frequent self-harm tendencies and reacts violently to any attempt to approach her.
()<Speaker>Gentle and Concerned Female Voice</Speaker>||:...Then the government sent her to this sanatorium.
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||:We're sandwiched between the safe zone and the contamination zone. If the government doesn't work out something soon, this place will also become a wasteland in a few years. +This patient is from a well-to-do family. The government is basically giving us a chance to make some good money before this place is swimming in radiation and we're forced to make a living elsewhere...
()<Speaker>Gentle and Concerned Female Voice</Speaker>||:Don't say that, Mr. Director. I'm sure the folks at the Academy of Sciences will come up with a solution, and this is just an ordinary patient.
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||:...Perhaps I was being paranoid. Back to the subject – the patient is highly aggressive and hardly an ordinary patient. +Assign a Nursing Doll to her. 
()<Speaker>Gentle and Concerned Female Voice</Speaker>||:Yaya is already caring for an elderly patient so she probably can't handle another case... And Helena is a Security Doll. If we put her in charge of an old woman, they'll probably end up at each other's throats.
()<Speaker>Low Male Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:One of the new Dolls should still be idle, right? Let her try.

NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:It was my fault. It's all my... +The green grass and red blossoms...the birds of the past...the garden and my family...
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Knock knock knock. Someone is rapping on the door.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1><震屏>:Scram! Leave me alone!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||:Ms. James, I am your new nurse.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||:I don't need a bloody nurse!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||:Ms. James... +I know that you are in very great pain, but your loved ones would be heartbroken to know that you're torturing yourself.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||:Heartbroken? Ha... Such audacity from a whelp like you. +Who'd be heartbroken? +My loved ones all died because of me!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||:Ms. James...
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||:I can hear them... My son, my daughter-in-law, their child. +They whisper in my ears, moaning in agony... Being pierced by shrapnel is a lot more painful than what this little knife can do to me!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||:Please stop hurting yourself!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||:What can you do about it?! +Even if I die here, what of it? You won't lose a single penny because of that, will you?! +Or does your salary depend my life?!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Clear Voice of a Girl</Speaker>||<震屏>:That isn't the case... But this is hardly the time to explain. +Helena, help!
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1>:Whoa...!
DP12(1)<Speaker>Helena</Speaker>||:Oops, I might've overdone it. Head in there.
KSVK(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Sorry for barging in like this... But you mustn't hurt yourself anymore.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>;KSVK(6)||:Don't bother bandaging me. I'd hardly die from this.
NPC-Oldartist(1);KSVK(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:No, your wounds must be treated. This is so sad...
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>;KSVK(6)||:Sad? Who'd be sad? +Who'd feel sad for a stubborn sack of old bones like me?
NPC-Oldartist(1);KSVK(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I would, Ms. James.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>;KSVK(6)||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...
NPC-Oldartist(1);KSVK(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:This makes me really sad... My duty is to keep you company.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>;KSVK(6)||:...Sigh. +My granddaughter would probably have grown into someone like you, had she been given the chance.
NPC-Oldartist(1);KSVK(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:If you don't mind, I can be your family. +There, your wounds are dressed. Please keep the area away from water until it heals. I will help bathe you for the time being.
NPC-Oldartist(1)<Speaker>Ash</Speaker>;KSVK(6)||:Family...sigh. +If only these useless hands of mine could still protect something... Tell me, sweet child, what is your name?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Please call me Dushevnaya.
