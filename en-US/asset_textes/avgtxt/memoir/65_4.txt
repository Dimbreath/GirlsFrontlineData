()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2>:(Groans)
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh? You're finally awake.
()||<睁眼><BIN>70</BIN>:
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I feel dizzy... Dier, what did your machine do to me? Is it really going to be alright?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I didn't expect your neural cloud scan to take almost twice as long as Gr G11's. I couldn't be bothered to wait in the meantime so I took a nap.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'm not a simple-minded sleepyhead like Gr G11. I've got too many things to remember.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Really? Still, after the scan, I found that you had enough space in your neural cloud for me to stuff a whole pile of things in there.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you making fun of me?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:No, no, I'd never do that. +I'm saying you've got a lot of space left in there. It's not like UMP45's case, where she had trouble just doing normal processing. I found out after the scan that I.O.P. left a lot of space open for Griffin to upgrade you. +An enhanced grenade launcher module, a multi-thread processor upgrade for electronic warfare, the latest model of dual-purpose neural cloud attack barrier...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I figured that I should just jam everything I had on hand into you since you were sleeping, but I still couldn't max you out.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Dier. When were my clothes changed?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Huh? It was just before you woke up. Why do you ask?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:416 raises her gun and takes aim at Dier.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Ahhhhhhh no-no-no you've gotten it all wrong! I didn't do anything rude to you! +Besides, it wasn't my idea to change your clothes! Sier came up with it!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sier...? She did? Why?
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Sier passed by just now and saw you during your neural cloud scan. She looked in on you and said, "A lady ought to be dressed in something that befits her status..." +So she went and designed a new outfit for you, made it with a 3D sewing machine, and changed you into it.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:...At first, I didn't understand why a pair like you and Sier, who couldn't be more different from each other, could team up to set up a workshop. +But now it seems that the two of you really are brother and sister, in all kinds of strange and interesting ways.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I'm glad you understand... Honestly, I gave you a whole bunch of upgrades out of the kindness of my heart and I don't even get a word of thanks in return.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:It's not like you need verbal thanks anyway. What you're after is real, actual payment.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:(Sighs) If it's just money, I've got a lot of Doll-fixing jobs lined up for me. +In the first place, I could have charged a hefty sum just for conducting an ordinary neural cloud scan. Facilities like this don't exactly grow on trees.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Then what about Gr G11? You said her neural cloud diagnostics finished before mine...
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Hm? Oh yeah, the diagnostic revealed that she hasn't gotten worse or anything. Everything's normal, but there's quite a few bad sectors and permanent damage in her neural cloud.+Since I didn't have the luxury of giving her more upgrades, I sent her off to the game room after making a few small repairs.
()||:Dier gestures to the side, at a security camera monitor display which shows Gr G11 holding a controller and playing a video game against a maid Doll.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Ah, ah, ah! I win! Fräulein Maid, I'm surprised by how good you are at Kamen Fighter!
G11(0)<通讯框>;G11story(1)<Speaker>Maid Doll</Speaker><通讯框>||:Master Dier is busy most of the time, so I usually only get to play games by myself...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>;G11story(1)<通讯框>||:What else do you know? Have you ever played the remake of Dark Zombies 2? How about trying it in co-op mode?
G11(0)<通讯框>;G11story(1)<Speaker>Maid Doll</Speaker><通讯框>||:...I would be happy to. Shall we set the difficulty to Hell Mode?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Sounds great! Looks like we're going to be good friends!
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Well? Want me to call her over? Or should I take you to her?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...No need for that. Things are fine as they are now. +This is just fine.
()||:416 gazes at Gr G11's image on the screen and watches as the latter laughs heartily while having fun. +Slowly, 416's deeply furrowed brows start to relax, and the corners of her mouth turn up slightly.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Seeing you like this...reminds me of the first time we met. You really do dote on Gr G11.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You like her very much too, don't you? Even your maids are the same model as her.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Ahem. It's just a memento of the first Doll I modified. +So, as per our arrangement, all this...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:It won't leave this room. Don't worry.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:That's good. +Speaking of which, I was actually quite surprised when you came to find me. I didn't think a Doll would do this much for another Doll who was a complete stranger.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:That's all in the past. And besides, she's a Tactical Doll now. She can wipe her own ass. +Plus, if it wasn't for UMP45's schemes, I wouldn't need to do so much work to pay her back for Gr G11's sake.
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:...Huh. Didn't she tell you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Tell me what?
HK416Mod(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I thought you already knew... The day you brought Gr G11 to my workshop, UMP45 already paid me for two fire control cores...and Gr G11's repair bill. +Of course, that wasn't the full amount, though according to what I knew, that ought to have been all her savings, so I let her pay off the rest later. + (Sighs) If I'd known I shouldn't have set a precedent of extending her credit. Now I'm having a hard time saying no when she asks for it.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So you're saying...she was going to help Gr G11 from the start...?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Who knows? At the very least, that's the impression I got from her. +I'll be honest; you might find it hard to believe that 45 would help you for nothing, but she told me that she'd had her eye on you from a long time ago. Could it be that the two of you were in the same unit before coming to this city?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If it were up to me, it would be enough of a reason for me to kill her and not help her. +But...forget it. My old self would have thought 45 had twisted your arm to make you say this. +Right now, though, I think I understand her way of doing things, more or less.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Really? If there's nothing pressing, make sure you do more neural cloud scans. It's effective at helping you sort out your emotions and memories and does a great deal of good for a Doll's mental health. +If 45 were willing to take some time out to do a neural cloud scan too, then maybe we could do something about that snarky attitude of hers...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh? So is that how you've thought of me all this while, Dier?
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><Shake>||:Ah...!
()||:Dier shuffles a few feet away to maintain a safe distance from UMP45, who has suddenly appeared next to him.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:416, how do you feel after taking a nap?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Not much different from before, and I still have to look at an annoying face when I open my eyes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Very good. Then we need to sort our gear out before hurrying to catch our train.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Catching a train, huh... I used to think that you and I were only going to share the same train for a while.
()||:UMP45 pauses at that. Then she shrugs.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Do you want to get off early? +I'm fine with that. But you'd better tell everyone else first. After all, I don't want to be your errand girl.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Nein, it seems I've missed my stop. Looks like I'll have to take this train all the way to the end of the line with you and wait for it to loop back.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That sounds incredibly stupid, but it also sounds like something you would do. +Let's go. We need to wake 9 up and drag Gr G11 out of the game room.
()||<黑屏1>:UMP45 pats 416 on the shoulder with her right hand. 416 replies with a "humph" before following 45 out of the room.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:Even now, I still want to return to Griffin. +But I already made my choice when I chose not to take the evac chopper back then. +I will stay here, and continue traveling with Squad 404 as one of them, until we all find the destinations where we belong—
