64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM><BIN>73</BIN>:Whew... Done at last. +Let's look at today's data.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Eh? I'm still no better than before.+I've been training for almost two weeks, so why isn't it showing any results...?
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Oh, it's you, 64. What are you doing here?+ I rarely see you around this place.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Ah, it's Miss Type 56R... +I'm training myself here. I feel that my stamina's bad, so I want to condition myself...
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Is this about the lapcheung incident from earlier?+(Sighs) Our younger comrades nowadays just don't understand how to treat their sisters-in-arms well. +I can't believe Hawk got all serious over a simple meal. Don't you think she might've schemed against you during the obstacle course?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:It's not like that, Miss Type 56R... +I dropped out halfway because I didn't have enough stamina.
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Well, no matter. Let them enjoy the taste of triumph this time round. +No need to feel down. We'll do things right next time and win the kitchen back!
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:That's why I need to train myself up. +However, I haven't made any improvement in nearly two weeks of training, so I don't know what to do.
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:If hard work isn't working out, then it's probably a problem with your methods.+Want to ask Miss Kalina about it? She ought to be able to figure out where the problem lies.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<黑屏1><BIN>73</BIN>:Mm-hm, I'll do that.+Thank you for the suggestion, Miss Type 56R.+(I'm sure Type 56R didn't want to lose to 56-1 either...)+(So I've got even more reason not to disappoint her.)
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:I see... So you wanted to improve your athletic ability, Miss 64.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||<BIN>89</BIN>:Yes, is there a way to do this?
64type(0);NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:This...might come as a bit of a disappointment, but... +Miss 64, your body's basic mobility falls short compared to the other Dolls.+So even if I helped remodel you, spec-wise you'd only reach the level of an ordinary Doll at best.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(3)||<BIN>89</BIN>:...I see.
64type(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Well...don't be sad, Miss 64.+Being able to reach the average level is already pretty good.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||<BIN>89</BIN>:Um...+Then can I trouble you to prepare a remodel kit for me? +I want to become stronger...even if it's only a small improvement.
64type(0);NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点1><BIN>89</BIN>:Yup! I'll keep that in mind when making my orders! +Tell you what, I'll contact you when the stock arrives!
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2>:And so, that's how it went.+Miss Kalina said a remodel wouldn't solve everything...
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Don't feel bad, 64. At least we know which path not to take now. That's a good thing, right? +There are many ways to win a battle, and we may not necessarily have to compete with others in physical ability.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:...So stamina isn't everything?
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:You need to fight smart.+Think about it. Leaving stamina aside, how are you better than Hawk and the others?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:...+It doesn't seem like I'm better than them in any way.
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Then...how about areas where you're different from them? That could work too.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:If I had to give an answer... +Then I'd have to say that sometimes, they have a hard time spotting me because I'm very quiet.
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:That's it!+Being inconspicuous is also an advantage. That way you can circle behind the enemy more easily and sneak up on them during an attack, right?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;56typeR(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:I've got it! +I think I've got an idea about what kind of training I'm going to do... Thank you, Miss Type 56R. +I need to go talk to Miss Kalina and revise the list of add-on parts I gave her just now.
64type(0);56typeR(0)<Speaker>Type56R</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Mhm! I'm always happy to see my friends grow stronger! +Do your best, Comrade 64!
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏1>:I will! +I need to pull myself together so I don't waste the help that everyone gave me...
