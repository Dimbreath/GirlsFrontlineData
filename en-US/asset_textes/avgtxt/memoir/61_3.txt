StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Oh, it rained yesterday. This place...is very muddy! +Should we go around, Angel?
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:Angel?
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:... +... +<Size=60>NO GOING AROUND!</Size>
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That...almost knocked out my hearing module...! +I thought you'd stopped possessing the Shield Fairy...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:I was just doing some thinking! +Anyway, this is your training ground!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:This...? But there's nothing here but mud...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:That's precisely the point. +You must get over your clean freak tendencies.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hold on, you don't expect me to...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Your Commander is too soft. +They have never sent you into battles where you have to get real dirty, have they? +But if you ever run into such conditions, wouldn't you be completely useless?
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:For the sake of my mission...of course I'd... +... +If the Commander gives the order, I would do my best...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:See? You just can't let go of your lady's dignity. +Is this the extent of your determination?
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:B-but... +This is hardly necessary, is it? Do I really have to do this?
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:Are you questioning your angel? +This is exactly why nobody wants to give you anything to do!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:...You're right... +But that's how I've been programmed, I can't help if... +My neural cloud is warning me against walking into the mud!
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:There are no chips in your shoes. You'll be fine.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:I don't tend to worry about the cleanliness of my clothes on the battlefield... +But this is a bit too much...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:You said it yourself - you'd do exactly as I say. +So why are you second-guessing me now? +Now step into the mud.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:...
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:No neural upgrade, terrible personality. +You want the Commander to appreciate you without making an effort to improve yourself? There is no such thing as a free lunch, you know? +Even this drone that I'm...possessing is more intricate and multi-functional than you.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Neural upgrade? That's right, that's also a solution! If I can receive a neural upgrade, surely the Commander will dispatch me to the frontlines again?)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(...But I would be the last Doll to be given such a precious opportunity.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(No, I'm already a burden. If I am to be of help to the Commander on the battlefield, if I want to fight next to the Commander...)</color> +I understand. I have to change. +Please supervise my progress, Angel!
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:That's the spirit~ +Then let's conquer the clean freak in you!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Roger that! StG44, commencing operation! +...Eeeep!
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:Nope! Wrong shooting posture! +That won't do!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><Shake>;FairyShield(0)||:I'm so sorry, I'll try again... This mud...is getting in the way!
StG44(0);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker>||:That's better! Forget about the mud! I'm watching you like a hawk! Don't slack!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;FairyShield(0)||<黑屏1>:Right, let's start over...!
()||<BIN>18</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Meanwhile.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:She should be just about here... +Oh, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:I heard something strange over here.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Strange? +Oh, gunshots! Is it an enemy attack? That can't be, we're inside the base! +Also...that sounds like a drone.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let me take a look.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:...Be careful, Commander.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't think we have to worry too much... More importantly, Kalina. +Do you remember the report about a missing drone?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker><Shake>||:Oh, you mean...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's see for ourselves. I have no answers yet.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:By the way, Commander, there's another matter about StG44...
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:How was that shot?
StG44(1);FairyShield(0)<Speaker>Angel</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Perfect! The way you look kneeling in all this sludge is hila...urk!
StG44(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The voice gets cut off. +StG44 turns around, but the angel is nowhere to be found. +Instead, she finds the Commander and Kalina standing there, gaping at her.
StG44(1)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...Oh, Commander.
StG44(1);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:My god... StG44, what on earth happened to you?
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:StG44... <c>Are you alright? <c>What are you doing here?
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I'm very well, Commander!
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:You don't look well at all.
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I...I'm fine, Commander, really! Please believe me!
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:An angel is guiding me...
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Angel?
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Uh...nothing. +I'm just doing some...field battle training here.
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(She's a lousy liar. Still, if she doesn't want to talk about it, I'll just drop it.)</color> +Alright, let's get to the point then. +StG44, I've been looking for you.
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:For me...? +Has there been a new arrangement? I will obey your orders. +<color=#A9A9A9>(Even if the outcome is the one I dread so much.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(O Angel, please watch over me.)</color>
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've recently discovered a bug in the AI program that's in charge of organizing the roster. It seems to have overlooked you...
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What?!
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:StG44? What's the matter?
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:S-sorry... +I was just a bit agitated... Thank you...
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +StG44, your performance has always been exceptional. Not a single mistake.
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Right...
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So don't think yourself into a corner.
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:I understand, Commander... +Um...pardon my bad manners, but could you please avert your eyes for the time being? +In my present state...I find it very humiliating...
StG44(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I get it. +Then we'll be going then. If anything happens, remember to report it.
StG44(1)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:Of course... +<color=#A9A9A9>(Looks like I misunderstood the whole thing. What a relief.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(But am I really content with the status quo?)</color>
