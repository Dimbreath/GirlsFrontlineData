M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>;M1911(0)||:M14 and I are ready. We can punch our enemies full of holes anytime!
M21(0);M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Good. Please keep an eye on M14. Tell her about the way you fight if you've got free time.
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>;M1911(0)||:No problem. Leave it to me!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Hmm. I know I can count on you. +I'll see you later.
()||:M1911 terminates the call.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:What are we gonna do, M21?
M14(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Just wait for the enemy forces to set foot in the trap. +Then "bang, bang, bang" them all!
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>;M21(0)||:We understand!
M14(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Right, this is the first time you're fighting this way...so you can just be on standby next to me. +If there are too many of them, help me with whatever I miss.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>;M21(0)||:Okay, we'll definitely do our job!
M14(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:By the way, I've been wondering about this for a while...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>;M21(0)||:What?
M14(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Why do you address yourself as "we"?
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>;M21(0)||:Well...we do it so that M14 never forgets about our old companions!
M14(0);M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Old companions?
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Yeah. It was a long time ago...
()||:At that moment, Thompson's voice comes through the comm link with gunshots in the background.

()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Several minutes later. +... +Combat over.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Thompson! Thompson!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Looks like you're still in one piece, M14.
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Of course she is. I'm with her.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Look, Thompson, we didn't lose a single screw this time!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Isn't that how it's supposed to be, M14? +You were never meant to be a walking target on the field.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Hmm, we understand... That's why we did as M1911 said and fired from the back. +Were you satisfied with our performance?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑点1>:It's...acceptable. Nothing exceptional. +Now let's not waste time and head for the next location.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>85</BIN><黑点2>:...In a safe house somewhere.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:We're now in Phase 2. +M14, you stay behind to guard this outpost. Everyone else, with me.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Wait... You're not taking us with you?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:The operation will be rather risky from now on. You just switched positions so it's unwise to have you with us. +We'll rendezvous after the battle.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:But...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:No buts. Squad leader's order.
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Don't worry, M14! +We'll sort it out quickly and come back for you soon!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Keep in touch. +I'll call you over if we need help.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Okay...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The rest of the squad leave the safe house. +M14 sits down against the wall of the building on her own.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:... +It's all the same... +We still got left behind.
()||:M14 curls into a ball and hugs her knees while she waits.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm all alone. +... +I hate how it feels... +It's just like back then...
M14(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><回忆><黑屏1>0,5<黑屏1><BIN>73</BIN>:Don't give up. We will definitely pass the test!
M14(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,5<黑屏2><回忆><黑屏1>0,5<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:Our numbers are dwindling... +Are we really a defective model?

()||<黑屏1>:There once was a line of T-Doll that was put under hundreds and thousands of test during its development. +Countless units of the same model were screened out from during the testing process. +In the end, only a single unit passed all performance tests...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>85</BIN><黑屏1>:The remaining unit...was me.
