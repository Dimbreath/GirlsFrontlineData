L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker><Shake>1</Shake>||:H-Holy! +You scared the living hell out of me... IDW, could you please not shout into my ears next time you greet me?
L85A1(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Sorry! I'm just so excited! <size=50>Bren will be joining our squad again today, right?!!</size> +<size=60>It's been aaages since we last saw her! I miss her so much!!!</size>
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Ahaha... I do understand how you feel...
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:But stop shouting! If Bren hears you...
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Shut up, stupid cat.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Huh? It...it's you, Bren?! +You look so different! +Wow, your new clothes look awesome!!!
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<震屏3>:I told you to pipe down!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Welcome back, Bren! +Looks like your neural upgrade has gone well.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Yes, I definitely feel stronger. +All thanks to Welrod for getting me a place.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:(Sniffles) I'm so glad you're back!
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:W-wait, why are you suddenly crying?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I'm just a little emotional today...
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Didn't you invite me to the tea party? +Instead of crying, go and brew me some tea already.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Dear me... You're strict as always, Bren.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:That's because you slack too much. +...Right, where's Welrod?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:She's gone to get permission for hosting the tea party!
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Didn't you already have permission from the Commander?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:But you left, nya. +So the team leader asked us to put the tea party on hold until you come back!
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:...She's always doing unnecessary things.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Now that you're back, let's discuss the details of the tea party, shall we?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:Oh...sure. +What do we need to discuss?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Let me see... +All that's left to decide is the décor of the café.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:I say we go for a SUUUUUPER CUTE style with lots of cat plushies, nya!
IDW(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:That's way over the top. I suggest a classic English style... +What do you think, Bren?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:To remind us all to never forget our mission, let's go for a shooting range theme.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position>;IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Huh?! +No, no, no! That'll scare everyone away, nyan!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Bren, somehow you seem to have become more and more like Welrod ever since you came back... +Did she infect you with some kind of virus?!
L85A1(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? I'm not even equipped with an electronic warfare module.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker><Shake>1</Shake>;Welrod(0)||:A-ack! +Welrod...could you make your presence known next time you walk in? +Scared me half to death...
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:You're not alert enough. +If you can't even sense the vibrations on the floorboards, you make a very easy target for enemies to ambush.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:...Pffft.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Uh, Bren...is giggling?! +Captain! L85A1!! Look, Bren is laughing!!!
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Stupid cat, stop making such a fuss. +I just find it...quite funny when you are bickering with each other.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Are you making fun of us, Bren? +We are in a very serious discussion, you know?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:That's right! You should also take this more seriously, Bren!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Sigh...here we go again. +When will we be able to reach a decision...?
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Alright, cut it out. +In any case, we must come up with a plan by the end of today. We can't disappoint the Commander and the others.
BrenMKMod(0)<Position>0,230</Position><Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Also, there's something else I want to tell you.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:... +I still want to grow stronger. +I'm still searching for a reason to be strong, as Welrod has suggested. +But for now, I think I've found one that's good enough—
布伦()<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sorry for making you worry about me. +Bren, officially back on duty as of today. +Please do not hesitate to send me on the most challenging missions. +I shall prove my strength through action!
