M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<BGM>GF_Cafe</BGM>:... +So, have you decided yet?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Yeah. +My bloodline is both my pride and my burden +If I lose it, then there's no reason for me to remain on the frontlines.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:But I'm sure the Commander will be in a tight spot if you reject the neural upgrade.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I don't mind if I have to leave the combat echelons. If it's just staying in Griffin, there's actually a lot of things I can do. +See, there are a lot of requests for concierges and ceremonial guards...! +Hahaha, looks like a second springtime for my career!
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:I still remember how you and Miss OTs-14 used to complain about being put on emergency concierge duty...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Yeah, that was a tiring and annoying assignment. +Still, I have no choice. At least it suits me.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Are you...really not going to give it a little more thought?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I've done enough of that. There's no point thinking any further. +Springfield... +Let's have a hug.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:...Okay.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<黑屏1>:Please...take care.

()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>0.7</黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... +Inside the Griffin dorms.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:I found a bunch of stray cats behind the data room several nights ago. +The kittens were already running all over the place, but I wasn't sure what to do with them.
SKS(0);SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:If they're stray cats, why not send them to the rescue station? +If you leave them be, they might cause another awkward incident. +Ah... +...Do you still remember what Mosin-Nagant said one morning about the incident during the Commander's briefing?
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>;SVT38(0)||:I do, I do... +But... +I haven't met Mosin-Nagant in a while. She gets up early every day and comes back late every night.
SKS(0);SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Yeah, and sometimes she gets a day off, but everyone's out on missions. +The ceremonial guard usually covers her meals, but I'll get jealous if she eats better than us.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>;SVT38(0)||:Hehe, now who was the one who said "I'll never settle for just being a pretty decoration!" +...Still, she really has been very quiet recently. She's not as lively as she used to be when she was here. +Normally, she'd be making a racket with all those vodka fiends!
SKS(0);SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:You are one of those vodka fiends too. At least Mosin-Nagant still has her sober moments... +But it's true... I do kind of miss the old days... +And the passionate and cheerful person that she was...
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;SVT38(0)||:... +But she never left us...
TT33(0);SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Hm? Tokarev? What did you say?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;SVT38(0)||<黑屏1>:It's nothing... I have to go.

()||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Griffin HQ, inside the ceremonial guard break room.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Whew...it's finally over... +Let's see... how much time do I have left until my next shift... +Looks like I can get some sleep... Heh! Lucky me!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Mosin-Nagant!
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Huh?! Is that you, Tokarev! What are you doing here?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Kalina had to come to HQ today for something... +I remembered you're stationed here and hitched a ride.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Wow! You came all this way for me? +But you didn't have to go to all that trouble! I come back to the dorms at night too! +Have you been to HQ before? It's huge, why don't I show you around the place?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Mosin-Nagant...there's something I'd like to know. +And there's something I'd like to ask you.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Hm? What is it? +Still, if something's the matter...you can just look me up in the dorm, right?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:But you look so tired when you come back from HQ every night, and I don't want to bother you when you're like that...
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:... +Hm, alright. What is it?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:... +Miss Mosin-Nagant... +Why did you...why did you accept this arrangement, just like that?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:In the past, whether you were in the base or fighting S.F... +You were always full of confidence, and you never gave up easily. +Why did you leave just like that...and why did you come here, of all places?!
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:... +There wasn't any special reason for it, it was just a personal decision. +Besides, my transfer would open up a new vacancy. That way, other juniors with potential might end up being promoted. That's a good thing for everyone.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...A good thing...?!
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:(Sighs) +My schedule's really tight, and I need some time to prepare. +If there's nothing else, I'll be going back now.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Mosin-Nagant, did you end up this way because of the neural upgrade list?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...Tokarev, not everything is a conspiracy like you imagine.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I want to know why you're so against being remodeled, Miss Mosin-Nagant! +Are you saying that you're willing to leave us all for the sake of protecting your bloodline?!
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:... +What if the results of the upgrade made me into something else entirely? How would that be different than building a brand-new T-Doll?  +You'll be welcoming someone you've never seen before either, so what difference would my choice make? +Being in a ceremonial guard unit isn't so bad either. After all, the only value in an antique like the Mosin-Nagant...is nostalgia.
()||<震屏>:...Smack! +Tokarev slaps Mosin-Nagant square on the cheek.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You're just too nice to everyone! +You won't show how much pain you're in, even if it's tying you up in knots inside! +You should have fought with the Commander to the bitter end about the upgrade in the first place, Miss Mosin-Nagant!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Why...why did things have to end up like this...?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I'm fine... +If there's nothing else, I'll be heading back.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I'm sorry...
