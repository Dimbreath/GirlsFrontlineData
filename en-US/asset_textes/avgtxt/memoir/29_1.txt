Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Listen, it was not your fault, you just so happened to be the one who encountered the problem.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:I disagree. +She actually had to rely on a human stranger to salvage the mission – how was that different from failing the mission? +The reshuffling is obviously punishment for her blunder, plain and simple.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||:But our options were limited to begin with... +With our comms modules malfunctioning, if it hadn't been for the human's aid...
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:It is never practical to pin your hopes on “humanity”, L85. +The only thing we can truly rely on is our own strength.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||:But under such dire circumstances...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Say, we can't use our core directive as an excuse for everything. +We should've come up with a suitable solution on the spot.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||:Bren, L85, is this really the time to argue? +What's past is past. The goddess of victory will not smile upon those who refuse to move on.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...TEN...
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Sigh... +If you can ever find the time, make sure you drop in and have some tea with us.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Now don't look so sad... changing of station happens all the time. +If you want to see us, you are always welcome to come and visit us when you're on holiday. +I just hope whoever they're sending to replace you won't be a troublemaker.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...STEN...
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:May the light of victory always shine upon you, my friend.

MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏2><震屏><BIN>85</BIN>:Whoa!!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Hahahaha, still spacing out?! +You just joined a new echelon! You're not leaving a good first impression, you know?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:I... +I just remembered...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Remembered what? Did you leave your makeup case behind?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:No! +I just remembered... +There were a lot of things that I didn't get to tell the others before I left...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Ha...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:It's stupid of me to keep dwelling on this, isn't it?
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:I mean, it won't be nice of me to say, “I honestly don't get why you're so sad” to your face...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:But you just did...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Heh, we haven't been fired. We just got moved somewhere else.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:You mean we got “sent away”...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:In any case, we're still part of Griffin, so what difference does it make? +I'd be more concerned about whether there will be long queues at the cafeteria at the new place.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:I...just feel really bad... +Bren said the mission basically ended in failure because I asked a human for help... +The Commander must've thought the same, or I wouldn't have been sent to a place where I won't be a hindrance.
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Huh? So you're saying I'm also a lousy Doll because I got sent here along with you?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:N-no, that's not what I meant!
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Humph! Whatever, I don't waste my time worrying about stuff. +What's the point, anyway? They must have their reasons. +I for one don't think the Commander would call for a reshuffling over something so trivial.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:I'm...not so sure.
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Then what do you think? About the mission, I mean. +Do you believe you made the wrong decision back then?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:I... +No, I am very grateful to the human who helped me out, though I never saw him again...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:See? You already have your own answer. +Though I find it a bit unusual for a human to render aid to a Doll... Isn't it usually the other way round?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:It was a bit strange, but isn't the Commander always helping us?!
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Well, there you have it! Think about how the Commander is always taking care of us. +It's perfectly normal for Dolls to ask humans for help when we're in trouble, so why should a Doll be punished for following a human's instructions?!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:You're right... The stories we see on the news are usually about Dolls disobeying their humans or things turning out badly because a Doll decided to take matters into her own hands... +Which means...I didn't actually do anything wrong...
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:It was perfectly fine to begin with. +A human who dislikes Dolls won't even bother to acknowledge your presence. Have you ever met a human like that?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:No...all the humans I've met were very friendly. +Alright, I think I understand... There's nothing to worry about.
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Heh, that's the spirit! No point in moping about! +Now let's go see our new leader and report for duty.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We help humans, so in return, humans are also happy to help us. +Relying on humans isn't a bad thing, so...Bren was wrong! +After all...most humans are like the Commander... +That...must be the case...
