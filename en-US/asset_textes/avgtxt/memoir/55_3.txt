AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I can't believe your neural cloud is in such a mess from just a simple disconnection... +It's too fragile, even for an older Doll model...
AK12(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but will fixing it take a long time?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:It'll be fine once I run a few repair programs on the equipment. +Since we have time, I should probably perform an upgrade on you with the gear we have on hand.
AK12(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:An upgrade? Is that necessary? +A repair will be enough. If you randomly poke around with an upgrade...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:This is an order, so be obedient. +Lie down and be still. You have a lot of unused ports, so it won't take long.
AK12(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright...thank you, Miss AK-12.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:Letting someone other than Miss Persica open up my body is somewhat worrying. But given the present circumstances, I need to get rid of my weak-mindedness of the past. +It'll be alright, even if she just slaps a bunch of parts together for an upgrade... +I need to be able to fight. +I'm going to find my friends and my objective again. +I need strength for that. +I will find my enemies...and then I will destroy them!
()||<BIN>88</BIN><黑屏2>:...AK-12 begins the upgrading work with clicks and clacks.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... + ...AR-15.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:...
AR15Mod(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Apart from us...and RO and SOP-II...+...How are...the Commander...and the other Dolls doing now?
AR15Mod(3);M4A1(0)||:
()||:...AR-15 hesitates for a moment.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:It's none of our business... +They should have withdrawn, according to what AK-12 said the last time she mentioned them.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Have they withdrawn safely?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:How shall I say this... Given the situation, they probably would have taken heavy losses. +Even from an optimistic guess...
AK12(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:As I thought... +Those Sangvis scum! +It's all the Mastermind's fault... She tricked me...and because of her, everyone's... +I won't forgive them for this! I will never forgive them!!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:...
AK12(0);M4A1(0)||:
()||:...AK-12 glances over to AR-15, who sighs.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:M4A1... +I'm going to tell you the truth, but you have to stay calm.
AR15Mod(3);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:The culprit behind Griffin's defeat in this operation is not Sangvis Ferri, but the military. +From the start...it has always been a military conspiracy.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...are you saying? +But we were clearly...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:I know you're very confused, M4A1, but this is the truth. +SOP-II...and RO... It was the work of the military.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The military... +No, I don't get it... Why... +Wasn't the military behind the entire operation... Shouldn't they be...against Sangvis Ferri... +Why...did they...to RO... Just who exactly did it? Was it really someone from the military!?
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:A squad of humans from the military killed them. That much is obvious from the bullet holes and the debris they left behind. +Of course, they'll cover it up by saying they were "getting rid of out-of-control Dolls".
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:M4A1, do you know a Captain Yegor?
AR15Mod(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:He's the mastermind and culprit behind the attack on all of you. +I believe he personally shot RO635.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yegor? No, how could this be... Isn't he...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:M4A1, Yegor is the one who set up the AR Team. That much is certain.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +Yegor's the murderer...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Are you afraid? The target of your revenge is an enemy that's much, much scarier than Sangvis Ferri.
AK12(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...+If that's really true... +Then it doesn't matter who they are, whether they're Dolls...or humans... +I will kill them with my own two hands. I swear it.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Oh my, this isn't a declaration that an average Doll would make. +Anyway, the upgrade's almost complete. Don't go running off after it's done. Listen to AR-15's orders, okay?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:M4A1, our mission is to determine the motive behind this military operation. +Join us once everything is ready. You'll get your answers.
AR15Mod(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Join your team?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||<黑屏1>:We're called DEFY. Do you like the name?
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:Treachery and defiance...they go together very well. +It doesn't take much thinking for me to reach my conclusion. +If I can't bring back my comrades, then there's only one thing I must do—
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm in, as long as I can avenge RO635 and SOP-II. +I will obey orders from you and Ange until I achieve my objective.
