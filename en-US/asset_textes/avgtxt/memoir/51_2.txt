FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Miss Five-seven, here... +This is my surveillance report for today.
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Bien. Let me see. +Hmm... This is pretty good for your first time.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:M-merci... +Um... Is there anything I can improve on?
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:This report is perfectly adequate. +FF FN49, you take your assignments seriously and are very meticulous. +If I must point out something you should work on... +It would be your lack of self-confidence and the will to persist through difficulties.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Huh?
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You did very well. +That's why you should've submitted the report with more pride.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I-I see! +I will definitely work on that...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:That roommate of yours may be a bit of a simpleton, but that has its own merits. +Your complementary personalities make it perfect for the two of you to learn from each other. +I suppose that's why the Commander put you in the same team.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Is that so? +Actually, I-I'm not entirely sure how to get on with FF FNC. +Not to mention learning from her...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Did something happen between you two?
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:She's always making fun of me... +It's pretty harmless most of the time, but she doesn't seem to care at all...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:FF FNC...can indeed be impertinent. +I think she's bullying you because you never fight back. +The Commander has lectured her a couple of times but she isn't one to realize her own faults. +So in this regard...you're on your own.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:But I-I don't know what to do...
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Think of it as a long-term assignment. +If you can sort out this troublemaker, you might be able to learn a thing or two yourself.
FN49(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:But can I...really do it?
FN49(0);FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:If you want to stay in Griffin, you "have to" do it. +Like I said, have more faith in yourself. +Besides, I think you can do it... +And I have a good eye for many things.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>;FN57(0)||<黑点1><BIN>8</BIN>:Alright...Miss Five-seven. +I'll do my best...
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><黑点2><黑屏1>:Sigh... +Why must I make friends with someone like her...?
