()||<BIN>4</BIN><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...Outside the Griffin base, at the helipad.
()||<BIN>4</BIN>:A new mission is about to begin, and the helicopter is making its final pre-flight checks.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Wow, that's a pretty fancy outfit you've got there, 98.
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:You look completely different, blockhead. How does it feel?
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Well... Where should I begin? In technical terms...
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:My fire control core was replaced, more target tracking and memory functions were added, my sensory reception radius and...
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>(0)||<BIN>4</BIN>:...Hah? Wha?
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Honestly, it looks like SV-98 is still the same old SV-98. +That's good. At least we won't have to waste time getting to know a new teammate again. Everything will be as normal.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:(Groans) When you say that, it's like the upgrade made no difference at all...
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>(0)||<BIN>4</BIN>:Well, even after being upgraded, you'll be doing the same work anyway, so it's good that nothing's changed...
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Still, the Commander had high hopes for me, and if going to all the trouble of an upgrade made no difference...
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Wouldn't that be a disappointment for the Commander and all the people who put together the neural cloud upgrade package? And I'd also be letting down everyone on the team...
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Well, if you mess up again, just leave it to me.
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Cleaning up after a junior's mistakes is nothing for an elite like me.
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Ow, that hurts!
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:(Laughs) Bold of you to call yourself an elite when you leave yourself so wide open.
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:She just talks big, don't worry about it. Just stay calm and you'll be fine.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:I know. After all, live combat situations change by the second, so worrying about them now is a waste of time. Besides...
()||<BIN>4</BIN>:SV-98 is no longer frowning. Instead, she beams with a confident smile.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:I'll do my best to take the enemy out, with one shot for every kill I make.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:As for any who slip the net, SVD can help take care of them for me. We'll each do our jobs and complete the mission together.
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:...Such bravado, junior!
SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Still, relying on me is the best decision you've made.
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Oh my, to think you'd come to send us off in person, Commander.
OTs14(0)<Speaker>OTs-14</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Squad, salute.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Though I had many things to do, I made some time to send off the echelon that was about to head off to the frontline.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Of course, it's mostly because I had too much on my schedule last night and couldn't be there when SV-98 came back from the factory after her neural upgrade.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Personally, I was curious about how she's changed, and I also wanted to ask her how she felt about it all.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:Still, after seeing the squad salute to me in unison, I realize that I already have the answer.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:I won't let you down, Commander!
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:There is no longer any doubt in SV-98's eyes.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN>:I return her salute. It would seem I had been worrying for nothing, and there's nothing more I need to say.
SV98Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><黑屏1>:I'm sure that from today onwards, she will come to like herself more, as well as her friends and this world.
