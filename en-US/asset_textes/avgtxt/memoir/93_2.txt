IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...I can't hear any more gunfire. +Is the fight... over?
慌张的女声()<Speaker>Panicky female voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Are you alright, IDW?! +Bren... what should we do? She's very badly damaged!
IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Hmm... who's that...? +I can't... open my eyes...
高傲的女声()<Speaker>Snobbish female voice</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:+Losing her neural cloud record the moment she came... What a handful... +Here, I have a quick repair kit. Fix her up.
()||<BIN>3</BIN><睁眼><黑屏2>:IDW opens her eyes.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Thank goodness. She looks alright now...
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:Did we win, L85A1?
IDW(1);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Of course we did... but don't worry about that now. +You almost didn't make it... I was really worried.
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:I wouldn't really care, but I sure as hell don't want to hear her introduce herself again.
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Don't say that, Bren. She was covering us...
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Those who overestimate themselves would only cause trouble when they try to play the hero.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:I... didn't want to cause trouble for everyone. +I was just trying to fulfill my duty as a bodyguard...
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:But can you actually protect anyone? +You almost got destroyed in that little fight.
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:I suppose you got kicked out of your last echelon because you're so useless.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:I...I'm not useless! +Besides, it's a bodyguard's job to do everything within their power to protect everyone!
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Only these with strength can have the right to speak of protecting others.
IDW(1)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Bren, where are you going?!
IDW(1)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:The captain needs some help. I'm heading over. +I'll leave this deadweight to you.
()||<BIN>3</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Bren storms off.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:IDW... don't mind her. Bren has always been like that... +Can you walk? I'll help you up.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:Ahaha... I'm fine.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:It's true... I'm pretty weak... and unappealing... +The last echelon I was in didn't pay much attention to me either because I couldn't help them much...
IDW(1);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:But you were very brave. +I wouldn't dare to even think about charging out and drawing enemy fire like that.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:Even if I look useless... I still want to help. +Why was I even made if I'm so useless?
IDW(1);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:The reason why we're made... I'm not too sure about such things. +But I think the fact that we're here means Griffin has a use for us.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:You really think so?
IDW(1);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:Otherwise we'd have been sent off to be downgraded to civilian Dolls, right?
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN>:Yeah... +Thanks for comforting me, L85A1. I'll work harder to make myself useful!
IDW(1);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN>:We're teammates, of course we'll help each other. +Get yourself repaired and join us in battle soon.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>3</BIN><黑屏1>:Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can!
