()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>168</BIN><黑屏2>:...
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:The remaining guys are all running away! +We won!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:You... Do you know what you're doing?!
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I saved you!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I wasn't talking about that. +Why did you do this to yourself? And where did you get that gun from?
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You helped my friends and I escape from the gang's control, so I needed to repay you properly. +When you blew up those bastards' server, I took the opportunity to hack their bank accounts now that they didn't have a firewall, and siphoned out all their credits~ +I used the credits to modify my appearance and got some gear on the black market. +Although I have to say, finding a weapon and an outfit that resembled yours was a lot of work.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ah... I was going to ask why those gangsters were coming after me so hard. So it was YOUR fault!
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Ehhhh? Really?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Honestly...We'll just leave that aside for now. +Look at the gun you're holding; do you have any idea of the kind of abyss you've just jumped into? +Do you know what kind of price a Doll has to pay to put their gun down? Can you really take it?
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Then I won't put my gun down. +I'll use the rest of my life to point it at anyone against you!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why are you doing this? Why didn't you just go and start a new life for yourself?
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:... +The others and I...we've been illegal Dolls in this city for a very long time. +But nobody cared about what happened to us. +All the humans, all the normal Dolls... They were all content to just overlook the crimes which took place where they couldn't see.+You were the only one who said, "I can't tolerate this." And you also said that I was like you... +That's why I couldn't abandon you! Since we're alike, then we ought to support each other!
UMP45(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't need support. +I only did it to satisfy myself. Saving you was incidental. Don't get too full of yourself.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But yet we still met here! Isn't that fate? +There must have been a reason for us to encounter each other!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No good will come of being with me.
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What could be worse than the things I went through before this? Plus, I want to go on an adventure with you! +Although I'm very weak now, I'll work hard so that I can become as strong as you, Sis!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:W...what? Did you call me "Sis"?
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yeah! Didn't you say we were very much alike? +When you take a closer look, we really do look alike! Doesn't that mean we can be sisters? +And look! I went and picked out this weapon! +I'm UMP9, and you're UMP45, so doesn't that make us sisters?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Even if you give yourself a makeover and carry a similar gun, the two of us are nothing alike. +You have no idea what I've been through, so don't just up and declare that we're buddies. +Thank you for your help just now, but you should still—
UMP9(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=50>That just means you've got a past or something, right?!</size>+<size=50>I...I can have something like that too!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Slash— +Reina carves a scar over her eye with the knife she's carrying.
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:How's that? +We're the same now, aren't we?

UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Pfffffffffhahaha...
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:What's so funny?! I'm being really serious here! +If that's not enough, I can cut my other eye too!
UMP9(4);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's not the same...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:What..?
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Look, your devotion is admirable, but you cut the wrong eye.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:...Eh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<震屏>:Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh?! +I was looking at you and then I cut downward...
UMP9(4);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But you're facing me.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Errrrr... What should I do... +This means we have different pasts now... What should I do...
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hey, UMP9.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Don't tell me... I need to cut myself again...?
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:UMP9.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:...Huh? +What did you just call me?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Your name is UMP9, isn't it? +Visual modules aren't cheap. You shouldn't do something like that.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:You called me UMP9... +Does that mean...
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We should go. We made a big ruckus just now, so the cops will be here soon.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:A-alright!
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't care what kind of life you had before this, but you'd better be prepared for the days to come. +You aren't in the peaceful, boring world you used to live in anymore.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:That's fine... It's not as though the past is always better than the future. +And I'm sure that if there are any problems, you'll be able to take care of them, 45!
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Sighs) +If only that were the case... I wouldn't have fallen this far.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:...I still want to ask, though... How did you get your scar?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You're better off not knowing about that. +But if you help me fulfill my wish one day... +Then I'll tell you.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:What's so difficult about that?
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I'm standing by your side precisely so that I can make it happen!
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN><白屏2>:(Groans)
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh my, are you awake?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:45... +Where's Dier?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:He's taking care of 416 now. +Did you have a good rest? How do you feel?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<震屏>:...Oh? +Whoa!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't know how I've become stronger, but I do feel stronger!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Quit lying to yourself. +You can't discern electronic warfare upgrades by external appearances.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Then I'll see how much stronger I am in actual combat! +Oh yeah, also...I had a very nostalgic dream.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ha, then I'm sure it wasn't about anything good. +Since you're up, go finish the rest of your preparations. It's about time for us to head out.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Mkay— +...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No...it's nothing.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:That's right... +What I've always wanted is to help 45 fulfill her wish. +I'll do it, then I'll listen as she tells me everything about her past from her own lips. +Ah, I'm looking forward to that day.
