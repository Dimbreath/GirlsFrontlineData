G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...So that was what happened during the previous operation. Human bodies are very fragile, so do pay attention to that when carrying out missions that involve protecting your target.
G36Mod(0);TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Which means we won't be able to charge with our target in tow during evacuation?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;TT33(0)||:Absolutely not, that is way too risky. +If your target ends up getting injured, your entire mission will have been for naught.
G36Mod(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Seriously... Humans really could use some physical enhancement.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;P7(0)||:But that's just the way they are, and it is our duty to protect them. +Isn't it the same with the Commander?
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;P7(0)||:You're not even part of this assignment, P7, so why are you complaining? +If you have so much free time for idle chatter, perhaps you should spend it at the training ground.
StG44(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I'm just listening in! There's no harm in sharing our experience with each other. Gr G36 and Tokarev clearly aren't bothered.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;P7(0)||:I don't mind people joining our conversation, as long as they don't drop empty seed husks everywhere...
StG44(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I only dropped like a couple, you hardly have to freak out about that! +Besides, it's not like I'm not going to tidy up later...
StG44(0);TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Now stop arguing. Try to get along. +Thank goodness I had this chat with you, Gr G36, or I might really do something stupid on my mission... +(Sighs) But I'm still a bit worried... I'd feel a lot better if StG44 could come along.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;TT33(0)||:Hm... I'd love to, but I'm not on the roster. +We all have our orders, so do your best, Tokarev.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:True, I'm sure the Commander has a reason for this arrangement. +Thanks for the talk, now I'd better be off!
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You're very welcome. If you have any more questions in the future, feel free to come to me.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Right, I've got to get going too. +Oh yeah, I need to tidy up...
P7(0);StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Just leave that to me.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;StG44(0)||:You don't need any help?
P7(0);StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Don't worry about it. It's just a quick sweep. +Having too many hands would only make it less efficient.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;StG44(0)||:Alright then, I suppose you haven't got much work to do anyway. +I'm going. Bye~
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:... +Yeah, see you.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:In that case, I shall take my leave as well. Thank you for lending us your room, StG44.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:...Don't mention it. See you around.
()||<黑点2>:StG44 sits down quietly in her room. As she watches the other Dolls depart one after the other, she unconsciously tightens her fists.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Are you alright?
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Huh...?! +You're still here, Gr G36?
StG44(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:You seem troubled. +Is it because of the recent mission roster?
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:...It's nothing, really. As Tokarev has said, the Commander must have a reason for this arrangement. +Um, do you mind sharing some of your chores with me today as well?
StG44(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Of course not... These are the areas that need to be cleaned, if you'd please.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Got it. Thank you, Gr G36.
StG44(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:If it really troubles you so much, it might be a good idea to speak to the Commander directly.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:...Right. +Thank you, Gr G36, really.
StG44(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(...She doesn't plan on going, does she.)</color> +Then I'll leave you to it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>18</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After seeing Gr G36 off, StG44 starts cleaning up the room.
StG44(0)||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>(I've been the only one here at the dorm for days.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(Gr G36 was right. Maybe I should really go talk to the Commander or Miss Kalina...)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(...But that would only take up their time.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(The Commander is always right. The Commander has gone through hell and back with us. The Commander is in all my neural cloud memories.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(If the Commander isn't putting me on the mission roster, there must be a reason.)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>A reason that couldn't be said to my face but is enough for the Commander to withhold assignments from me...</color> +...
StG44(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:StG44 stops in her tracks and stands rooted to the spot for a long while.
StG44(0)||:Have I...become utterly useless?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Haha, this can't be further from the truth! +If you start having such ideas, the Commander will never pay you any mind!
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><Shake>||:...?! +Who's that...?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:O lowly Tactical Doll, look up. +I don't blame you for not noticing my high and mighty existence.
StG44(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:...
StG44(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:StG44 raises her head and looks toward the source of the voice...
