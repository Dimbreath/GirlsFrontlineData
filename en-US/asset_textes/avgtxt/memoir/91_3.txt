BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:Huh...well, you should know what'll happen when that thing blows up. +Although simply cutting you in two goes against my personal principles... +I have a mission to carry out, so I can't leave you to wreak havoc behind my back.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:(Pants) Then come at me if you can! +See if I won't blow you up with all these Dummies!

BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:That's not what I'm asking. +Why did you abandon your friends at the door and run into a place like this by yourself?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><震屏>:Because I'm not like what P7 said I was! +I'm not the sort of person who needs to cling to others! +I can get things done, even if I'm alone!
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:... +Is that so... +Alright, then. You've done very well. +However, all your rashness has accomplished is cause trouble for your little friends. +They will all die at the doorway to this place because you insist on doing this.

P7(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...While I should inquire further into why exactly you went out by yourselves in the middle of the night, I guess I'll just have to let that slide for now given the circumstances. +As for Viking...MP-446...
