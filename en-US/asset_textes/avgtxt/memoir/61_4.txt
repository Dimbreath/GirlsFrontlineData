TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:So yeah... We completed the mission, but it really was touch-and-go.
TT33(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:That was a bit negligent on your part. +Unlike Dolls, one careless mistake is all it takes to inflict fatal injuries on humans.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:I will keep that in mind on similar missions in the future. +(Sighs) If I had StG44 with me, it would probably have gone a lot more smoothly... +So, I heard she's been given a new assignment?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||>:That's right, a mission given by the Commander in person. +She should be returning...right about now.
()||<SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1>:The door opens not a second too soon.
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:I'm back!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Oh, welcome back!
TT33(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Gr G36 only nods silently at StG44, who returns the gestures with a smile.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:I heard you got a neural upgrade... But you don't look too different?
TT33(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:It does look pretty similar, but this uniform is brand new. +And my mission went very well!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:I see. Then congratulations, StG44. +You look very cool in your new uniform.
TT33(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Thanks! I asked the Commander, and I can report for duty and resume my daily duties right away. +So let's keep looking out for one another.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Certainly. Always happy to work with you.
TT33(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:I'm glad to hear it.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:So what's the plan? +If you have some time, can we sit down for a chat? I'm quite curious about this neural upgrade...
TT33(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:Sure thing. +But I need to visit a place first. I'll be back in a second.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After bidding Tokarev a hasty farewell, StG44 exits the dorm and tiptoes down the corridor.

STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What's that noise? I can hear something from around the corner...</color>
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Heheh... I'm a noble angel! +You lowly Dolls...
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Great, she's here!</color>
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>Somewhat Familiar Voice</Speaker>||:...Ugh... That doesn't sound grandiose enough. +I should phrase it differently...
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:...
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:StG44 swiftly turns the corner.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In the storage closet, P7 is sitting with her back to the door and muttering to herself, an unidentifiable object on her lap.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:“Then I'll give you a taste of the power of Heaven!” +That feels pretty good, then...
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:So should I call you Angel...or P7?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>;STG44Mod(0)||:...Huh?
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:I knew the angel was fake, but I certainly didn't expect it to be you...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:I have no idea what you're on about. +How dare you slander an adorable Doll...
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:What's that underneath your dress?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Huh? Nothing whatsoever.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||<震屏>:Hey, don't go flipping up a girl's dress! +Outrageous! Wicked! Hey!!
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||:The Commander mentioned something about a missing drone. +This is the missing Shield Fairy, isn't it?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:...Oh, fine. I'll admit it, okay?! +I just wanted to prank you.
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:...StG44?
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:StG44 continues to stare wordlessly at P7.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:Well, say something... +...Sorry if I've gone a bit too far...
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:In any case, the angel's advice did prove to be valuable. +Even if the Shield Fairy wasn't actually involved, I would still like to express my gratitude to you. +If it hadn't been for what you'd said, I would never have pulled myself together and worked to improve myself. +So thank you, P7.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)||:I just pulled a prank on you. It's kind of embarrassing now that you're thanking me so solemnly! +Still, I suppose it doesn't matter...
P7(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...But, a prank is still a prank. +I'm going to avenge myself, P7. Take this!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...Huh?! Hey, you were thanking me just a second ago?! No, wait! Stay back, StG44! +Wait, don't pick me up by the collar! Where are you taking me?! Ahhhhhh!
STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You can't become a powerful angel without undergoing some difficult trials. +So, Noble Angel... +It's your turn to do some special training.
