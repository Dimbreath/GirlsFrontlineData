M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<BIN>18</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:So, you know the rules. This time, you decide the game, and I name the bet. Okay?
M1873(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:This is why I dislike you lot of... (Sighs)
M1873(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Fine. Let's decide on who gets to serve as the Commander's adjutant tomorrow through a combat simulation.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2>:We each lead a team and run the same program simultaneously until all waves are down. Whoever has more kills wins. As for the stakes—
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;PM(0)||:As always, the winner gets half a month worth of cola and the opportunity to accompany the Commander's field trip tomorrow.
M1873(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Agreed.

M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Looks like Makarov's team has started in the west. We'd better hurry too. +Still, I seem to have been dealt a nice hand, don't you think, CZ75?
M1873(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:You may have more experience here, but you're way too slow. +When is this gonna be over if you keep dawdling like this?
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:I may have a good hand, but I'm playing with really unpleasant people. +Then... +Whoa?!
M1873(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:(A bullet slices past SAA's hat.)
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Phew... Thank goodness for my good reflexes... +Damn. They need to pay for that!
M1873(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Tsk...! +Over here, SAA. They seem to be armed with suppressors.
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:That didn't seem like a simulated Sangvis unit. It was a Griffin T-Doll! +Makarov's team is resorting to sneak attacks just to win the wager...but that's playing right into my hand!
M1873(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:This whole wager is completely unnecessary... Wait. No way. Not you too?
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:They have shown their hand. We also have to do what it takes to win! +The position of adjutant and cola. They're both mine and I don't plan on giving up either!
M1873(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:The Commander will probably cry at the thought of being considered on the same level as cola. So, what are we gonna do?
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||:I noticed last time that there's a bug in the simulation to our three o'clock, in the West, that drops you into the Neural Cloud Corridor. +We can draw them there and...
M1873(0);CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:That's a good plan. +Leave them on the other side while we finish the combat simulation as fast as we can. Then we'll win.
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;CZ75(0)||<黑屏1>:Of course! Then let's get started!

TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Keep your eyes open. Aim properly before you fire. +Say, you may be the leader, Makarov, but you're way too reckless.
TT33(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Sorry. Let's... +Hmm? They're moving towards where the bug is.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Bug? What bug?
TT33(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I thought SAA didn't notice, but she's more observant than I thought. +She's trying to catch our attention and arouse our suspicion so we'll follow and see what she's up to.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Then we should stick to our plan and destroy the Sangvis units here fir...
TT33(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Nyet. If she wants to gamble, it'd be a shame if I fold. +I know exactly where the bug leads...
TT33(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's take advantage of the location and leave them stranded there.
