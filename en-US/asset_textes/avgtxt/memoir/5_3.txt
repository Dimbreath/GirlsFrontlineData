M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:My partners for today's mission are those two newcomers... +Honestly, who arranged this anyway...
M1895(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +M1895 thinks quietly for a while, and then removes her hat.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<黑点1>:After all that training, I should have grown by quite a bit. +I don't need this hat any more... +I'll show them my true strength today!

P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:We've spotted the S.F. comms post. +Once we take it, our objectives for the first phase will be complete.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Alright then, I'll lead the attack. +This is a good range for a charge; let's get started!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:What's with you?
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I don't mind if you want to commit suicide, but please do it by yourself.
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:We're all armed with handguns. We don't stand much of a chance if we charge in recklessly. +We'll take massive damage even if we manage to take the post... so a full-frontal attack is not suitable for us.
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That's common sense. Didn't you know that, oh dear senior of ours?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:Eh...
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Right, that's enough. I'll take charge of this operation. +Everyone, please act as I direct.
()||<黑点2>:...Ten minutes later.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:All enemies on the perimeter have been wiped out. +The enemies inside the comms post shouldn't have noticed us.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:(The operation's gone very smoothly...) +(Looks like their way of fighting is better suited to modern warfare.)
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Very good, let's keep up the pace. +...Prep your flashbangs, we're going for a dynamic entry.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:Oh, oh! An assault, then?
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:This should be your forte, senior. +Please eliminate all the enemies within the comms post as quickly as possible.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||<黑点1>:Leave it to me! +(I won't miss this chance to show my strength!)

P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Victory</BGM><BIN>1</BIN>:This mission went well. Thank you for your cooperation, everyone.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hehe, the base's idol ought to be able to achieve this much!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:What's wrong, senior? +It's time to savor our victory.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:This operation has made me look at you in a new light. +Your new ways of doing things are very practical indeed...
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Thank you. Gaining your approval pleases me as well, senior.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:So... would you mind telling me more about them after we go back? +Even an old dog should still be able to learn new tricks from time to time.
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Oho? The antique's managed to see reason at last?
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:...Please don't mind her, senior. +I would be glad to share what I know with you.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:Relax, I won't split hairs with a kid. +It's a deal then. Let's pick a good time to chat when we get back!
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hey! Who're you calling a kid?!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:Obviously, it's the one who calls herself an idol.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:How dare you call me a kid! +Wait a minute, get back here, you midget antique!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...Y-You called me a midget?! +I can't just pretend I didn't hear that!
()||:P99 looks at the feuding pair as they vanish into the distance, and sighs.
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:While it's good that they're getting along now... +It looks like they're overdoing things a little.
