SOP-II()<Speaker>SOP-II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What... IS this place?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:SOP-II looks around the empty space.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We're inside a certain large database.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Eh? RO, you're back to normal? +No, wait... Am I on Level II now?
SOPIIDamage(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yup. Miss Persica just dumped us in here.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Oh, I remember now.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:For some reason I have a bad feeling about this place...
()||:...Incoming transmission.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:Looks like the two of you have successfully connected to my neural cloud database.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:What are we going to do next, Miss Persica?
SOPIIDamage(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:RO's going to wait here for her new body. +SOP-II can go back once the separation is complete.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:Tsk... So now I don't have a body at all, huh... Forget it, it's still better than being in the Dinergate...
RO635(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:You'll be parting soon, so best say your goodbyes while you can. +The separation program will activate in 5 minutes. You won't be able to see each other for a while after that.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A while... How long will that be?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<通讯框>:That depends on how long the two of you can hold out.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Eh? What do you mean...?
Weaver(1)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I sensed something so I came over to take a look. I didn't expect it to be you two.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What...? You, you're...
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Maggots of the AR Team... +I've missed you.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hi~ Don't forget me, I'm here too!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hey! What's going on?!
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What are these Sangvis dorks doing here?!
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:Griffin transferred their neutral clouds to me in order to put them to better use. +Play nice, you all~
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Eh? Hang on, is this some kind of joke?!
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Humph... Well, it won't be a problem if it's just you. +Let me shred your neural cloud, RO635!
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I won't let you bully RO! +You're the ones who're going to get shredded!
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:Nobody's going to be shredding anyone. That would cause trouble for me. +Alright, SOP-II, time to say goodbye to RO.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:But these two Sangvis...
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:It'll be fine, they can't do much inside my database. +Besides, don't you have faith in RO's skills?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:What does this have to do with skills?! +Hey! Persica! Are you going to leave just like that?!
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:RO...
SOPIIDamage(2);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Even if you don't believe in RO, you should believe in me. +RO will be perfectly safe here. I guarantee it.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Al... alright, then. +If you say so, Miss Persica...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Eh? What? Wait! Don't! Don't leave me alone, you two!
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Now die, Griffin scum! +C'mon, you too, Architect!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh? Eh... fine, fine. We won't lose this time since it's two on one, right?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Come... come back, SOP-II! +At least help me take care of them first...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ahhhh! Stay away from me you Sangvis bastards—!
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll be heading off for now, RO! I'll come back to check in on you after my body's fixed!

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Is this really the time to be worried about someone else?
()||:Persica wheels out a trolley with all kinds of machinery and gadgets on it.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Miss Persica... these things look kind of dangerous, don't they?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Now, without further ado, let's get started!
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Miss Persica... +You're really going to upgrade me and not scrap me, right?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Well, in order to upgrade you, I must first take you apart. +Don't worry, I've taken the necessary steps so this won't hurt. Trust me~
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:A dangerous smile spreads across Persica's face.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Whimpers) That face isn't assuring at all... +Miss Persica's scarier than the Military right now... +(Sighs) What's going to become of me after this...?
