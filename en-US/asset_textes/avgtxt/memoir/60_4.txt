()||<BIN>161</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑屏2>:The Dolls are fully armed and equipped, waiting for the helicopters which shuttle back and forth to take them to their destination.
()||:And these Dolls who are about to head into the fray rub shoulders with the Dolls who've just returned from completing their missions.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:It's just one mission after another... +Ever since the Commander came back, we've been buried in missions.
AK74U(0);9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Isn't that a good thing? I seem to recall someone complaining about how we were bench-warming substitutes. +Now not only are we running logistics, we're also doing recon and sweeping the battlefield. We can't get a second's rest.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;9A91(0)||:But we had a lot of freedom when we were substitutes! +Did whoever it was that grouped me and 9A-91 into a mook squad just to make up numbers actually expect anything out of us?
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Who are you calling a mook squad...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Perhaps you can blame it on me. After all, the Commander did say my new body would need a bit of a break in.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You... Right, this is just too much, you didn't even say a word to us before going for such a radical upgrade.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Do you think this body doesn't suit me?
()||:9A-91 and AK-74U stop and give AS Val a once-over.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Well, that's not what I mean...
AK74U(0);9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:...I didn't look too closely when you came back this morning.+Still, I only realized how much you've changed after actually going on a mission with you, AS Val.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:That's right, I couldn't recognize you at first.+If you hadn't come up and said hi to us, we might have mistaken you for someone else and not met up.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Da, I wasn't too used to it at first.+But now I can feel the power coursing through this new body. It can carry heavier gear and my vision's clearer now.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The new AS Val standing in front of 9A-91 and AK-74U looks more imposing than before.+The gun she's holding has been modified and calibrated, and the glasses on her nose are gone.+There are countless more changes on top of that, but the one which draws the most attention is still...
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>But of course, now that AS Val's been refurbished with IOP's latest technology, her specs aren't those of an ordinary civilian Doll anymore!</color>
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:...
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:...
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:...
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Surprised by the capabilities of this new body?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>IOP is now offering personalized upgrade services. If you're interested, please dial...</color>
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:...Uh, I might not have made this clear before, so I'm going to repeat myself. +Could you not butt in when the three of us are talking?
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Eh?! But I'm AS Val's friend! I'd like to join your conversations too!</color>
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:A friend of my friend isn't necessarily my friend too.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:You're a rookie who just joined our team, but you're not addressing us politely and you didn't even treat your seniors to lunch.+No matter how you think about it, you're being too cocky as a newcomer. It would seem you've antagonized AK-74U in particular.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is hazing! I'm going to lodge a complaint with HR!</color>
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:AS Val, was this guy always so noisy? I never got that feeling from him in the past.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Ahaha... His personality was written based on my opinions, but I didn't expect a little brother to be so annoying.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>How rude! How can you call me annoying?! I, Misha, am the latest model of learning AI!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>My database contains the answers to all questions related to Tactical Doll hardware and software operation...</color>
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Maybe AS Val has always been this chatty deep down.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:...I don't think so, right? I feel like I could get along with AS Val because she didn't say much. 
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:It does make sense.+After all, there were some things that I could never come out and talk to the two of you about, which was why I always had Misha by my side.+To some extent, Misha represents all the parts of me that I was afraid to show...+...So when you think about it, it felt like a miracle that I was able to befriend you in the past.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Huh...then what about now? Can you still share your secrets with such a talkative companion?
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No problem at all! I can support Dolls in all kinds of ways now, whether through psychological counseling or simply by lending an ear to her troubles.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>And I guarantee my lips will be sealed, so bring it on, Big Sis!</color>
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:AS Val stares at Misha for a while, then she speaks her mind.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I guess there are some things I'll never be able to talk about after all.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But why?! Please believe in me! Or believe in the Misha that believes in you!</color>
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:That's because...there should be give and take between friends.+If I simply dump my grievances onto you, then you're nothing more than a punching bag.+I want to be your friend, and I want to be Misha's friend.+So...there are some things that I should keep to myself.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Then what's the point? From what you're saying, this noisy little fellow will never be able to be the Misha of the past.+He's basically an ad-spouting mechanical plush toy...
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:That's fine. I don't want to turn back time. I'm very happy with how things are now.+I once thought that I had to discard my old self if I wanted to grow up, but looking back now, there is nothing that I need to throw away.
()||:As she hears this, AK-74U stiffens and stops in her tracks.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Throwing away the past and whatnot... I didn't expect to hear you say something like that, AS Val.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Well, you still have to live your life no matter how it goes, right?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:That's true. You have to live it, through all the good and the bad.+Things may not always go your way, but that doesn't mean everything will turn out badly either...
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Exactly. Things aren't always bad. 
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Er...so anyway, what you meant just now is that I'm still your friend, Big Sis?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm really not used to beating around the bush.</color>
()||:The three Dolls once again look at Misha, who is snug in AS Val's bosom.+After a few seconds of silence, AK-74U can no longer contain her laughter.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Da, da, let's welcome our new friend. We have a rule here - new friends buy lunch.
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:New friends also have to tidy up the dorm for a week. I'll leave that to you, Misha.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:The old Misha valiantly sacrificed himself by taking a bullet for me. I now dub you Misha II, and I hope you will not dishonor his great name.+As a friend, you shouldn't have any problems stepping into the breach for the sake of your other friends, right?
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Wait a minute, wait a minute, these don't sound like requests that real friends would make?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure this really isn't hazing?</color>
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:I'll get you a bulletproof vest, so don't worry.+It's a shame that we won't have any combat during this recon mission, but I won't treat my friends poorly; next time, I'll let you watch the fighting from a VIP seat.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>However capable your new body may be, please avoid unnecessary wear and tear!</color>
9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, do they really have bulletproof vests in his size?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:We'll ask Kalina if she has a 3D printer or something. We should be able to make one easily.+If I'm not wrong, there are some bulletproof resins which can be used as raw materials, right?
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Sounds like a good idea. We'll do that.
ASVALMod(0)<Speaker>Misha</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Safety first! Don't do silly things, Big Sis!</color>

()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:There were three bears in the forest, and they had recently made a new friend.+Though their lives weren't too peaceful, they had to live them anyway.+And Baby Bear discovered...that although she had lost something, there were also things that she had not lost yet, and new things that she had yet to encounter.
