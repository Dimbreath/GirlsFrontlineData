()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>80</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:A week later, at the Griffin base. +In the café.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Do you serve alcohol?
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:This is a café, nothing more and nothing less, so no, I'm afraid we don't serve alcohol.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>||:Then two flat whites for the Commander and me, please.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Sure.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Commander, had you known about Dushevnaya all along?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... <c>I have looked into the personal history of most Dolls under my command. <c>I wonder.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<分支>1</分支>:Then you must've seen quite a few things. +Maybe even some secrets that aren't meant for anyone's eyes?
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||<分支>2</分支>:I quite like it when you talk in riddles.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Then I suppose you already know why I'm here. +I did wonder why I was hired so readily...
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Your capability and experience were what mattered at the end of the day.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I guess so. +I hear that Du...KSVK's neural upgrade went very smoothly.
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:She came to me and said she could finally face up to the past. +"I am who I am because I have the courage to embrace the past and the determination to grow stronger." +Then she set off.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Haha...that was a brilliant impression. That does sound like something she would say, and in the end, she did it. +What a good girl.
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Our initial concern might have been unnecessary.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Not exactly. It was wise to have delayed her application by a week, don't you think? +If I had just gone up to her and told her the truth, she wouldn't have believed me.
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How devious of you.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:I'm just speaking from experience. +As you know, after she ran away, I found her many times... +She couldn't have lasted too long in this brutal world with that body of hers. I may have saved her once, but I'm not always there to do that.
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:According to IOP's records, when they acquired her, her body was severely damaged, but her neural cloud was fully intact.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:She did her best to keep her own memories safe.
DP12(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:She managed to grow so strong all thanks to what happened in her past. +You don't have to be so worried anymore. Right now, she...
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Right now, I'm a completely new Doll.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Wow, that's a surprise.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;KSVK(7)||:Another cup of coffee?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Thanks, Springfield! Just an orange juice for me, please.
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;KSVK(7)||:No problem.
KSVK(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Welcome back.
KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Hello, Commander...and DP-12.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||:Yes, welcome back. +I didn't expect you to go with this appearance.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I think this form suits me the best. +One should neither forget the past nor fear the future. +I am KSVK as well as Dushevnaya. I have my friends, and I have the Commander.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||:I'm so glad.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:I also have you, Helena.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||:...Gosh, at least warn me before you say something like that. +But the same goes for me. As long as I have you and everyone at Griffin, I'm content.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:By the way... I'd like to ask you for a favor, Commander. +Please keep this safe for me.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A letter? Very few would write paper letters these days.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Yes, that's why it means the world to me. +It would get damaged in battle too easily, so I would like to leave it in your care for safekeeping.
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Certainly.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||:Do you ever plan on writing a reply?
DP12(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Isn't it nice to have family living elsewhere? +Such thoughts and sentiments should be treasured.
DP12(0)<Speaker>DP-12</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>;KSVK(7)||:I'm sure she'd be very proud of you. Having a granddaughter who fights as the shining beacon in a brave new world sounds pretty impressive, don't you think?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;KSVK(7)||:Your coffees and orange juice.
M1903Cafe(0);KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:What's this?
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>;KSVK(7)||:An extra celebratory dessert on the house – specially prepared for KSVK's triumphant return.
KSVK(7)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Thank you. +Then to my friends, the past, and whatever the future may hold!
()<Speaker>Everyone</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Cheers!
