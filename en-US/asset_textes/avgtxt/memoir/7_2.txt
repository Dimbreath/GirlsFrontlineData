()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...Afternoon. +In a hallway inside the Griffin base.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Something urgent? What's so urgent you have to wait for a Doll to come out of detention?
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:You have the nerve to complain? +Then why did you sell our supplies in the first place?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Because it's profitable, simple as that.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:You...!
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:OTs-12 eyes are still cheerful, though they are now tinged with with exasperation.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:You're always going on about personal savings. Just stop buying random crap, then you'll have your savings.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:What's the point in saving up if I can't buy things? +Besides, shopping is my only hobby. You know that.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:But you can't just steal supplies from the base and sell them... +Good thing it was only some food and small furniture, so the Commander only put you in detention for a few days because of your good service record...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:I wish it was just simple detention.
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin rolls her eyes to stop OTs-12's long-winded lecture.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:You wouldn't be able to stand it either if you were also forced to answer a bunch of random questions asked by some random machine every time you come back from a mission. +<size=35>I'm a Griffin warrior, of course I'll always fight for Griffin, it's just... You know...</size>
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin's voice trails off. +OTs-12 lets out a sigh. She puts an arm over Stechkin's shoulders and gently guides her out of the building.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Just apologize to the Commander and admit you were wrong.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:I know I shouldn't have stolen the supplies... +And I deserved to be punished for my mistake, but don't expect me to relish the process.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:The Commander apparently isn't going to take any other disciplinary action against you. +We all tried our best to plead for leniency, not to mention you've made great contributions in battles...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Contributions, contributions, just give me a break... I told you, I'm a Griffin warrior, that's the only reason why... +It's exactly why I was only locked up for a few days. +They've apparently built a protocol that forces me to “put Griffin's survival above all else” into my neural cloud. This protocol even butted in while I was taking the baseline test and spoke on my behalf...
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker><Shake>||:Huh? But don't you care about Griffin's survival?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Of course I do! I wouldn't be staying here if I didn't care about Griffin. +But I could've said it without being coerced by some kind of defense mechanism.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Huh? That doesn't add up... +You say you care about the Griffin, yet you still went and stole our supplies. +I don't think it's unreasonable for them to give you an additional protocol...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin shrugs off OTs-12's arm and strides angrily away.
OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker><Shake>||:Hey, wait up! +Look, I don't want to argue... So what are you planning to do now?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin stops in her tracks and lets OTs-12 link arms with her again.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What am I planning to do? Save up, of course. I'm planning to save up lots and lots of money.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker><Shake>||:Oh boy. Y-you aren't going to steal more stuff, are you?
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin rolls her eyes dramatically.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:If anything's keeping you from getting more assignments, it's your poor comprehension skills. +It was wrong to steal, didn't I just admit that? +I won't make and be punished for the same mistake twice.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Then...?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:From now on, I'm going to work hard and save up, but not just so I can go shopping. +I must first get myself a neural upgrade, then I'll get rid of the protocol that they forced onto me.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:N-neural upgrade? But that costs a fortune!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Exactly. This is a huge endeavor that will take some proper planning...
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I personally don't think the protocol matters all that much.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:It does matter! +I don't...want someone or something to make such decisions for me... +Am I not even entitled to making such basic choices? +Even if I have a history of misdemeanors, I still want to be myself.
APS(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:OTs-12 stares at Stechkin with great concern.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:You don't understand, do you? You dork... +Let me put it this way – if I were equipped with a self-destruct protocol, and the safety of the base were compromised... +I would want to activate the self-destruct protocol myself, out of my own free will, and not because of some ridiculous Laws of Robotics.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I see... But I do hope it'll never come to that, especially not when we're in the same squad.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Don't worry, even if it really comes to that, I'll warn you well ahead of time. I don't want you to be anywhere near me when I explode. +If you're damaged in the explosion, your repair expenses will most definitely be on my head. +Hm...I think I'll signal you by saying something I obviously don't mean...
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:OTs-12 nods thoughtfully.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:But... +You're always saying things you don't mean. Sometimes I can't even tell if you're being serious or not...
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin lets out a chuckle.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Ha, nonsense. I'm always dead serious when I need to be. +Right, we've gone off on a huge tangent. You said you had something urgent to discuss. What is it?
APS(0);OTs12(0)||:
()||:Stechkin turns to look at OTs-12, whose eyes are still brimming with good cheer.
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I believe you'll find this good news. +The Commander is sending the two of us on a secret mission. We're leaving tonight.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(0)||:Good news? Secret mission?
APS(0);OTs12(0)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right! According to the Commander, it's quite a dangerous mission, but the pay will be commensurate with the level of difficulty. +With our compatibility on the battlefield, you and I are the perfect candidates for this mission! +This can kick-start your grand saving plan. Everything will be fine!
