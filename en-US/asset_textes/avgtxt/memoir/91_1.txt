P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe, catch me if you can! +Hey! Everyone! I learned Viking's big secret!
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Hm? What is it? Tell me, tell me!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Viking's secret? ...That sounds kind of fun.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<震屏>:Waaahhhh! Don't listen! Don't say it!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe... +I turned off the lights and closed the door to the storeroom while Viking was inside getting something... +Then Viking started crying and banging on the door and said she was soooo scared! She was crying so loudly!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;P7(0)||:I... I didn't! P7's just making things up!
MP446(0);C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Huh? So you're scared of the dark, Viking? Are you a scaredy-cat?
MP446(0);M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Viking, you're sooooo lame! +What's so scary about a dark storeroom? It's exciting, isn't it?
MP446(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:See, see? And you were talking about how you would be okay with any kind of mission just now~ +You can't do anything by yourself, how can someone like that take on a night op?!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Humph...humph! +I did that on purpose for you to see, P7... +How could anyone go on a mission if they were afraid of the dark?
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Eh...so it was fake... +But...
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;C96(0)||:That's right, it was fake, so don't ask about it!
MP446(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehehe... I got it. +If you were really faking just now, why not prove it? 
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;P7(0)||:How...how do I do that?
MP446(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I know a place where we can test your courage. We'll go tonight, how about that? +You won't refuse if you're really not scared, right?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Um...er...
MP446(0);C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Viking, you're not bluffing us, are you? Liars are worse than scaredy-cats.
MP446(0);M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It's not like you need to lie about being scared of the dark... +You should just say yes since it's fun, Viking.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) F-fine, I'll go! What's there to be afraid of?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hehehe...it's a deal, then. +We'll meet here tonight then sneak out of the base together. You'd better come.

C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:It's kind of cold... P7, are we there yet?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:We've arrived. +Just in time to see what's inside!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Where...is this place...?
()||<BIN>55</BIN><Night>:...There is a thick, tightly-closed trapdoor in the underground tunnel beneath the town. The door is not labelled.
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:This door looks pretty cool! It feels like there's something fun behind it.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I found it when everyone was searching this area earlier. +However, I never had the time to open it and go in. Now we're just in time for Viking to show her stuff!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Eh...me?!
MP446(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Yup. Just go in there, walk around a little, then come out and tell us what's inside. +That should be simple if you're not afraid of the dark, right?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>;P7(0)||:I...but...that...
MP446(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Is it me, or is Viking shivering? She looks soooo scared!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:I'm not! +It...it's just going inside! I'm not scared!
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:Hahahaha! That's more like it! +Come out quick, I want to know what's inside!
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:Humph! Just you wait!

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:The door's open, MP-446. We'll be waiting here for your return~ +You won't come running back halfway while crying, will you?
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||:As if that would happen...! +If you don't believe me...then go ahead and close the door!
C96(0)<Speaker>C96</Speaker>||:Ohhhh! You're so cool, Viking! Frankly speaking, even I wouldn't dare to try that...
M1919A4(0)<Speaker>M1919A4</Speaker>||:It'll be pitch black if you close the door... +Wow, just thinking about it gets me excited, I want to go in there too!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:While I didn't intend to do this at first... +Since you've said so, let's close the door. Remember, you need to go all the way in. +Good luck!

MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><Night>:Please let this be the last room... +Huh? This is... + Aaaaaahhh!
()||:...The sprawling underground chamber is filled with many Dummy bodies. +It would seem she has arrived at a large warehouse.
MP446(0)<Speaker>MP-446</Speaker>||<BIN>88</BIN><Night>:What the heck, it scared me to death. Turns out it's just a bunch of Doll Dummies... +But there's so many here...it feels kind of creepy. +Still, that's not enough to frighten me! There's nothing scary about a bunch of non-moving bodies!
()||:MP-446 approaches one of the Dummies.
