M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:This is a personal security mission assigned to us. +We're to send a squad member to protect the Boss.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:And the Commander's bodyguard has to be...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm leaving the Boss to M1911. +The rest of you are on clean-up duty with me.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Okay. I'll escort my Darling to our destination without losing a single hair.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:What?! +Why are you sending HER, Miss Thompson?
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Because I'm the best candidate for protecting my Darling, of course!
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:How is that possible? +An old granny like you is obsolete! Only a rising star like me can protect the Commander!
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Please send me instead, Miss Thompson! +I will escort the Commander to the destination without losing a single cell!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I'm gonna get angry for real if you call me old granny again, M9. +Compared to a little kid still wet behind her ears, a mature woman can better cater to all of the Commander's needs.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Humph. So what if your boobs were stuffed with more fillings during manufacture?! +It's not like I don't have boobs myself!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Enough. We're going ahead with the original plan. +If you two wanna settle the score, have some fun on the training ground. Just don't go overboard.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Humph... Then I'll see you there, Old Granny!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏1>:Alright. I accept your challenge for the sake of my Darling.
()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Two hours later, on the training ground.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Bang! Game over, M9.
M1911(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:D-dammit! +Resorting to dirty tricks like throwing sand in my eyes... Come have a shoot-out with me if you dare!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(1)||<BIN>73</BIN>:Enemies on the field won't just stand there and have a square fight with you. +You must always keep a clear head and make the right calls...
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(1)||<BIN>73</BIN>:You still have much to learn, sweetheart.
M1911(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Eww, don't call me that! +Fine. You won this round...but I'll beat you next time!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(1)||<BIN>73</BIN>:...Being piqued won't make you improve, M9. +If you want, I can help you analyze your combat data.
M1911(0);M9(1)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I'll do it myself! I don't need to be patronized by an old granny! +Don't let it get to your head either... +You may be standing next to the Commander this time, but I'll definitely snatch the position back!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(1)||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏1> :Yeah, yeah, I know. +You should also remember...that I won't lose to you in terms of my love for my Darling.
()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏2>:M9 turns and stalks off angrily.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Looks like your problem hasn't really been solved, 1911.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:But it should subside for the time being. +Sigh...it's pretty tiring locking horns with little kids...
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Indeed. Things would be much easier if everyone can settle differences reasonably.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:Still, M9 is pretty strong. +I made it look easy, but to be honest, it was a close fight...
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Then you'd better work harder, 1911. +Or you'll really end up being looked down on by the young ones.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I know, Thompson. +I really should start thinking about my future.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏1>:If I don't make any progress, I'll be left behind by my Darling.
