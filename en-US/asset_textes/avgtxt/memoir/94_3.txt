M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM><黑屏2>:Our mission this time round is to establish a supply route. +We might encounter a lot of S.F. forces along the way, so it's a pretty difficult mission. +The Commander's already allocated the members of the main force, but we need a lookout... Any volunteers?
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:So I'll only be standing sentry...not interested.
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Don't you need to run a long way to build a supply line?+Why not just randomly assign someone, Class Rep?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Well, the people taking part in this operation will receive the privilege of preparing certain dishes.+Thanks to a certain disturbance which arose last time, I'm coming before you now to get your opinions.
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><震屏>:What, making dishes? I'll go!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Let me do it let me do it!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Get lost, you only know how to slurp sugar, send me instead!
格里芬人形()<Speaker>Griffin Doll</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:What? You think you of the salt faction are magnificent? See if you can step out of HQ alive if you're so great!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Wait...hold it, you lot!+D-don't crowd around all of a sudden! I can't see anything!+At attention, all of you! Stand in place!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Class Rep! Pick me, pick me!
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Class Rep, please let me go.
64type(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Eh? You're applying to go too, 64?+Building a supply line is pretty tough, you know.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;M99(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I understand, Class Rep. I am prepared for it...+This mission, I must insist that it be assigned to me.
64type(0);97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Huhhhh? As if a fragile princess like you could handle an op like that. +Class Rep, you'll rest more easily if you send me.
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;97typeS(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I am not a fragile princess. At least, not anymore.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Are you challenging me?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hold it, you two... You're friends, you shouldn't be at each other's throats...+If you can't settle it with an argument, then we'll settle it the usual way...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Bring it on, then! You think I'm scared?
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>;97typeS(0)||<黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:I won't lose... Not this time!
()||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:... +An hour later, the exercise is in its final stages...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN>:It's so quiet... Everyone else was eliminated already...+64's the only one left. I didn't think she'd actually survive until the end.+Still, it doesn't matter. There's still a chance to turn the tables.+I just saw her hide behind that piece of cover on the other side. All I need to do is go over and finish her off. This time...
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1><BIN>1</BIN>:I win, Miss Hawk.
97霰()<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN>:64?! When did you...

M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><黑屏2>:Alright, the exercise is over.+According to the results, Type 64 has earned the right to take part in this operation.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:How did...+I didn't hear a thing and...
64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I've always been very quiet, Hawk... Have you forgotten?+After losing to you the last time round, I decided to focus on training up that aspect of myself.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:"A scholar's absence of three days thereafter must be viewed under new light". You'll need to work hard too, Hawk.
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type 97S</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Ah, I lost to you this time, 64. +But it won't be so easy next time!
97typeS(0);64type(0)<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏1>:Mm, I know that. Therefore, I'll keep pushing myself.+Actually, it's thanks to everyone that I managed to improve.+So I'd like to to make everyone a cup of tea before the mission begins.
64式()<Speaker>Type 64</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I can still recall the taste that cup of tea left on the tip of my tongue for a long time afterwards.+It was the most delicious tea I'd ever had. It tasted...like victory.
