()||<BIN>73</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...At the shooting range in the Griffin base.
()||<BIN>73</BIN><SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:The sound of gunfire echoes through the range, and scalding-hot brass litters the ground.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Hit, hit, hit...
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Hey, you're the only one still practicing. Shouldn't you call it a day?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:It's not enough.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:There's too many areas I need to improve in. If we encounter a situation like that again...
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:About that...
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:You're not suited to this kind of practice, are you? You're not an assault rifle or a submachine gun.
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:SVD looks at the paper targets that SV-98 has been shooting at. They're moving rapidly from side to side, and new targets appear at random.
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:...It's obvious that a bolt-action rifle can't keep up with this pace.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:I'm not good at close combat or rapid fire, but if I don't work hard to overcome it, I'll be putting the others in danger.
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Is this a problem you can overcome with just hard work? Every Doll has their own strengths and weaknesses.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:You're one of the elite, SVD, so I doubt you'd understand.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>;SVD(0)||<BIN>73</BIN>:But for me, I'd be nothing but trash if I couldn't even put in this much effort!
SV98(0);SVD(0)<Speaker>SVD</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:...Humph, well, if that's what you think, then I should just leave you to it.
()||<BIN>73</BIN><SE1>Reload</SE1>:SV-98 looks at SVD as she leaves, then sighs before pulling out a fresh magazine to reload.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I should have thanked her.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:But if I don't get stronger, how can I face everyone...
SV98(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Isn't it pretty late already? Who's still practicing here?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Commander!
SV98(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I look at the ground, which is strewn with shell casings. There are at least several hundred of them here, and they look like they're all from rounds of the same caliber.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Did you fire off all these rounds by yourself? Don't tell me you like plinking.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Um, I did submit a request to Miss Kalina! Please deduct the cost of the rounds I've used beyond my allowance from my salary...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Don't be silly. Wanting to train yourself is a good thing, and I definitely support that.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Still, shouldn't there be a limit to it?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Or...are you still bothered by what happened on your last mission?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Commander, it's precisely because of the mistake I made in the previous mission that I have to become stronger.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Or rather, I have to become stronger, no matter what...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Do you really want to become stronger so badly?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Can't I...?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:SV-98, do you know why humanity created Autonomous Dolls in the first place?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Uh... It's because the population and workforce declined sharply after the Collapse and WWIII...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:That's a textbook answer.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:But if that were all, then ordinary robots would have sufficed as labor. You wouldn't need Autonomous Dolls for that.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:...I don't understand then, Commander.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:In that case, why were we created?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I guess, and this is just a guess...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Since humanity is imperfect, we want friends who are...less than perfect.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Huh? But why?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:If you were machines that carried out all orders you were given, then what difference would there be between you and washing machines or microwave ovens or military automatons?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:You mean...we can't become military automatons?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Why should you?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I thought they were a benchmark for us...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:They have nothing to do with you.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:You've found a place for yourselves, and that is here, in Griffin.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:We are your benchmarks, and we can make mistakes at any time.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:So are you saying...we were deliberately made to be imperfect? Were we flawed from the beginning?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:What is "perfection", anyway?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:"Quirks" and "special features" are hardly "imperfections", don't you think?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Special features...
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:So my mistake...is a special feature?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:At the very least, you need to put your problem into perspective. You can't take it lightly, but you can't obsess over it either.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:There's no point fearing or avoiding it. You need to believe that someday, you'll overcome it.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I...I understand, Commander...
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:But...but as I am now, I just don't know what I should do...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:While you're confused, the fact is that you've already found the answer, haven't you?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Hm?
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:At the very least, you've managed to grasp your own weaknesses and limitations during this time.
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:That's the first step to becoming stronger.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:I...I think so. I know what my limitations are.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:But...
SV98(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Actually, I.O.P. just contacted us recently.
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Huh?
SV98(0)<Speaker>SV-98</Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:Do you mean-
SV98(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN>:As SV-98 listens to me, her eyes widen.
SV98(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><黑屏1>:They start glinting brightly with excitement.
