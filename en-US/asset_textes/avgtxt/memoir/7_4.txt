()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><Night><黑屏2><SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:One of Hunter's bullets pierces through OTs-12's left arm. She stumbles, and Hunter already has the barrel of her gun planted right against OTs-12's temple.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I did not expect a trash-tier model like you to last this long. +But surely you must have reached your limit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OTs-12 fumbles weakly behind her with her arm.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The small grenade is shot out of her hand before she can even activate it. The explosion sends OTs-12 flying.
OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:<color=#A9A9A9>Back then...what did Stechkin do?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I really should've installed the self-destruct protocol that she mentioned this afternoon...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:Some kind of background noise is carried along by the wind, but OTs-12 can no longer be sure if it is caused by the signal interference in her own program or something else.
OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I suppose I really am at my limit...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Footsteps. +Why can I hear footsteps? +Is it my imagination? Or...have Sangvis reinforcements arrived...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><Night><黑屏2><震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:An explosion goes off not far away. +Hunter's face darkens as she turns toward the sound.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:More footsteps. +It sounds like someone is walking over broken tiles and smashed timber. +OTs-12 musters the strength to raise her head...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<size=48>Tiss, you absolute idiot! Moron! You can blow up your neural cloud all you want! I...I hate you!</size>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:OTs-12 is so taken aback she stops hearing the wind altogether. +Hunter frowns and studies the confident-looking Doll standing in front of her.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:The prey that slipped away just now? I didn't expect you to return.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Hunter, how about a deal?
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:What have you done?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:I blew up the storage unit with the holographic camouflage. I also planted some explosives in your other supply stash.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:So?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin waves to show the detonator in her hand.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:If you're okay with losing all your precious supplies, then go ahead and put a hole through her little head. +Or...you can let her go AND pick up your leftover Sangvis parts.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:And why would I make such a deal with you?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:You're not stupid, surely you understand. +Our reinforcements will arrive any minute. You kill us, Griffin will wipe you out and spare no one. Is that worth it? +But if you release us, nobody will come and give you any more trouble. +We are negotiating on equal footing here, that should be quite obvious to you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The wind blows on as Hunter scrutinizes Stechkin with her topaz eyes. +A brief moment later, she moves her barrel away from OTs-12's head.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Throw away your detonator and scram. +I won't let you off the hook next time, prey.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>3</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Late into the night. +On the way back to the Griffin base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Stechkin helps support OTs-12's weight as they walk wordlessly back to the base. +OTs-12 finds herself studying Stechkin's profile, but Stechkin's expression is obscured by the dark.
OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Stechkin...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin continues to stare straight ahead, but she slows down her pace considerably.
OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:How did you know Hunter would let me go? +I mean... If she'd killed us both and withdrew immediately, Griffin's reinforcements wouldn't get to her in time, would they? +No, wait. Why...why did you come back anyway? You even set so many explosives...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:What's going on? You don't usually talk so much. Have you been saving it all up for now?
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:I didn't know if Hunter would actually let you go. There were never any “Griffin reinforcements”. I didn't plant any explosives either. It was just a bluff.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Huh?! But wouldn't she realize you tricked her once she checked the area?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Hunter has always been very cautious, even though that was only her Dummy. +I'm guessing they'll probably waste no time in switching locations. +After all...I did actually blow up the storage unit. Sure, I did not plant any more explosives, but she has no way of verifying the existence of Griffin's reinforcements.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:S-so it was all a big gamble?! +If she hadn't bought it, she'd have captured you as well!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Not likely. +I said I didn't plant any explosives, but I never said the explosives didn't exist.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:What?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:I don't have too many. I gave you some, and the rest...
APS(0);OTs12(1)||:
()||:Stechkin lifts up one side of her coat.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:The rest are just enough for this.
APS(0);OTs12(1)||:
()||:OTs-12 catches a glimpse of what lies beneath Stechkin's coat and lets out a horrified yelp.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker><Shake>||:You...! +Oh no, the detonator! Hunter made you leave it behind!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Relax, I deactivated it. It won't trigger any explosions. +So you don't have to worry about me getting blown high sky all of a sudden..
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Now that Stechkin is done explaining the situation, the duo lapse into silence again. +After a long while, OTs-12 suddenly bursts out laughing.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What? Is your voice control malfunctioning?
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Stechkin... So THAT was your signal... +For your “self-destruct protocol”...?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:What are you talking about? I told you it would be something I obviously didn't mean, didn't I?
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:You did! Back then, you said...you hated me!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Hey, I actually meant that. It's not like I'm never honest.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Heheh, really? +They why did you risk the entire mission just to save me?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Because they put that stupid “place Griffin's survival above all else” protocol inside my neural cloud. +I simply can't leave a Griffin Doll for dead and run away myself.
APS(0);OTs12(1)||:
()||:Stechkin pauses briefly.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:I didn't do it for you. Now we really don't owe each other anything.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Oh? you think so?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Of course. You're dumb, you've got bad comprehension skills, and you never talk about your troubles. You lie about having a “secret weapon” and you only know how to do as you're told in battle. +No wait, you didn't do that this time.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Heheh... From now on, I really have a “secret weapon”.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:Hm? What would that be? Anyway, you're a massive pain in the ass. I hate you, Tiss.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:I know, I know. I love you too.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:What are you talking about...? I said I hate you, Tiss.
APS(0);OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||:Yep, I love you too!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>;OTs12(1)||:...I really, really hate you, Tiss.
OTs12(1)<Speaker>OTs-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, alright, I really, really love you too, Stechkin.♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The next day. Griffin base. +In the command room.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Stechkin stares at the document lying on the desk, completely exasperated.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Commander, I don't get it.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm? Is there a problem?
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Multiple problems. I don't even know where to start... +Okay, first of all, you know I've ruined my own service record. I also failed to complete the mission of recovering the supplies. So why do I get a neural upgrade?
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Oh... Well...because you're an important asset to Griffin.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What kind of explanation is that...? +Whatever. Moving on... Why did you install the neural upgrade while I was asleep without asking me first?!
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hm... Uh...because it's just easier...
APSMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin glares at the Commander helplessly.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You're always so freaking presumptuous! You and Tiss, both of you...
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Speaking of OTs-12, her arm has been fully repaired. You can check on her anytime. +Thanks to your intel, we've dispatched troops to clean up those Sangvis remnants. +As for the botched mission... I believe you've more than made up for it. +Oh, by the way, OTs-12 is footing the bill for your neural upgrade. 
APSMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin freezes for a second before she grins.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Fine. At least I can now get rid of that damn protocol and make money my top priority again.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can't pass the safety test like that.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry about that. +Thanks to you, I am now bound to Tiss because of my debt. This kind of financial obligation is much more binding than any coercive programming.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:For some reason, hearing you say that makes me feel kind of sorry for myself... +Stechkin, you ARE loyal to Griffin, right?! Right?!
APSMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Stechkin chuckles, her eyes as mischievous as OTs-12's.
APSMod(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Of course. Just keep your eyes peeled and I will prove myself, my dear Commander.
