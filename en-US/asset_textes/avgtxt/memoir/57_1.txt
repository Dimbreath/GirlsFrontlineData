()||<BIN>82</BIN><Night>:In the Griffin dormitory.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<Night><BIN>82</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Tomorrow will be our first official mission. +I can't allow any mistakes on our first outing, so I'd better turn in early tonight.
()||<Night><BIN>82</BIN><Night>:An hour later.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><Night>:Dammit... I can't sleep after all... +I'm only going to waste time lying here; I'd better go over the mission briefing again.
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<Night><BIN>82</BIN>:M16 is sleeping well. A minor mission like this ought to be a piece of cake for someone as experienced as her. +SOP-II's fast asleep. I guess having an empty head like hers is an advantage at a time like this... +M4 should also be...
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<Night><BIN>82</BIN>:Huh? She's not in bed?
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<Night><BIN>82</BIN><黑点1>:The door is slightly ajar... Where has she gone?
AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:So that's where you are.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Eh!? +Oh, it's you, AR-15... +Weren't you asleep?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:...I woke up to get some air. +What about you, why aren't you in bed?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I couldn't fall asleep... +I felt restless while lying on my bed, so I thought I might as well do some planning. +That way, at least we'll have a response ready if we encounter any contingencies tomorrow...
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Do you really need to do so much planning for a simple recon mission? +We might not even get a chance to trade fire with the enemy.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm the team leader, so it's only natural for me to plan about these things... +Also, since this is our first mission together, I want to complete it flawlessly.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:If that's what you're really thinking, then I can be somewhat at ease.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:What do you mean by "at ease"?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I was actually kind of worried about whether or not we could successfully complete this mission. +After all, it was a miracle that we made it through our trials with a rookie like you giving orders.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:(Sighs) Is that so... The weight on my shoulders feels even heavier now. +Oh yes, that also means...you can't sleep because of tomorrow's mission as well, right?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:......+ ...I guess you could say that. +I mean, how could I sleep peacefully when my team leader's on the verge of a mental breakdown over a recon mission?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Haha...that means you're just like us, AR-15.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm not exactly happy to hear you say that.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I'm sorry...I wasn't referring to our abilities. +You're serious and capable, and you're very strict with yourself... +In truth, I was kind of afraid of you at first.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:So you're not scared of me anymore?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Ah...well, not as much... +At least I now know that you get nervous about upcoming missions, just like me. +And that you can be so worried that you can't sleep...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:How shall I say this... It feels like...we're actually quite similar.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Similar, huh...
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I admit, I do have my weaknesses. +But we're warriors. We're weapons... +There's only one thing we need to focus on, which is to devote every part of ourselves to achieving victory. +Uneasiness and uncertainty are weaknesses that should be discarded...
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Especially in your case, M4A1... You're our leader, so it's even more important that you remain level-headed at all times.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...I've often felt that you might be better suited to be team leader than me, AR-15.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:But the humans chose you. Those are the orders. +Since you're the team leader, you ought to take responsibility for it. +All you need to do is focus on leadership and bring victory for us...for the members of the team.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Thank you, AR-15. +I won't disappoint you tomorrow.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I believe you. I'm sure you wouldn't want to know what'll happen if you disappoint me.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...I'll keep that in mind. +Also...it's really late now. Want to go back together and turn in?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:You're done with the contingency planning?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Yes, I'm more than well prepared. +...We'll test the results of our training against the mission tomorrow.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Alright.
M4A1(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:AR-15 leaves.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Goodnight, AR-15. +...I'll be counting on you tomorrow.
()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.7</黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:... +That's...only to be expected.
