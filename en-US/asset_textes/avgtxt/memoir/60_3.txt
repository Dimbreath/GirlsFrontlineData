9A91(0)<Speaker>9A-91</Speaker>||:I've got to hand it to you, AS Val, you're very good at tracking moving targets.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:If I don't put in practice time, I won't be able to keep my skills sharp... And if that happens, I'll end up holding everyone back. 
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Aw, nobody minds that. Want to have lunch together later?

()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Oh, you've made great progress, although there's still room for improvement.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:It's you...Commander.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It feels like I haven't had a one-on-one chat with you for a long time, AS Val. +You've changed a lot recently.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:...I want to become more reliable, so I put in a lot of effort.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:While knowing your weaknesses and correcting them is a good thing, I feel that there's no need to force yourself to do something you're not suited for. +Just as a naturally quiet person shouldn't force themselves to speak up if they don't want to.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:That... +You even managed to pick up on something like that?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Kalina went through the combat records for all the Dolls and wrote reports on them, you know. +Reading through all those reports took a long time, but thanks to her thorough work, I can tell if there's a problem, even if I didn't witness it with my own eyes. +For instance, the incident when you, AK-74U and 9A-91 evacuated on the chopper.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:I see... +Well, it happened on the battlefield, there's basically no privacy on the frontlines. 
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You saved valuable company property and participated actively during combat. That deserves a reward.+To humans, "going above and beyond the call of duty" is something that's worthy of a medal. +But for Dolls, I think you'd prefer something more practical?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:So I'm going to be commended for it? ...I'd rather it had never happened at all. +If it wasn't because of...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Are you still going to give Misha the credit?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker><Shake>||:I...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:At this point, AS Val freezes, and while there's a forced smile on her face, the tears keep streaming down her cheeks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I'm sorry. I misspoke. 
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Nyet, it's alright. You do have a point. +I suppose I said that because...I'm still immature.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AS Val takes out a misshapen lump of tattered fabric from her coat pocket and shows it to me.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Misha was by my side even before I came to Griffin. +At least, until I made friends... +Nobody can replace AK-74U and 9A-91 as my precious friends, but...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They still aren't enough?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Even with real friends...there were still a lot of things I couldn't bring myself to tell them, things which I could only tell Misha. +I know that at the time, I was afraid of facing reality and needed an excuse to vent my emotions so I could relax... +But after what happened, I wanted to leave that side of me behind and become a Doll who could interact normally with others. +But I still want to fix Misha, because this was my first friend... +So when I actually did it, I discovered that I was terrible at needlework... I guess I'm a disappointment of a Doll.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Commander, I have a request. Would you be willing to hear me out?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Go ahead.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:Can you edit my neural cloud and delete everything about Misha? +I want to let go of the past...because I can only become a Doll who isn't a burden to others by growing up. +I simply need to eliminate the part of me that refuses to do that.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm not an expert in the field of neural cloud engineering... +But just altering your personal memories will cause a lot of conflicts with the memories of other Dolls. +If you edit a neural cloud too much and there are too many conflicts with saved memories, it might lead to your neural cloud breaking down.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:But if we do it like AK-74U...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's a different case. You are you.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:...Does this mean I'll have to live with this weak neural cloud forever, Commander? +At this rate...I don't know what I'm going to do... +What should I do?
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:There are many things which cannot simply be judged right or wrong. When you have to make a choice, you just need to do what you think is right.+Besides, the idea of "throwing everything away and starting anew" is just a thinly disguised desire to run away from the choices you made... +And the fact is, all the choices we've made in the past built on each other to give you your present, so completely abandoning your past is unrealistic.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...That's true. After all, we can't always have everything go our way. +Though it'll be troublesome and painful... I will try to find an answer on my own. +I'm sure Misha would be happy with that too. +Spasibo, Commander.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I originally came here to treat you to a meal, but I ended up touching a sore spot by accident. +There's no way I could just walk away all pleased with myself at this point.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||:If you want to treat us to a meal, I'll find a high-class restaurant I've never been to before and bring AK-74U and 9A-91 along.
ASVAL(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1>:That will be taken care of, no need to worry. +Oh yes, I have a question that might seem a little odd...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:If Misha had a gender, do you think it would be male or female?
()<Speaker>AS Val</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh?
