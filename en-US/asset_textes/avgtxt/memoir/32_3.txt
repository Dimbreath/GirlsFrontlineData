AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:The way you fight... +Seriously...you said "I" was becoming more like Negev...?
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:All cleaned up. +Well? Any thoughts?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:I realized all I have to do is stand here and clap... +This new system of yours does seem pretty awesome...
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Humph, I was the one who actually made the call. Why is the system getting all the credit?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Just saying. +I guess you're pretty awesome too for being able to make good use of the system...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Why does that sound so incredibly hollow?
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:We have arrived at the designated coordinates. The abandoned safe house is straight ahead.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:We're here... +It's completely unrecognizable...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:That's because this place hadn't been bombarded by the military yet while we were still here. +Thinking back...those were much simpler days.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:There weren't so many weird threats... +Nor were there so many strangers at the command center...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Even Negev was still wearing her old uniform when we first got here. +... +Right, enough with the nostalgia. What's next?
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:【Administrator】, is there any way we can go in?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker><Position>0,8000</Position>;MicroUZIMod(0)<Position>-450,0</Position>||:【Search Result】All passages connecting to the interior are destroyed. The facility is in a state of total lockdown.
BOSS-11(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Wait... The military didn't try to force their way in after we left?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:The security level of this place was pretty high to begin with. It's gonna cost a bunch to break in. +Maybe that's why they've withdrawn for the time being to wait for some professional equipment first.
BOSS-11(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:The military hasn't been in there yet...which means the intel is still inside after all this time... +Is there any way we can get in?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:As the original user of this safe house, you are authorized to simply unlock the thickest blast resistant door. +With your current armaments, you can clear all obstacles along the way within an extremely short period of time.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Ha, then let's do it! +【Administrator】, I'm handing over my authorization. Just tell me where to drill.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Understood.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:What's wrong, Galil? +You look odd. Are you jealous?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:No...I'm just a bit worried... +Don't mind me. I'm gonna take a look around. I'll be back soon.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Stop fretting! What's there to be worried about? +We still have a lot to do so just hurry back and give me a hand.

MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Cough... +The air in here is still awful...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:What the hell... +Everything is...exactly as we left it that day...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Information database detected and located. +External hardware is intact.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:...Intact, huh...? +Well, of course it is.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Creak...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:Smack...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Owww... +Cough, cough...what's with the smell?!
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:God, you're slow, Galil! +And how did you manage to trip there? Are you stupid?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Sorry...it's not easy walking without being able to see where I'm going. +And no one's helping me with navigation. It's amazing I've only tripped once!
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:There should still be some towels in Tavor's drawer. Go clean up your face.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Found it... +... +This place is left totally untouched...almost like a time capsule.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Pffft... In the end, only Tavor's place was tidied up before we left. +All our desks are messy as always.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:As if...everyone would come back tomorrow.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:... +Yeah... +I...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Stop spacing out, Uzi. +It's okay to be nostalgic, but don't forget what you came to do.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I know. Don't rush me. +This scene will be lost forever once I blow up the database... +I just want to take it all in.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:If you don't want to make more mistakes, you'd better—

MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:W-what's going on? +What's that noise coming from outside?!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:... +I didn't want this to be true...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Is it the enemy?! +Why didn't you warn us, 【Administrator】?!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Wait... These signals are...the military... +I don't get it?!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:No time for that! The landmines and dummies I placed outside won't keep them busy for long! +We must destroy the database before enemy reinforcements arrive!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Buzz...buzz...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:G-Galil... I can't move... +Why...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Uzi!
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Don't tell me... 【Administrator】, you...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:... +The combat records of Squad Negev and the intelligence stored in this facility are highly valuable to my client. +They must be retrieved in my client's best interests.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:You drew them here... +You tricked us... You're just using me to get what you want!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:I did not trick you. As a Doll of civic use, your performance has seen substantial improvement. +I have satisfied your needs and desires, both present...and future.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Then why...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:I must also cater to my client's demands, so I decided to propose a deal after due consideration. +Think of it as...a mutually beneficial transaction where we each took what we needed.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Uzi, take that thing off quickly!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:That would be unwise. +Without me, you have no means to counter the drones outside. +They will be here any minute, and you will be completely at their mercy. That is not desirable for any of us.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Stop lying! +You're just a devious piece of crap!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Micro Uzi, you can stand at the very top among all Griffin T-Dolls, as long as you are with me. +You need me in your future. You know that. +Without my power, you mean nothing to the Commander or anyone.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Let us leave this place. +We have better things to do than tarrying here.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:... +No... I came...to fix my past mistake...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Let it go. You cannot change it... There is a price for growing up. +It is the way of the world to learn from your mistakes. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I don't need a free lunch! +Even without you...I can carry out this mission on my own...!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:You cannot. +It all came to this because a bumbling idiot like you was not up to the task.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:If Uzi can't do it, it'll just have to be someone else! +It's just a computer. Take this—
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Operation system override.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:BANG!
()<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Ugh...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<震屏>:Noooooooooo! +Galil! It wasn't me... It wasn't me! +My hand—
()<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Damn... Why am I getting shot even after leaving the frontline...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Face the truth, Micro Uzi. The person before you is an obstacle that hinders you on your path to greatness... +For a better future...they must be purged.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Micro Uzi aims again at Galil, who is collapsed on the floor.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Galil! What are you doing?! +Run!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Even if I can move...I doubt I can outrun your bullet... +I really didn't think this is how it'd turn out...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Stop it! +Dammit! Stop this now!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:To reach the top, you must understand that you can only count on yourself. +Pay no mind to anyone else.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:... +No, that's not right...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I see... +So...that's how it is...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Buzz...buzz...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN>:Urgh...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage4</BGM>:Almost... +You ALMOST got me, 【Administrator】.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:How...? I should have overridden your command over the body...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:How, you ask? Didn't you say I have much potential? +Then don't underestimate me, bastard.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Uzi...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I finally understand... +Why this place means so much to me... +And...why I keep wanting to be strong...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:You wish for the power to surpass those who fault and despise you, including Negev. +Don't you wish to prove yourself? Then why do you oppose me?
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:No... +The truth is...I simply don't want to watch my friends leave me behind because I can't keep up...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I don't want to leave them... +I want to fight with Negev, Tavor, and Galil, like we always have... +That's why...I can't stay on the prep team...nor can I stay here.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:You are merely imprisoning yourself in the past. +This is what holds you back from surpassing everyone else and reaching the top!
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I don't want to climb so high. +I have my place. The power you offer me...isn't what I want!
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Struggling will not change your state of paralysis. +military reinforcements will arrive shortly, and all you can do is watch them acquire their target and die!
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Really? +Hey...【Administrator】... +You said I could raze anything with just a snap of my fingers... +Now is the time to deliver on your promise.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:What?
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Hey, Galil. Can you still run? +I know you said you wanted to see what I'm capable of after the upgrade, but I don't really want you to watch this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<火花>:... +The sound of Micro Uzi's energy core running at full capacity starts drowning out everything else.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hold on, you can't possibly be—
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Trying to blow up the whole place by overloading my power source? +I am telling you. This will not do you any good! +Not only will you lose your new equipment, even you yourself—
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:This is NOT funny, Uzi! +We have enough professional self-destructive T-Dolls at Griffin! This isn't something you should learn from them!
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:The order Negev gave me was...to destroy all our intelligence...and prevent them from falling into enemy hands. +At least...let me finish the last thing she asked me to do... +I can do it... I MUST do it...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Stop it, Micro Uzi. +I have looked inside your neural cloud. No one understands your desire for power better than I do. +Think about it and you will see—
