M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:...So that's your story. +Earlier models really had it rough.
M21(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:But we were really happy! +Thank you so much for listening to our story, M21.
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:It's nothing. We're friends, after all. +I'm glad to know you better.
M21(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Hmm, we've finished our coffee. +Time to rejoin the squad...
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:You seem nervous?
M21(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Yeah... +It's been a while, and we look different now... We wonder how they'll see us.
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Don't worry. M14 is M14. +Besides, you did us a huge favor on our last mission. Miss Thompson was all smiles. +She arranged special training for you and even asked the Commander to file you in for a Neural Upgrade. +M1911 never had anything against you. Even M9, fussy as she is, won't have a problem with you.
M21(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Really?
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Really! I'm not joking this time.
M21(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Th-that's a relief!
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now let's go. They're in for a shock when they see how you've turned out.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>82</BIN>:In the dorm at the Griffin base.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Say...isn't it the last day of the special training that Thompson put M14 through?
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:I think so... It's been more than a month. I wonder what M14's like after all that training. +I sure hope she didn't turn into a Thompson 2.0!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M9(0)||:If Thompson were here, you'd probably be full of holes by now.
M1911(0);M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Humph... +(Mutters) If Thompson ever finds out, some old granny must've snitched on me.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:I heard that, M9.
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:So you're here!
()||:The two T-Dolls in the lounge turn simultaneously to the door.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Ah, you're back, M14.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:What...? Are you really M14?
M21(0)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:The one and only!
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:It's been a while. We missed you!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:You look a lot cooler than before. +Damn, can't believe I'm actually jealous...
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Heheh, all thanks to Thompson's special training! +Oh, and Miss Kalin, who acquired a lot of new parts for us. +We can easily take on hundreds of Sangvis now!
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:Haha, it's the same old M14, alright. +Now you don't have to worry, M9.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:...I wasn't worried or anything!
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Don't worry. We'll definitely be of help from now on!
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:I said I wasn't worried...whatever.
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>||:By the way... M14, that's not the first thing you should say when you see us.
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Huh? Then what should we say?
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>||:Yep, she's still an idiot... +Isn't it obvious that you should say something along the lines of "I'm back" when you get home?
M14Mod(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh... Then...we're back! +From now on, we will fight side by side with you!
