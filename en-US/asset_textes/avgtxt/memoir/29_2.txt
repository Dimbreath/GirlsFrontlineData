MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:Don't give me any of that! +I just saw a human while I was running some recon. I'm tailing him at the moment... +We can't just leave him on his own in this dangerous city.
MK2(0);AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What? How do you know you aren't following some kind of Sangvis bait?</color>
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>;AAT52(0)||:I'm not. I've verified the data and his identity!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Transmission terminated.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Huh?? But wait! You can't just...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The line is already dead.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright... STEN, don't be afraid, you can do this... +Humans are all kind like the Commander. Just explain the situation, I'm sure he'll help... It'll all be fine!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏2><Night><BIN>85</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Is-is anybody there?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Can you hear me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Stay away from me!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:But... Hold on, I'm not from Sangvis Ferri! +I work for the PMC Griffin & Kryuger. My name is STEN MkII.
()<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Griffin...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A man pokes his head out from behind the door and gives STEN a once-over.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:I'm not going to hurt you.
()<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:You're armed... Wait a minute... +Have we met...?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Huh?
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:There was a traffic accident on the highway a few weeks ago... A girl with a red beret jumped in front of my car and stopped me... +That was you, wasn't it? You're the girl?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Huh...? Don't tell me...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:STEN accesses her neural cloud records.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Huh?? That-that's right! +So...you're the man who helped me back then... +I didn't record too many details... I...
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:So you're a Griffin android, huh. Goddammit, if I'd known, I wouldn't have... +Still...what are you doing here?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:We've come to retrieve a document. I must also escort you to safety.
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Document? What document?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Document 36. It contains information that's very important to us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Document 36...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:That's right. Um...are you aware of its whereabouts?
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:No, never heard of it. +Look for it somewhere else.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Huh? +... +But my teammate just told me...
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Are you questioning me, Doll?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:N-not at all... But AAT-52 did say the document was most probably...
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Wherever it is, it's got nothing to do with me!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:My scanner indicates that your heartbeat is accelerating... +Mr. Human, could you...be lying?
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:I told you already, I don't know anything! +You'd better head back to your warehouse already!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, are you trying to hide the fact that you know the location of Document 36...? +But...why?
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Is something wrong with your head – I mean, neural cloud?! Don't you understand what I'm saying?!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:B-but...
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Alright... I hear that unlike the Sangvis Dolls out there, you Griffin Dolls still obey commands given by humans?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:That is correct... But—
MK2(0)<Speaker>Male Human</Speaker>||:Then I now refuse to answer any of your questions, and I forbid you to pester me about it any further!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:No, please...! +We really need to retrieve that document... It's all we need...
Male Human()||:Screw off!
()||:...Bang! +...The man locks himself inside the office and gives no further response.
()||:...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You helped me before... +So why...?
