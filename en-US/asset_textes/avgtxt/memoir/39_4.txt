SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||<震屏>:Hey! I heard Mosin-Nagant's back! +Is it true?!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Yes, it is! She's back! +Or rather...she doesn't need to go all the way to HQ to work anymore.
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:That doesn't matter! +So where's Mosin-Nagant?! Where did she go?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Er...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Pffft...
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Hang on, what's with those looks on your faces? +Just so you know, if you're messing with me...
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:SVT-38... I'm right here.
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:... +Eh? Ehhhhhhhhh?!
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:The remodel was completed without a hitch, and some stuff has been changed...like...my outfit and so on...
M1903Cafe(0)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hehe, if not for the bloodline she carries, we'd really have treated Mosin-Nagant like a new Doll when she walked in today.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You're not the only one with that look on your face today, SVT-38.
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Urgh... +Alright, I know why now. But Mosin-Nagant, where did that cat on your lap come from?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Oh, that's the cat who barged in halfway through the Commander's briefing!  +When I came back, I found that someone had sent it to the rescue station, so now it's a new member of our dorm!
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:Wasn't that the stray cat we sent to the... +Never mind... +So, have you named it yet?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:OTs-14 suggested that we call it Commander, and we'll be holding a secret vote behind its proposed namesake's back...
SVT38(0)<Speaker>SVT-38</Speaker>||:So you're not going to brood over the decision by yourself this time?
M1891Mod(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Your opinions all matter too, after all. +Besides,  I've got all the time in the world to think up a name with all of you now that I'm back!
