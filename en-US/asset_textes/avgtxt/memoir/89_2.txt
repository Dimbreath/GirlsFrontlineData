()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>73</BIN>:At the Griffin training facility.
()||:Bren is conducting a shooting exercise on her own.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:No change today either. +I have already optimized my reloading speed and shooting accuracy... +I've got to think. I can't remain stagnant...like the others.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Good evening, Bren.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:...Captain Welrod, what are you doing here?
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Looking for you, of course. +You've been here the whole day, haven't you? +Even a warrior made of steel requires sustenance at dinner time.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:If you're inviting me to have dinner together, no thanks. +I don't have the appetite.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:I was going to move this to a more casual setting... But if you're not in the mood to eat, then I'll just get straight to the point. +L85A1 and IDW are very concerned about you, Bren.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:...Oh. So? +You want me to go back and tell them cheerfully, "Don't worry, I'm fine"?
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:No, I'm sure that isn't what you want to do either. +I would simply like to know why you're angry.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:And is that somehow your business?
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Certainly. I'm the team leader, after all. +It is my duty as your captain to understand the difficulties you're facing and shine a light through the darkness that surrounds you.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:...Is that it?
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Fulfilling one's duty is a part of enforcing justice. +I will listen to you and help you find a way to solve your problem. +So if you have any reason to feel dissatisfied or confused, feel free to let me know, Bren.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Alright, then I want out.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:Out? You mean you don't wish to attend the tea party? +Then you could've just told L85A1 and IDW... What's there to be mad about?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Not the tea party, Welrod. +I want out from this team.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:What?! +...Why?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:This team isn't for me.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:...May I ask what makes you think so?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Instead of honing one's skills, you waste time on laborious things like tea parties. +It's impossible for me to grow any stronger on a team so carefree.
BrenMK(0);Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:I believe a reasonable amount of rest is also key to becoming an emissary of justice. +Besides, there are more than one way to grow stronger—
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;Welrod(0)||:Welrod, save your dull preaching. +I prefer handling things my own way.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||:... +Fine, Bren. +Since you have already made up your mind, then...I wish you good luck in your future endeavors.
()||:Welrod turns and takes her leave.
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:She...didn't stop me. +Ha...so that's what elite Dolls amount to.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:A few days later.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Bren...are you really leaving? +I'll be lonely without you around, nya...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:I, on the other hand, find it very agreeable. +After all, my ears will no longer be assaulted by high-pitched squawking.
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Um, Bren... Are you sure you won't reconsider? +We've been partners for so long...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||:I am very certain, L85A1. +Just stay and have your tea party. The Commander may even send you a fresh recruit who's happy to take part in your shenanigans.
BrenMK(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Bren... What are you going to do now?
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||:Join an elite squad on the front line, of course. +I will grow much stronger...strong enough for everyone to know my name. +Goodbye now.
()||:Bren picks up her luggage and leaves without a backward glance.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||:Welrod...is this really a good idea?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod Mk II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let her be. +She has temporarily parted ways with us in pursuit of something different... +But I believe our paths will cross again some day. +When that happens, we will all understand what it truly means to be "strong".
