G36(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Looks like it wasn't scorched after all.+A big part of Ai's neural cloud is encrypted and it's been eating up processing capacity. +Her internal memory is almost full, and if we don't clear it out, she won't be able to make new records.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:So it was a cache issue after all?
G36(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:That's not all. The same thing is going to happen again unless we delete the encrypted content. +(But just deleting it doesn't seem right either...) +...Just in case, I ought to take a look at it. +Would you like to go back for now, Gr G36?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:I understand. Would you like me to send your coffee over?

温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Is this my test Doll?
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:Yes, 59898 will be boarding the Assault Artillery platform in your place. During the test, all you need to do is give the appropriate commands and she will handle the fine details of control.
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||:That's pretty advanced.
冷静的男声()<Speaker>Calm Male Voice</Speaker>||:Well, that's what it says in the manual. If she can't do it, we'll have to complain to the supplier.+Now then, I've delivered the goods, so I'll be off now.
温柔的女声()<Speaker>Gentle Female Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:See you. +My, she really is cute. +Let me see, according to the manual, the startup command is... +"Good morning, 59898."
