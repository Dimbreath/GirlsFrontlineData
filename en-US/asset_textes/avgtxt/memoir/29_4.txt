AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Not fair! +That's so disproportionate!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's disproportionate?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:I'm talking about STEN! +RO only wished me good luck before she left, but look at what she did for STEN!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, think of it this way. +STEN has had an incredibly long streak of bad luck. +Let her have her moment, just this once.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:But I also want RO to give me suggestions on new upgrades! +I also wanna have new equipment, Commander!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't look at me like that. If you want it, file an application! +If your requests are reasonable, I'll give it a think.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:What?! Really?! +Then I'm gonna learn how to write a report right this instant!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do your best. You could also ask STEN for some pointers.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AAT-52 runs off, bubbling with excitement.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +So, why are you hiding behind the tree? +Still not used to your new gear?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Uh... I'm alright... +I'm just feeling a bit uncomfortable because of what AAT-52 just said...
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why should you be? +I had a chat with RO the other day. She did tell me to look forward to the result, but I certainly wasn't expecting this.
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Yeah, I kept the red beret. +Commander...you aren't disappointed, are you...?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Quite the contrary. +When I moved you over to RO's squad, I didn't think you'd undergo such a drastic change. +Did something good happen?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:No, in fact...my luck was still rotten. +But that's probably why Miss RO would give me a proposal for an upgrade. +If I become stronger, I can stand by what is right with stronger conviction – that's what she said.
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ah, justice. Is that what she meant?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Yes. In a way, she's quite like Miss Welrod. +Though she did want to give me a more serious demeanor... +But I thought it'd be a better idea to take this slowly.
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's wise that you've kept your friendly, girl-next-door appearance. +A sweet smile is a lot more effective than weapons when dealing with humans!
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:You make it sound as if...Dolls that look like pushovers are more popular...
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Can't be helped. Humans are that shallow. +What, disappointed in us?
StenMK2Mod(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not at all. +I was terribly confused, but not anymore.
()<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:That's right, an unyielding conscience is what points to justice... +So long as we never turn our backs on this belief, we will never lose our way. +And this...is how we will keep being the “shining beacon in a brave new world”.
