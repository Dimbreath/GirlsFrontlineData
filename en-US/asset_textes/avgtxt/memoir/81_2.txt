()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:Inside the dorms.
()||<黑屏1><Night>:M249SAW is sitting alone on her bed, not saying anything or even chewing her gum. She's simply sitting there in silence. +M60 and Mk48 are standing at the doorway, looking at each other. Neither of them knows what to say. +Or rather, whether they should say anything at all.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:In the darkness.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:...It doesn't matter if they can't fix me. If I die, just make a copy of my neural cloud.
LWMMG(0);M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:...You... Say that again?!
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>;M249SAW(0)||:If I die, just make a copy of my neural cloud. +In any case, a new me will take my place.
M249SAW(0)||<黑屏1>:Shut up...+<size=65>SHUT UP!</size>
()||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...That morning. +At the simulation training ground.
()||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:LWMMG, Mk48 and FF M249SAW are moving under fire.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||<震屏>:Tsk... What the hell is the technical department doing?! +I'm starting to think this training system hasn't been maintained for 800 years!
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:That's enough, Mk48. Save some strength to figure out how to get out of here in one piece.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Aw, what a pain... +It's all your fault, Lam, aren't your tactics always flawless? How did this happen...?
M249SAW(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Mm, you're right, I didn't consider there might be a mistake in the system's calibration. I'll remedy that next time. +Also, don't call me that while we're on ops.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:No way, your full name is such a mouthful.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:In any case, what are we going to do now?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:We're going to reach a random node soon, and it's likely that there'll be an artillery bombardment. +I'll cover you, so take this opportunity to get through the firing radius. Once you get to the resupply node in the rear you should be able to log off. Please be careful, everyone.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(...There she goes again. It really pisses me off.)</color>
()||:LWMMG moves up quickly and enters the random node. She steps up her firepower and opens fire at the enemy cannon emplacement. +At the same time, Mk48 and FF M249SAW withdraw. +As they pass LWMMG, FF M249SAW notices something about the way LWMMG is holding her gun. She looks... strained.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,5</白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hey, Le—

()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:There is a thunderous explosion. +Her ears are ringing. +Everything goes dark for a moment. 
()||<BIN>1</BIN><黑屏2>:FF M249SAW feels a forceful shove. The next thign she sees is LWMMG's hideously mangled body.
LWMMG(1)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Mk48, the simulation system has ruled me KIA. We can leave combat now.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:...Right.
M249SAW(1)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...Lam, why...
()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Three minutes later. +Outside the training ground. 
()||:FF M249SAW blocks LWMMG as the latter heads to the repair bay for an overall check-up. LWMMG turns to look at her. Her face remains largely impassive save for a hint of confusion.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:Lam! Tell me, why did you do that just now?!
M249SAW(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Do what? +Oh, that was from experience. Shouting a warning to you and waiting for you to respond would have been much slower than simply pushing you out of the way.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:I'm not talking about that! +If...if that hadn't been a simulated battle, you'd have been damaged beyond repair, do you know that?!
M249SAW(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Yeah, so next time, please don't slack off during ops again.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:The same goes for you, Mk48.
()||:As the thrust of LWMMG's words changes, Mk48 — who has been watching the argument with great interest — is taken completely by surprise.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:What? That was just ONE TIME... Alright, alright, I get it, I get it.
()||:LWMMG prepares to leave.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||:Lam, you...you're utterly unreasonable!
()||:LWMMG freezes in place.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:(Evenly) SAW, I have no idea why you're so angry. You are making it impossible to communicate.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:...Why, you! +Who exactly is making communication impossible here?!
M249SAW(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I simply pushed you aside. It's the same as how I cleared up the countless messes you made in the past. What exactly have I done to make you think that I am <color=#FFB6C1>utterly unreasonable</color>？
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:...It was my fault for screwing up during the op, but don't you feel like you owe us an apology? You could have been critically damaged! You could have died! +How is this the same as cleaning up after me? How could you overlook your problem so calmly?
M249SAW(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Apologize? Whatever for? +It doesn't matter if they can't fix me. If I die, just make a copy of my neural cloud.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Oi, that's a bit over the line...
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:In any case, a new me will take my place.
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:...
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:If you have no objections to my explanation, then I'll be heading to the repair bay. +While it was just a simulated battle, the system miscalibration and that explosion just now might have had an effect on—
M249SAW(0)<Speaker>FF M249SAW</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:<size=65>LWMMG! You dumbass! You massive dumbass!</size>
()||:LWMMG is taken aback by FF M249SAW's sudden outburst. SAW's voice was breaking. +She stares as SAW turns and runs off. She opens her mouth but doesn't know what to say.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Wow, I really wasn't expecting that.
()||:With that, Mk48 also marches off after FF M249SAW.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Just now... SAW did not call me <color=#FFB6C1>Lam</color>, did she?
