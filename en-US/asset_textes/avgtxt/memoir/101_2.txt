()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hey! Yes, you, the young lady over there! Over here, look this way!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<Delay>:...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is something the matter?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Congratulations!+You've won a super VIP-exclusive deluxe service plan!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Have I now?+Are you a service Doll from nearby? But I haven't made any purchases yet, you know?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You're an A-Doll too, right? Judging by your looks, you must be a high-end Doll employed by a PMC.+Our establishment is launching a new promotion targeted at Dolls like you.+Come in and spend with us and you'll immediately gain a huge amount of credits in return!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh? Now that sounds quite tempting... Sounds like I'll be able to make a lot of pocket money if I take part, right?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Exactly! If you have enough credits, you can buy whatever you want! Why not take hold of a chance like this?+Credits are a basic living necessity for Dolls! If they were illegal Dolls, for instance, our establishment wouldn't give them this chance, even if they wanted it!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That...does seem quite harsh.+And what if I said I was an illegal Doll?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Haha...you must be kidding. How could you be an illegal Doll, given the way you're dressed and the gun you're holding?+There must have been a reason why we were fated to meet in a place like this!+You can't go wrong with earning more credits.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Ja, you're right. +What was your name again?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Illegal Dolls aside, all normal Dolls have their own login IDs, right?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm...
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm Reina. +How about you?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm UMP45. Just call me 45.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:45... +That's a weird name.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There's nothing weird about it. We just do different jobs.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Alright then... +In that case, will you come with me, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And what if I refuse?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Then I'll be very sad.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:And what does that have to do with me?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Aw, we're all Dolls, please understand...+<size=35>I'm under pressure to perform, you know...</size>
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Fine, fine, how could a Doll like me make trouble for other Dolls?+I'll take a bit of time to look around your establishment. I hope your products don't disappoint.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:That's wonderful! You're so understanding!+Please follow me, you'll be able to gain lots of credits with just a few simple steps!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Are we there yet?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Soon! +We just need to get through this region...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I'm getting more and more curious about your "establishment", Reina.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Yup! Everyone says that!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Zzzzt... +Suddenly, 45 seizes up, wobbles and collapses to the ground.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Grunts)
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:... +Whew...finally took care of her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>89</BIN>:...Reina puts away the taser drone hidden in the shadows.
UMP9story(1)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:And here I was wondering what was so special about Tactical Dolls... Looks like any Doll will follow you obediently if they hear about earning credits.+If you want to blame anyone for this, then blame yourself for being too greedy. Heh heh, let's see what you have...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reina rummages through UMP45's things as the latter lies on the ground...
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:The only weapon you've got is this gun, huh... If you were hired as a bodyguard by a human, don't you think that's being too careless?+Oh well, forget it. No matter what you were used for, your body will sell for a good price once I burn out your neural cloud.+Let's finish up this piece of work then look for new prey on the streets!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Huh... +How come...
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You must be wondering — "How come I can't move?"
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:What...did you do?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:How does it feel, having someone approach you from behind while you're immobilized? It's kind of like when you're holding your breath in the water and almost at your limit, but just as you're about to surface and fill your lungs, someone violently drags you back under, am I right?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:What...what are you talking about...although that DOES sound quite familiar...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:After you were rolled out, didn't you have a professional technician to tell you not to go around casually touching other Dolls? +Especially...models who specialize in electronic warfare?
UMP9story(2)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:What, you're actually... +Wait, why didn't you shut down after taking a shock like that?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That shock of yours would have been enough to deal with an ordinary civilian Doll, but unfortunately I'm not an ordinary civilian Doll. +That whole kidnap-a-Doll-and-burn-out-her-neural cloud routine sounded really practiced... Is that how you make your living?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It doesn't look like something you could handle on your own. I'm interested in the people behind you; mind telling me about them?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:No... I-I can't tell you.
UMP45(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Really now? That taser drone of yours looks like it's still got more juice in it. I wonder if I can directly burn out that teeny little neural cloud of yours with enough current?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Ahhh...maybe this is what they mean by "there's always a bigger fish", huh...</color>
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>89</BIN>:Don't...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Please don't burn out my neural cloud...! +I don't want to...not in a place like this...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Isn't this is your "establishment"? +In that case, being melted down in a place like this is poetic justice of a sort, don't you think?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:I... I don't want to die yet... +Please...!
UMP45(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Humph. This is ridiculous.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:... +I... I can move?
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Huh? She's gone...? +When did she... +...
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I survived... +But why...why did she spare me, even after I did something like that to her?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>84</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Several days later. +Reina is walking down a familiar city street as usual. +But right now, she's not in the mood to advertise her usual "business".
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... +This is bad, I'm not good at thinking. +I just can't figure out why there'd be a Doll like that...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Don't tell me she felt that my body wouldn't sell for much? +If that's really the case, then she doesn't have much of an eye for merchandise! +But it's true that an ordinary Doll wouldn't have her skills, and she mentioned something about being an illegal Doll... What exactly IS her story?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Halfway through mumbling to herself, Reina grinds to a halt and smacks her cheeks.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>No, I can't keep thinking about this.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I haven't met my quota for this month yet, and if I keep wasting my time here...my neural cloud really will be melted down by those people!</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>I don't want to become a lump of scrap without memories! Come on, Reina!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reina surveys the streets for her next target. +Soon, she locks onto someone.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Ah, that Doll is...</color>+Fate must have led me to you again...45.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:Several days later.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I've followed her for several days now... Why does she keep wandering up and down this street...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>She doesn't seem to be looking for anything in particular. It's as though...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reina ducks behind a large storage container.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>It's as though she's just wandering around aimlessly...</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>But if I observe her for long enough, I'm bound to find some kind of clue...</color>
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Alright, that's enough.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Huh?</color>
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter where you hide with such poor concealment skills, Miss Reina.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...Ahaha~ +Hi, we meet again.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why are you following me?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Huh? I wasn't following you, I just happened to run into you, haha~
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You've been tailing me since the day before yesterday. You did it for four hours on the first day, seven hours on the second, and almost two hours today.+Frankly speaking, if you really do have such perverted tastes, you ought to modify your signal transmitter first. I could sense your presence from five streets away.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Alright, alright, it's not like I can control my own ID signal... If I could, I'd like to work like a normal Doll too.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm? Is that so? In that case, would you mind telling me why you've been following me all this time, Miss Reina the abnormal Doll?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:I was curious...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The more you know, the more likely you are to be destroyed. +Someone who walks on the edge of gray areas like yourself had better keep that in mind.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:I looked you up. I couldn't find any records on you through any legal channels. +So I figured...you're also an...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oho, you're smarter than I thought. Looks like I really should have destroyed your neural cloud back then.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:No! Wait! +Listen to me! +Right now...you don't have anything in particular you want to do, right?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Even if I did, it would be best if you didn't know about it. +If you try to get in my way, I really will get rid of you for good this time.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Listen to me... +I have a way for you to live better than you do now.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Coming from you? I don't believe it in the slightest.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Nothing's impossible as long as you have credits! +With enough credits, you can even make up for all the mistakes you've made! +I know a great underground technician, he can modify you and make you invincible if you can pay enough credits. That way you'll be able to do anything you want!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Is that the reason why you've been entrapping other Dolls all this time?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:You don't understand... This is a small city in the Yellow Zone. Just surviving here takes everything we have. Holding yourself up to pointless moral standards only makes you others' prey.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:How about yourself? You've done so much dirty business already, you ought to have enough credits to go anywhere and do anything.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:No... I can't go anywhere. +I don't know about your situation, but I'm...tied down.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You tried to trick me with credits in the past, so now you're using a sob story? +I can tell you right now that I've already left a backdoor in your neural cloud. If you do anything I deem problematic, I can fry your neural cloud on the spot.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:If you want to destroy me, then go right ahead. +What you're looking at is just a machine that's being controlled by a bunch of scumbags. +I had to make dirty money for those gangsters just to buy myself the free time to talk with you like this!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh? You said something very interesting. By "gang", do you mean the criminal organization that coerce you into Doll-trafficking?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Yes...that's right... What about it?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Do you find it shameful?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:I don't think that any Doll...that any human being should do this sort of thing! +I want to leave this life behind!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:45, can you help me?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why me?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:You're amazing. You're better than any other Doll I've seen. That's why I came to you. +You're the first Doll with electronic warfare abilities that I've seen in this city. +I know that gang put a Trojan into our neural clouds. If we defy them, they'll send a self-destruct signal through their terminals to get rid of us on the spot! +But if we can hack into Level II of the gang's server and wreck it, all the Dolls they control won't need to commit crimes in order to live.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A self-destruct signal...huh.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:That... What's the matter?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's nothing. +Is that the reason why you've been following me?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Actually, I only just thought of it...but it might actually be possible if it was you...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Though you're trying to move me with a tale of your tragic circumstances, you've just been talking about what you'll gain from all this.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Don't worry about that! +If we succeed, I'll give you everything I've saved up while working for the organization. +You'll get a huge sum of credits and I'll gain my freedom. An exchange like that is fair enough, right?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...And if you go back on your word?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Even I draw the line somewhere too. And besides... +I wouldn't lie about the only chance I have of getting free of those humans, least of all when facing a Doll who's way stronger than me. +You're amazing, and if I betray you, you can fry my neural cloud right away, right?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Alright, you convinced me. +In that case, I hope that you'll be paying me a satisfactory amount of credits.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Of course I will! I guarantee it!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:When's the best time to act?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tomorrow. We'll meet in an abandoned building in the old city. +The gang members are going to make a deal with another bunch of humans to sell ownerless Dolls. When that happens, there'll be much fewer guards around the server. +If we sneak in, there won't be a problem!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>:The next day. +...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:Kachak.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_door_storehouse</SE1>:This is it.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why are we in this run-down old building?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:To hack into the server, of course. The gang's base is opposite this building. The windows are shut tight, but I'm sure you can detect the machinery running inside it, right?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is a standard civilian signal interface... Is that the only one? Aren't there any backup servers?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:No. The organization controls the Dolls through that machine. They might be a gang, but they're made up of a bunch of uneducated bums. It's a miracle they managed to put together a server like it in the first place. +But I heard that there are servers belonging to other gangs around here. If we could obtain the encryption keys to their bank accounts from them...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We'll talk about that later. Doing anything unnecessary now will only ruin our plan.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Alright...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Preparing to infiltrate and connect.+Remember what I told you about how to bypass system authentication.
UMP9story(3)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<白屏1>:Got it, I made sure to save it!
()<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Ugh... I feel dizzy... +Were electronic warfare Dolls made for places like these...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This really is a simple system. +Got it. I've found the central signal control hub.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Huh? Isn't that way too fast? Didn't we just get in? +But how did you know this connection is...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is the only thing that fits your description. +It's connected to the signals of 17 other Dolls.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Is that the restriction module that the others were talking about... +But if we destroy it...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Ah! It's nothing! Don't worry about it!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This module doesn't seem to have any special protective or backup measures. +Are you sure this is the only module that controls the Dolls? +This level of security is way too low, even if the framework was written by a bunch of thugs.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Uh...um...that's the only one.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That'll be easy, then.+I'm going to make my move. Once I've destroyed the module, immediately clear our access logs on the server. +...Reina, why are you looking around?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:It's nothing! +I'm just worried...er...if any surprises might come up...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...We're on Level II, you know. You won't find anything even if you look around. +Forget it, let's hurry and wrap up here. Are you ready?
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:I'm good.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let's do it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Beep beep...
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:<color=#FF0000>【WARNING】 Module connection failed. Illegal access detected.</color>
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<震屏>:<color=#FF0000>【WARNING】 Activating highest firewall.</color>
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's forcing a connection? +This server wasn't as simple as I thought it would be. The firewall's trapped us here, Rei— +Oh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45 looks around, but Reina has already logged out of the server.
UMP45(3)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh my... This really is... Should I say it was expected or unexpected?
UMP9story(1)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>47</BIN>:...The central system will lock down the entire server once the restriction module goes offline. +Those humans were expecting Dolls to destroy the server... How could cracking it be so easy... Even if the restriction module was fine, the server would be locked down the moment it detected a discrepancy in the number of neural cloud connections. Good thing I ran quickly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Reina looks down at UMP45, who's lying unconscious on the ground as though in a coma.
UMP9story(1)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:17 connections, huh? +Thank you, 45. You can stay in that server and work for those scumbags in my place. +I'll remember that advice of yours about not casually touching electronic warfare Dolls, so this is goodbye~
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reina opens the door and prepares to leave the building the same way she entered.
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Reina looks back. UMP45 is still unconscious.
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...
UMP9story(2)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Dammit! What the hell are you doing, Reina?! +You're free now! Hurry up and get out of here and go somewhere else to start a new life!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:But even as Reina tries to convince herself, her hand refuses to let go of the door's handle.
UMP9story(2)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...Let go, let go, dammit! +Once you leave this place, you'll be free!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Reina falls silent for a moment and lets go. +However, she does not go outside. Instead, she turns back to kneel by 45's side.
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:She forgave me for what I did, and even helped me when she knew nothing about me... It's the first time someone's ever done that for me... +No, I can't... I can't just leave like this... +If I leave now, I won't feel good even if I can spend the rest of my life tanning on the beach! +I have to save her... That's right, maybe the processing power of two Dolls will be enough to break out of that server!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Reina connects to the server again.
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:If I can find the module controlling the firewall, I'll be able to lift the lockdown...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Huh? Where's the server?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...What should have been a region of cyberspace is now completely empty.
UMP9story(2)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:What...what's happening? What happened to everything that used to be here? +Don't tell me...I just connected to the wrong signal port? +Dammit, how could I make such a basic mistake at a time like this? I need to reconnect ASAP; there's no time!
UMP9story(4)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:Huh...why does my head feel so heavy...? No... I can't...stay connected...

UMP9story(0)<Speaker>Reina</Speaker>||:...45? +Why are you standing on the ceiling...? +Where is this place...? Am I still in cyberspace?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nope, you are definitely in the real world now.
