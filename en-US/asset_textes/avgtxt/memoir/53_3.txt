()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><Night><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:...In the forest near the HQ building. +A battered NTW-20 lies beside her bike.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:There's...an email from the Commander? +Is that the only way of contacting us? Just as well; I can ask for backup... +But first, I need to verify my condition.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:<color=#FFFF00>Commencing chassis diagnostics.</color> +<color=#FFFF00>Left arm missing. Abdomen damaged in two places...</color> +<color=#FFFF00>Energy depletion critical. Initiating power-conservation mode. The following functions will be temporarily disabled...</color>
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:Looks like I've taken major damage. I don't know if I'll be able to hold out until backup comes. +But forget about me... I don't know if they can hang in there...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20's expression turns gloomy.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:It would have been fine if they had just left me alone... +Why did they have to follow me...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20's hand makes contact with something sticky.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:Ugh, what's this tacky stuff?
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 pulls out a squashed container of maple syrup salad from her now-sticky bag.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点1>:...
PTRD(0)<speaker>PTRD</speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>167</BIN><边框>2</边框>:The four of us are like the ingredients of this maple syrup salad. We're all in this together. +When you try to leave the team by yourself, it's like the grapefruit in here trying to work its way free of the maple syrup. +You think you've gotten free of the shackles of the maple syrup, but in truth you've left a trail of it behind yourself...
PTRD(0)<speaker>PTRD</speaker>||<黑点1><边框>2</边框>:NTW-20, do you know what maple syrup is?
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:So they followed the maple syrup, huh...
()<speaker></speaker>||:The bio-detector on NTW-20's waist suddenly starts vibrating, though only for a couple of seconds.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点1>:TEC-9...
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>187</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Why are you so afraid of humans? Isn't the Commander human too?
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Have you heard of the "uncanny valley" effect? What I have is a kind of "reverse uncanny valley" effect... +I find it really hard to overcome that fear...
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:What if you got help right away when you were feeling afraid?
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I guess...it'd be better?
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Alright then, put this on. +Press it when you're scared. I'll follow the signal and come and get you.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker><Shake>||<边框>2</边框><黑点1>:R-really?!
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 reaches into a hidden pocket, takes out a piece of bread that TAC-50 hasn't touched yet, and eats it.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker><Shake>||<黑点1>:Bleh, this tastes gross...
TAC50(0)<speaker>TAC-50</speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>187</BIN><边框>2</边框><黑点1>:Because maple syrup makes even the worst-tasting food edible!
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:NTW-20 puts down the bread with a conflicted expression on her face.
()<speaker></speaker>||:...5 minutes later, NTW-20 gets back on the bike after performing some simple repairs on herself.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm just saving three hostages. I can handle missions like that with one arm tied behind my back. +I've definitely done harder things than this single-handedly. +Well, maybe not literally, but this time, I'm not alone...
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN><Night>:...In front of the HQ building. +After loading up their truck with cargo, the killers begin moving the Dolls.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:These tin cans look skinny and all, but they're freaking heavy!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:Ahaha, well, they are Griffin Dolls, they must be fitted with lots of combat-spec parts.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Then you come help carry them!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Shush, I'm waiting for it.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...In the forest near the HQ building. +NTW-20 quietly watches the killers load her friends onto the truck and pack them into transport capsules.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:Transport capsules...that means the Dolls won't be damaged even if the truck flips... +The plan's workable.
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 grips her bio-detector tightly.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点1>:...Wait for me.
()<speaker></speaker>||<BIN>187</BIN><黑点2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The truck drives through the desert at night.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Looks like the Doll that ran away isn't coming back. You lose.
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:Ahaha, I don't feel like I've lost, though.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Hmph, you and your big mouth—
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Blam— +Their conversation is interrupted by a sudden gunshot.
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Ahaha, you see, it's come at last.
()<speaker></speaker>||:A skinny figure comes into view in the rear view mirror. It is perched precariously on top of a motorcycle.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:Tsk, not having an arm makes everything harder. My accuracy drops like a rock and I can't even keep my balance. +I'll need to make sure I hit the tires with the next shot...
()<speaker></speaker>||:A window opens on the truck driving at high speed, and a hand holding a gun comes poking out.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Blam— +NTW-20 barely manages to swerve away from the shot, but the wound on her waist rips open a little more.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:(Gasps) Better stay in his blind spot for now. +I need to find a position that'll let me take a successful shot...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 moves behind the truck, keeping her distance but following it closely. +However, she doesn't expect the back of the truck to open up, revealing Killer B, who is wielding a gun in hand and laughing maniacally.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What?! Dammit...
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:If you stop and surrender now, you can avoid ending up as a pile of scrap. +Then again, you're pretty much scrap at this point, hahaha... +So save me the trouble and die already!
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:(Pants) I'll need to use the terrain to avoid getting hit...
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bang bang bang... +NTW-20 is forced to duck behind a sand dune to avoid a heavy barrage of fire.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||<BGM>10247</BGM>:Are you blind? It went that way! Hurry and catch up with it!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:Ahaha, have you forgotten that our main objective is...
()<speaker></speaker>||:Killer B grabs the steering wheel in exasperation and yanks it to the side.
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:Ahaha, looks like you're really seeing red.
()<speaker></speaker>||:The truck wheels around toward the sand dune where NTW-20 is hiding, exposing her to fire once more.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bang bang bang... +Sand sprays up all around.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:They're on me already... +If I take time to aim, I'll have a hard time avoiding bullets, and my body can't take any more hits... +All I can do is be patient and wait for a chance.
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:NTW-20 swerves in a serpentine course to avoid most of the bullets, but some still hit their target. +She catches her breath while the killer reloads. +However, the warning indicator flashing red reminds NTW-20 that she doesn't have much time left.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage9</BGM>:...Is this where I meet my end?
()<speaker></speaker>||:Just as NTW-20's vision starts to blur, the Dolls inside the transport capsules begin to wake up. +They struggle to rise, and see the heavily-damaged NTW-20 through the truck windows.
()<Speaker>PTRD</Speaker>||:NTW!
()<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:You can do it, NTW!
()<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:(Weeps) NTW!
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20's increasingly bleary eyes sharpen once more.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:I'm fine, you guys lie down for a bit. +Soon...I'll put an end to all of this...
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1>:NTW-20 puts on a burst of speed, as though she's suddenly thought of something, and overtakes the truck.
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Get it! Catch up to it and run that damn thing over!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:If we follow it, we'll stray from our course—
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Cut the crap—!
()<speaker></speaker>||:Killer B stamps down on Killer A's right foot and floors the gas pedal.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Bang bang bang—
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:This is the only way...I just need to hold on a bit longer... +Almost there...almost there...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 evades the incoming fire by ducking behind boulders, but more and more bullet holes appear in her torso.
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||:Whew— At last...
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_engine_speedup</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:NTW-20 sees her long-awaited chance through the murkiness of the night, and she eagerly revs her engine in a forward dash—
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:There's nowhere to run, trash! Just give up already!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||:No wait, that's—
()<speaker></speaker>||:It is only then when the killers realize they are heading straight toward a cliff. +And ahead of them, the one-armed Doll throws away her last chance at braking and turns around, taking aim at the truck tires with a smile on her face—
()<Speaker>Killer B</Speaker>||:Hit the brakes—!
()<Speaker>Killer A</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_brake</SE1>:I-it's too late—
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang— +The truck flips, rolling several times before coming to a stop on the ground. +Meanwhile, NTW-20 sails into thin air on her bike—
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:What a shame that it's nighttime. You can hardly see anything even though the angle's so good.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1><黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:The four of us are like the ingredients of this maple syrup salad. We're all in this together. +When you try to leave the team by yourself, it's like the grapefruit in here trying to work its way free of the maple syrup. +You think you've gotten free of the shackles of the maple syrup, but in truth you've left a trail of it behind yourself...
NTW20(0)<speaker>NTW-20</speaker>||<黑屏2>:Will you be able to find me this time?
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW's shattered body and bike plummet from the sky—
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—
