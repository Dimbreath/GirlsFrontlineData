MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Phew, that was close. +Almost got dirt on myself. +But this performance really is no joke. But I guess that's what you get with a military-grade module.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<震屏>:Huhhhhh? +Wait a minute... I'm confused... +Those Sangvis units were just pouring out... How come they all suddenly just...
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Nothing to be confused about. Tell the Commander that I'll be back later, Galil. +I still got something to do.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:But that was way too sudden...! +And where did this thing on you come from? How did you suddenly get new equipment?
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Heheh, unexpected, I know. +Thank goodness I was thorough in my search. I found this buddy in a random corner. +It fits me so I put it on..
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Jeez, that's dirty of you!
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:We can still go back. We might be able to find another one in the area. +If not...then sorry!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hmm...well... +But I don't really need...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Matching with compatible operation system...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Deny access.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Access denied. +Cloud synchronization failed.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:... +What on earth is this, Uzi? +I've never seen any intelligent module that actively connects to T-Doll neural clouds.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:It says it's a combat support system IOP developed for the military. +Why did you deny it access? It could help you find ways to improve your combat effectiveness!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:... +I don't like having my neural cloud poked around. +Especially by things of unknown origin.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Anyone can see that your weight loss plan is a complete failure without poking around your neural cloud.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:That's true, of course. +...Everything comes with a price. It might just not be upfront and visible.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:You sound more and more like Negev. You've changed since I first met you.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Even Negev has changed since we first met her. I don't know what you're getting at.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:The Negev-esque point you made is very true...+ But Galil... Saying "no" can also be a price. +Those who aren't prodigies all have to face this price.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:... +Fine. So what are you planning to do? +At least give me a reason so I can explain to the Commander why you're not back yet.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The safe house. +I need to go to the old safe house.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Huh? +... +You mean...the place we withdrew from before...?
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:【Administrator】 has already calculated the shortest route for me. I'll be back by daybreak tomorrow.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:But that area is in lockdown. It's crawling with things we have no hope of beating.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Things YOU have no hope of beating. That's why I'm asking you to go back first. +I have finally found...the purpose of putting on this set of equipment.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Are you sure nobody gave you that order??
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:... +Don't you remember, Galil...the mistake I made while withdrawing from the safe house? I was even scolded by Negev.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1>:...
()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,3</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1><CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:<size=55>LEAVE IT, YOU IDIOT!</size>
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,3</黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN>:I don't remember. +Let's go back to base first and talk about it later.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Negev ordered me to destroy all intelligence in the safe house, +But I let her down... +Because I was a bumbling...useless idiot...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:We'd been using the safe house for a long time and accumulated way too much stuff in there. +The ambush wasn't your fault, and Negev didn't blame you after the withdrawal, did she?
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:She simply didn't bother. After that, the reshuffle took place. +Was it even necessary...to reprimand someone shoved into the prep team?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Those notions of yours are as unhealthy as deep fried donuts. +It's not a good idea to dwell too much on what you did or take someone's words out of context.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:I'm not dwelling too much on what I did. The intel that I didn't manage to destroy is still sitting there. +No matter what's happened since then, I have to go back... +I must carry out the order Negev has given me...and prove myself useful.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:... +Sigh...I get it.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Trust me! +Let's have that ice cream together later.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:We'll see about that when we get home. +Now we've got a safe house full of nostalgia to visit.
AR(0);MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:No, you can't come with me! +You could be torn to pieces if we run into those scary enemies!
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;MicroUZIMod(0)||:Then why don't you just keep me safe? +That shouldn't be a problem for you now that you're so much more powerful, right? +Not to mention...don't underestimate the fruits of laboring under that maniac of a squad leader.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:Hmm...
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Are you questioning Micro Uzi's ability to fight alone, Miss Galil?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:... +Not at all? I'm actually dying to see what the new Uzi is capable of.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Refuse her, Micro Uzi. +She's only going to slow you down.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:A support system who can't even handle an extra person doesn't sound too impressive to me.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:Refuse her, Micro Uzi. +Her presence will introduce uncontrollable variables into the operation.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||:No, Galil is right. +I've been upgraded. We should be able to complete the mission no matter what happens.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Heheh.
()<Speaker>【Administrator】</Speaker> T-Doll</Speaker>||:... +As you wish.
MicroUZIMod(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Begin searching for enemies! +We'll blast right through whoever gets in our way!
()<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Those who can't prove that they can fix their past mistakes...have no future.
