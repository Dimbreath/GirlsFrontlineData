()||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><Night>:In the Griffin dormitory.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:My first live combat mission is tomorrow. +I should really be getting a good rest, but I don't feel like sleeping at all... +I guess I'm just too nervous... +Phew...relax, relax...
()||:...Half an hour later.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Ah...I still can't fall asleep. +The others wouldn't be at ease if they know just how nervous their team leader is... +......+Since I can't sleep, I might as well draw up a few contingency plans. +Everyone else is asleep, so I'll need to be quiet...so I don't wake them up.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2>:Inside the Operations Room.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hm...according to the map, it would be better to fall back from this direction if we encounter the enemy in this sector... +And if we exchange fire, we should attack from here...
？？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:So that's where you are.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Eh!? +Oh, it's you, AR-15... +Weren't you asleep?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||:...I woke up to get some air. +What about you, why aren't you in bed?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I couldn't fall asleep... +I felt restless while lying on my bed, so I thought I might as well do some planning. +That way, at least we'll have a response ready if we encounter any contingencies tomorrow...
M4A1(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Do you really need to do so much planning for a simple recon mission? +We might not even get a chance to trade fire with the enemy.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1>:I'm the team leader, so it's only natural for me to plan about these things... +Also, since this is our first mission together, I want to complete it flawlessly.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I see the corners of AR-15's mouth tilt up into a slight smile right as I say "complete it flawlessly". +Then, we talk about many things, including our mission and our own goals... +And we also talk about our similarities.+AR15 is as austere as always, but for some reason, it seems like she begins to loosen up as our conversation goes on.
()||<黑屏1>:......
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:AR-15. +Goodnight...I'll be counting on you tomorrow.
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:......+...That's only to be expected.
()||:AR-15 leaves.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +Only to be expected, huh...
()||<黑点2><BIN>83</BIN><Night>:I leave the Ops Room and look up into the distance. +The cool night wind blows away the confusion in my heart, and I'm certain of the direction that I'll be taking tomorrow.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.7</黑屏1>:In that case... +Leading everyone to victory is also to be expected.
