BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Being cut off here is really bad...
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Bren, I've locked all the emergency exits behind us. +We can only pray that they don't have enough manpower left to flank us...
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:Uwaah! I almost got hit... +Bren, I'm out of ammo!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:...SHUT UP. +Can't this annoying cat stop meowing even for a second?!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:But we're pinned down by heavy fire! If we stay here, we'll run out of ammo and rations soon!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Tell me something I don't know!
Welrod(0)<通讯框><Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:A voice comes through the comms channel.
Welrod(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Bren, what's your sitrep?
Welrod(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Our intel was off. Sangvis Ferri have us cornered in the fire escape within the abandoned base.
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:I've also run into more scoundrels than expected. It'll take some time to exterminate them.
Welrod(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:In other words... you can't help us?
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;IDW(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Not at the moment, I'm afraid. +I'll send you the blueprint of the base. Try to think of something.
Welrod(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:I have a general idea about the terrain around us. There's no way out!
Welrod(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Let me take a look. There may be something we overlooked!
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;IDW(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:That's right, IDW, It's time to make use of your intellect!
Welrod(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Don't worry, Captain, I will never give up, even to the end!
Welrod(0)<Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>;IDW(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:I have the utmost faith in you, all of you. The light within your hearts will surely pierce through the darkness ahead!
Welrod(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Oooooooh! I'm feeling so inspired right now!
Welrod(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:You two... +Get along surprisingly well.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:C'mon, Miss Bren! We can definitely finish off these mechanical abominations!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Wait, where's this confidence coming from...?!
Welrod(0)<通讯框><Speaker>Welrod MkII</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Go forth, the moment is here to protect the righteousness within you! Hold on till I make my way over to you!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:...Wait a second, Captain!
()||<BIN>34</BIN>:Welrod ended the transmission. At the same time, everyone received a copy of the blueprint.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:...For some reason, I feel completely hopeless. +Ugh...I'm dying for a cup of earl grey. +I even bought a new tea set last week...
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Pull yourself together, L85A1! +We must focus our attention on thinking of a way to break through.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:But what could we do...? +I only have two magazines left. We can't expect any reinforcement from the Captain... +We'll be shot the moment we peek out. Trying to break through by force is basically suicide...
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Dammit... Is there nothing we can use nearby...?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Nyahahaha...
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:IDW, have you lost it? Why are you laughing like an idiot...?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN><震屏>:Leave your escape to the professional bodyguard, ladies!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Sheesh! What's with the shouting? You scared the crap out of me! +This also is hardly the time to talk big!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:I'm not just talking big! +According to the blueprint, there's a ventilation duct throughout this passage. +We can sneak out by crawling through it!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Ventilation duct...? Can we even fit inside?
IDW(0);L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:We should at least give it a try!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;L85A1(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Hurry! If we're careful, they shouldn't notice us!
()||<BIN>34</BIN>:IDW consults the blueprint to find the hatch.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:There, that's the hatch! +Let me take down this panel first...
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:It looks really cramped in there... +No, there's no way I can fit through that.
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:If even L85A1 can't fit, it's impossible for me. +Guess we've got no choice but to fight our way out!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Wait, let me try!
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Yep, I can crawl through nyan!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:So you are a cat after all...you can slip through anything... +But...
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:In that case, I'll go ahead first. +I'll then flank them from behind to draw their attention, you guys can breakout when they aren't paying attention to this place!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:What are you thinking?! There's no way we'll let you go in there alone! +You'll be pulverized the moment you're out in the open.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Heheh, I'm a bodyguard. +Drawing fire might be the only thing I'm good at, but it's the least I could do to protect you!
IDW(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:...Stupid cat, is your neural cloud fried or something?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Taking risks is my specialty. You have to let me do my thing every once in a while! +Now then, I'll see you in a bit~!
()<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏1>:Hey, IDW! Hold on!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:IDW slips into the ventilation duct and crawls forward carefully.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I know... I'm an idiot. +I'm weak... and unpopular... but I'm still worth something... +If I can just prove that...
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:IDW crawls out of the vent.
IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I'll find a place to belong, right?
IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:You Sangvis idiots! The professional bodyguard is here!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Gunfight</SE1><黑屏2>:...
()||<BIN>55</BIN><黑屏2>:One hour later, the battle concludes. +As the echelon returns to base...
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:Hey, stupid cat, still alive?
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>55</BIN><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Ugh...it hurts... +Huh? No more gunfire... Is the fight over?
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:For quite a while now. +Looks like your neural cloud is intact...lucky you.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>55</BIN>:Heheh...I guess I do get a little lucky once in a while!
BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:You're still so cheerful even when you're missing limbs... +What did I do to deserve a teammate like you...?
()||<BIN>55</BIN>:Bren kneels down and carries IDW on her back.
IDW(1)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:Bren... +I thought you... hated me?
IDW(1);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:I simply have no interest in worthless weaklings. +But you... proved yourself useful to a certain extent. +...For now.
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>55</BIN>:Just be honest with your feelings now, Bren.
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:Keep your eyes on the perimeter if you have time for chit-chat, L85A1. +It's hard to fight with this stupid cat on my back!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>55</BIN>:Mhmm, I know~
L85A1(0);BrenMK(0)<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN>:W-why are you grinning like that?!
L85A1(0)<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>;BrenMK(0)||<BIN>55</BIN><黑屏1>:Ah...I'm just happy at the thought of a nice, warm cup of earl grey when I get back.
IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I want a cuppa too, L85A1!
L85A1()<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Sure thing. +There are four cups in my new tea set, that's exactly enough for all of us.
布伦()<Speaker>Bren</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:But that'll have to wait till you come out of the repair bay, stupid cat.
IDW()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Then I'm making a reservation for your tea. Oh, and your pastries too!
L85A1()<Speaker>L85A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Don't worry, IDW. You'll have your share of tea and pastries.
