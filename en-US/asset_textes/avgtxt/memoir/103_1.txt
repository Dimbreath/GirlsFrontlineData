()<Speaker>System Notice</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:...Training over. Please vacate the machine.
UMP45_Young(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ugh... I got the same results...
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Wow, only 12% accuracy in 30 seconds of moving target practice... +That's certainly rather pitiful.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I-I'm so sorry... I'm still doing so badly after making use of your battle simulation data...
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't sweat it. It could just be the idiosyncrasies of different T-Dolls. Even the same model could be different. +Besides, even I had to practice hundreds and thousands of times before I achieved such results.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:If I had a better fire control core...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Experience matters a lot as well. Improvement in battle performance isn't guaranteed even with a better core!
UMP40(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll eyes UMP45...
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I guess...? +To be fair, I never had a better core installed myself so I can't really tell either, haha...
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... (Sighs)
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Let's call it a day. The Commander left quite a while ago and you don't seem to be in very good shape. Why don't you go back to the dorm and take a rest?
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Danke.
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hmm? Why thank me all of a sudden?
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Whenever the training instructor saw my performance, he'd blow up and tear me apart. +Now he doesn't even utter a word. He just shakes his head, sighs and then walks off... +...If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even know what to do.
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:You don't have to thank me for this! It's barely a favor. We're both stragglers, after all!
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Right, enough with the depressing talk. Oh, you still remember what I showed you last time?
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Last time? What do you mean?
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter if you forgot. You'll remember the moment you see it. C'mon!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:UMP45 is dragged away from the training ground by the other T-Doll.
()||<SE1>RunStep</SE1><黑屏1>:The two Dolls' footsteps echo through the otherwise silent corridor in the base at night.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:The sound fades away and the motion sensor lights turn off one after the other.
()||:All is quiet except for the electric hum coming through her ear.
()||:...Come to think of it, who is she?
()||:I can't recall her, but she feels so familiar...and reassuring.
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Where are we...
UMP40(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:My dorm, but I've made a few alterations. Give me a minute...
UMP40(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She inputs some texts and figures at the control interface installed on the wall. +The inorganic wall surface comes to life instantly.
()||<BIN>162</BIN></黑屏2>:
()||:A blinding light shines for a few seconds and the most surreal scenery appears. +The azure water surface glistens with dazzling light and extends all the way beyond the horizon. +The sun shines brightly from up above without radiating any heat, but the sandy beach beneath their feet and the reflective ocean are highly indicative of a tropical climate.
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Wow... +This is gorgeous... I never thought the dorm could be altered like this... There are only boxes in my room...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Heheh, just some treats for completing missions. My previous Commander gave me permission to upgrade my room, so I got myself an LED screen and an image library! +Look at the light, the water! Amazing, isn't it?
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja... it's hard to believe...there's such a place in the world... +I'm always either training at the shooting range or waiting for my next order in my room. +Even when I'm out patrolling, all I see is earth and mud... +Such scenery is simply... unimaginable...
UMP40(3)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:There really is such a place. Look at the file name. It's called... the Maldives, I think? +This is probably an old recording from before the war. It's on the other side of the planet, even the stars are different in the sky. +I wonder if it still looks this beautiful there...
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Could this be... one of the pictures you took while out on a mission that you showed me last time?
UMP40(4)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hmm... I'd love to say yes, but sadly, that's not true. To be honest, I'm only ever sent to wander around just outside the base... +These are all panoramas I found in the image library meant to be used as wallpapers in dorms for changing the mood. +There are a lot of other panoramas. Want to check them out one by one?
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I see... all these other places are just as stunning...
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Ja, if only we could be dispatched to these places!
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I don't think we'll ever be sent so far away... +If even you can't go there, there's absolutely no hope for me...
UMP40(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:That's not true! Didn't I tell you before? Trust me, everything will change some day! +When our performance improves, we'll definitely get sent to better places!
UMP40(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP45's head droops slowly.
UMP40(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Arghhh! Don't make that face! If you get all depressed like that, all my effort will have been for naught!
UMP45_Young(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, no! Well, I just... tend to do that naturally... probably due to my initial preset...
UMP40(5)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I don't care if you do that naturally or not. It's not an attitude you should have to begin with! +We WILL change. Didn't you promise me?
UMP40(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||:She raises her fist.
UMP40(2)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I don't know how long it'll take or whether we'll ever set eyes on this very ocean. +I don't know when we'll get to bathe in actual sunlight along the equator and enjoy a proper vacation. +But some day... +...Some day, all this will change. When that happens, let's go together, okay?!
UMP45_Young(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... UMP40...
()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh...right... +I remember. It's her. It's UMP40...
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1><火花><黑屏2>:Why am I thinking of her now...?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN>:Wake up, 416! We gotta move!
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45!
UMP45(5)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Cough, cough...! +Was that... +...my auto self-diagnostic program? +It hurts...! +I didn't know getting shot would hurt so much...
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1Mod</Speaker>||:Don't talk! I've dragged her back!
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Have you actually lost your mind?! You can't be the real 45! She'd never do this for us...!
()||<关闭火花>:T-Dolls experience physical pain due to a warning system installed to prevent them from doing anything that would cause further damage to herself. +However, what is this searing sensation that feels as if her neural cloud is melting? +UMP45 can no longer tell which is more agonizing, the pain in her right shoulder or the blazing heat that scorches her from within.
