()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...That evening.
()||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><黑点1><Night><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><Night>:After LWMMG finishes her check-up, she reports the miscalibration of the simulation system to the Logistics Department. +On the way back to the dorm, she comes across Springfield carrying supplies, so she volunteers to help move them to the café, then ends up staying to tidy up. +It's only after the sky turns dark that she finishes up everything and returns to the dorm.
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><Night>:Inside the dorm.
()||<Night>:As LWMMG enters the room, M249SAW stops mid-sentence. +As usual, LWMMG sweeps up the hair littering the ground, then announces their routine training and schedule for the next day. +After taking it in, Mk48's face falls unsurprisingly.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker><Shake>||<Night>:Huh? This chicken feed again? Don't they have anything more challenging for us?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑点1><Night>:Also, SAW— uh. +<color=#A9A9A9>(Is it me or has SAW been really quiet lately...?)</color>
()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2>:...The next morning. After the routine training.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Mk48, don't keep trying to move past me in search of thrills. That leaves the rear open, and in actual combat, it's going to be a fatal opening.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:Yes yes yes, I got it... +<size=35>(Grumbles) It's all because this training is so boring...</size>
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:(Turns) SAW, your coordina— +Hm, SAW...
()||:FF M249SAW completely ignores what LWMMG is saying. The moment the training ends, she puts her gun away and skips off towards the doorway.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#A9A9A9>(Why do I have the feeling that SAW...is treating me like I'm not here?)</color>
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><Night>:Evening on the third day. +Inside the dorms.
()||<Night>:LWMMG stands outside the dorm entrance. She can hear FF M249SAW and Mk48 talking and laughing with each other, but when she pushes open the door and goes inside, FF M249SAW's voice abruptly cuts off. +FF M249SAW walks out of the dorm, still acting like she hasn't noticed LWMMG at all.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Mk48...do you think SAW's been acting a little weird lately?
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:(Exhales deeply) Oh thank goodness, you FINALLY noticed! +Do you know how miserable it is to be caught in a cold war between the two of you?
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Cold war? What cold war?
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:...Eh? +So by weird, you mean...?
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:SAW's gone quiet all of a sudden, right? +There's been a big change in her personality or something, is there a problem with her physical condition? +I've been observing her for the past three days. Should we contact the repair bay tomorrow? <size=35>(Mutters) I'm...a little worried about her.</size>
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:...Honestly. +I don't have it in myself to find this amusing anymore...
M60(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:Knock, knock.
M60(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night>:M60 leans against the doorway and knocks on the door several times.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||<Night>:Like I was saying, you kids are going to run into trouble without an instructor to look out for you,  you know?
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Ah, M60. +Is something the matter? The hour's quite late.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<BIN>82</BIN><Night>:Ahem. Naturally, I'm here to help you take care of a problem that you can't solve on your own.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:I...can't solve on my own...? +No... I'll be fine by myself...
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:If we really were fine by ourselves, then we should all become armies of one. Why would we need echelons or friends?
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:...
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:First off, there's that simulated battle you were in. +Frankly speaking, SAW and the rest of us, myself included, have no idea why you went up and took a direct hit from that shell. Was there no better course of action? I don't think so.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:At that time...it was my first reaction. +And also, my weapon's Imprint... +I was rolled out of the factory later, so it's only natural that I take on more dangerous tasks, isn't it...?
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<震屏><Night>:(Interrupts) Excuse me?! What did I just hear? +Are you saying that we're useless now? +Are you calling me old?!
M60(0);Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||<Night>:(Stifles laughter) Pffffff...calm down, M60⁠— Pfhaha...
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;Mk48(0)||<Night>:I heard you laughing! I'm gonna deal with you later!
M60(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:After snapping at Mk48, M60 composes herself and looks LWMMG squarely in the eyes.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||<Night><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Lam, you listen, and you listen well. +It's not as though anything <color=#DDA0DD>new</color> is automatically good or outstanding or the better choice between two options. That has never been a thing for us.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:(Silence...)
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:Everyone knows the result of that simulated battle; you were blown up. +Your first reaction was to block a cannon shell? Are you really so amazing? If you were that amazing, why would you get blown up in the first place?! Is that the standard of new weapons these days?
M60(0);LWMMG(0)||:
()||:LWMMG bites her lip, but says nothing.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:If you disagree with me, then become stronger and more reliable, and make your friends acknowledge your strength. +Similarly, if you insist on not caring about yourself, then go and get stronger too. +At the very least...you'll be more qualified to pull stunts like that.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:M60... +Do I...not care for...myself?
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Grey>||:
()||:M60 suddenly bursts into laughter. She enters the room, reaches out and flicks LWMMG on the forehead.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:<size=35>(Whimpers) Owie...that hurt...</size>
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:<color=#A9A9A9>(I kind of want to flick her too...)</color>
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:(Softens) Lam, do you know why we Dolls have emotion modules?
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Emotion modules... No, I never thought about that...
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night>:I once thought about asking the Commander, but I couldn't bring myself to do it... +But...after my time in Griffin, I think I have some insight into that.
M60(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<Night>:Why...is that?
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||<Night><黑屏1>:Yeah...why is that? +I think you should go figure that out yourself too. +Right, I'm getting tired, I'm going to sleep. Oh, and SAW's sleeping in my room tonight. See you around.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:With that, M60 leaves the dorm and closes the door behind her.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:After hiding behind the wall for a while, she turns to look at FF M249SAW, who is also leaning against the wall with her head bowed.
M60(0)<Speaker>M60</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(Whispers) I guess in the end, you need to explain the most important thing to her yourself...
()||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><Night>:At the same time, inside the room—
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||<Night>:Ha... Well, that was interesting. +You guys really do resemble those NPCs with minds of their own. I can't tell what will happen to you next.
()||<黑点1><Night>:LWMMG doesn't reply. She simply stares at FF M249SAW's bed, a pensive look on her face.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()||<BIN>86</BIN><黑点2><Night><BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:LWMMG goes to the backyard where M249SAW often hangs around and spaces out.
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:... +Mk48, we'll be punished if there's nobody in the dorm at night.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:(Laughs) I know that, so why'd you sneak out in the middle of the night?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:I don't know...what I should have done... +I'm feeling rather helpless.
()||:Mk48 walks over to LWMMG's side and sits down.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>||:You want to know what you should have done? +Of course you should have done whatever it'd take to stop all this from happening.
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Then, what should I have done to stop this from happening...? I don't want SAW to be unhappy because of me.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Ahhh, you're usually so bright, so why are you so THICK when it actually matters? +Didn't M60 say so just now? The simplest way is to get stronger.
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Will SAW be happy if I get stronger?
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Who knows? +At least, once you get stronger, you won't die no matter what kind of crazy stunts you pull.
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:... +Mk48, I thought...you wouldn't be bothered by things like this.
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Really? Maybe I'm not so different from SAW. Who knows? +But what you need to know is that nobody here wants to see another...you that isn't you.
Mk48(0);LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||:Mk48, thank you... Thanks so much...
Mk48(0)<Speaker>Mk48</Speaker>;LWMMG(0)||:Aw, don't go all mushy on me. +So, have you decided?
LWMMG(0)<Speaker>LWMMG</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yeah, all I need is to become a brand new me. +That way, SAW won't have to worry about losing me...
