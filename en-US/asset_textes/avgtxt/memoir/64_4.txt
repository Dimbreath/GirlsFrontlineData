G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Commander, Gr G36 reporting in.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Welcome back, Gr G3...6?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Too big a change?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's alright, but your hair... They didn't reattach it?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I am fine with this hairstyle. +I would like to keep it as a commemoration of what happened as well as a reminder to myself. +Does it not suit me?
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No, it looks great. +I feel bad for giving you a new assignment right after you returned, but I don't think there's anyone more suited for this task.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Understood. Please give me my orders.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I just sent you the details regarding this mission. +And take it eas...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Yes, Commander.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Actually, no. You're the only one who can pull this off, Gr G36, so please come back with perfect results.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Shake>||:Gr G36's eyes widen in surprise for a second. +But she quickly reverts to her usual stoic self and gives me a solemn salute.
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I am grateful for your expectations. I will not disappoint you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The next morning, at the café.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ahhh. Finally made it back. I'm knackered. +Running logistics with a bunch of rookies is so incredibly boring... +Hmm? What's this smell? Smells funny but also kinda nice.
XM8(0);G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Welcome back, XM8. +These are flowers brought back by my sister. This is also my first time smelling real flowers.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;G36C(0)||:...Huh, they're Gr G36's...? Not interested.
XM8(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;G36C(0)||:XM8 turns to leave and runs smack into the T-Doll who just entered.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoa! Wha... +...
XM8(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Oh.
XM8(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:XM8, about what happened last time...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:What about it? +Don't expect an apology from me. It wasn't my fault to begin with.
XM8(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Thank you for your word of advice. +We are still going to be on the same team, so I will be counting on you and the others.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Was it the Neural Upgrade? What else could've made a stubborn T-Doll like you say that? +Well...I'll cooperate, so don't worry.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:I'm glad things have worked out smoothly. +Where did you get these flowers, sis?
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:They were a gift from the child we saved in the last mission. +They smell nice, don't they?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Ja, I've never smelled anything like this. +So this is life, huh? How lovely. So supple, so beautiful and exuberant. +It must be nice to be given flowers.
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:These are gardenias, very uncommon even in cities in Green Zones. +The child gave me a large bouquet. Take one if you like.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:It's fine leaving them here so everyone can enjoy them. +By the way, you came back later than you usually do. Did something happen?
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Oh, I went looking for Gr PSG-1 after I returned to the base. +Her room was in such a mess. I must get her to tidy up properly one of these days...
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Haha...I've heard about that. +I pity her for being caught by you.
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But she was not in her dorm. I found her in the training ground. +I heard she had been frequenting it a lot these days. I came after having a chat with her.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:I can kinda guess what you said to her...
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I did not tell her off. I merely talked about our previous mission. +She took what happened too much to heart, just as I did.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:So...what do you think about it now?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Should I say...I have changed my mind a little...?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:You sound uncertain. That's not like you.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I am not sure if this is caused by the Neural Upgrade. +I have considered making more possible changes, but I will require help from my peers.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:It does sound like you've changed a lot. +Still, I love you all the same, both the way you were and the way you are.
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Now that I think about it, even you had told me many times to take it easy. +But I simply would not listen.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:It's alright, sister. +It's turned out for the best, right?
G36C(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Gr G36c's voice wavers with emotion as she smiles at her sister. +Gr G36 strokes Gr G36c softly on the hair, then on the shoulders.
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I would like to change the habit of taking all responsibilities onto myself and share them with my colleagues instead, the way I do with the Commander. +...That should free up my hands so I can do even more.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:To reflect on yourself and make changes...I'm very impressed, Gr G36. +So may I ask where do you plan to start?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Say... +Springfield.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Hmm? How may I help?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Would you mind preparing lunch with me today?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Pfffft. That's just like you. +Of course. I'd be honored.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:Um, sis... I'd also like to help...
G36C(0);G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Of course you can. Come.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;G36Mod(0)||:By deciding the dish...
G36Mod(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Please.
