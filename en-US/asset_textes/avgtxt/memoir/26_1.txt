()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>73</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM><黑屏2><Night>:...Evening, in the Griffin base. +At the training ground.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 flips through her training records and frowns.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Why don't they consider putting the modified Dolls in their own range... +It's really annoying when you can't beat their scores no matter what you do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thompson, who's been supervising her from the side, calmly looks over at Gr MP5.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Ha, now I'm wondering if you're upset at the modified Dolls or yourself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 waves the record sheet in her hand.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But they ARE stronger after being modified! +I don't want to be grouped with these Dolls for every practice session... My skill seems so useless...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:You're probably the only one who thinks that way. +I haven't heard any of the modified Dolls say anything like that, you know. +Still—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thompson pauses, and walks up to take the record sheet from Gr MP5's hand.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑点1>:—Your training scores are a little lackluster.+You can't slack off even if you've only been running logistics recently.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><Night>:...Later, in the Doll dorms.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5's bedroom is empty. She sits on her bed, holding her bionic piggy up in front of her as she puffs up her cheeks in anger.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I can't believe Master actually said I'm slacking off! That really hurt!+But it's true that I've been sent on more and more logistics missions recently...+When missions were being handed out last time, the Commander only sent Master onto the battlefield. I mean, it's Master, but I'm still jealous...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As Gr MP5 mutters to herself, she picks up her desk planner and checks it.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Groans) Let's see, what missions did I go on last month...collecting airdropped meat rations, patrolling elementary schools that are around the combat zones, and finding several cats?+Is the precious flower of my youth really going to be wasted on petty things like this?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 is suddenly struck by inspiration. She puts down her planner before turning to look at her bionic pig.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, I'll be able to escape this kind of life if I become stronger, right?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 jumps off the bed, then primly sits back down.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll go mention it to the Commander in the morning! That way, I'll be able to head to the frontlines right away! +Heehee, I'll get to show off in front of P7 in a new set of stylish, powerful gear!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2>:...The next morning. +Inside the base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 has gotten up especially early this morning and skips her way to the building where the Commander's office is located. +As she reaches the foot of the HQ block, Gr MP5 hears a languid voice.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Huh? Is the Logistics Department on leave today?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 pouts and starts running. She ignores the voice coming from beside her and tries not to think about how it's catching up to her. +XM8 pokes her head out and glances at Gr MP5 before walking over to her side.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Are you ignoring me, shorty? ♪ +Let me guess, looking for the Commander?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 freezes in place and glares at XM8 with round, angry eyes.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:That's right, I came to get the Commander's approval for my modification request.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 is momentarily stunned.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:A modification?
XM8(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Hehe, I'm going to request a tall body from the Commander, so you won't get to call me shorty again!
XM8(0);MP5(0)||:
()||:XM8's face recovers from the shock.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Oh? Well, that'll have to wait until you actually get the Commander's approval.+Still, what brought this on? You're pretty cute as a shorty.
XM8(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I suppose this IS kind of cute...what the heck! I'm going to get taller!+XM8, let me ask you, how long has it been since you've been assigned to a mission on the battlefield?
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Hm, let me think... Not that long? I went to scout a new S.F. base last week. +Why do you ask?
XM8(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I... The Commander hasn't sent me on missions like that in a long time. Don't tell me the Commander's forgotten me... +I mean, I'm clearly capable of standing on the frontlines! I'm very reliable, you know!
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Nahhhh, I doubt anyone would find a shorty reliable. I mean, imagine what would happen if we lost sight of you during a miss—
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>;MP5(0)||<震屏>:Owwww! Kicking people in the knee HURTS, by the way!
XM8(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;MP5(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:
()||:XM8 suddenly bends over and hugs her knee, then looks up to see Gr MP5 pouting, staring down at her with her hands planted on her waist.
XM8(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:How could you be so mean to me?! We're teammates and our rooms are right next to each other!
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||:Alright, alright... I won't mess with you any more. Hurry up and tell the Commander about it and come back quickly, I need someone to play chess with me.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 says as she makes a big show of opening up her foldable chessboard by the staircase downstairs. +Gr MP5 mutters quietly to herself.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I can't believe you're not scared of overheating on a hot day like this... I'll be right back!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:XM8 watches Gr MP5 run off into the distance and scoffs.
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Dolls may be able to upload their neural clouds, but if the Commander really lets that shorty onto the frontlines, I don't know which iteration of Gr MP5 is going to come back to play chess with me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...At the same time. +Inside the Commander's Office.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Huh?! Y-You mean it's not just a matter of submitting a request form?!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Of course not. +Also, we need to prepare an appropriate modification plan for you first.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 hangs her head, defeat written all over her face.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But doesn't that mean I'll never be able to take on a real combat mission...?
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:War isn't a good thing.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:That's just because you don't think I'm reliable, Commander! +I can...I can clearly handle a lot of tasks! But you keep giving me all these unimportant missions...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What gives you that idea...? +(Sighs) It's not that you're weak, Gr MP5... It's just that it might be too early for you to handle certain things.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MP5 says nothing. She merely stands in front of the Commander with her cheeks puffed up, like a kid who won't leave unless she gets her sweets. +The Commander looks at her and sighs in defeat.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Still, a somewhat tricky mission has come up recently, so I might have to trouble you to handle it. +Don't make me regret my decision...
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Somewhat tricky? Humph, am I going to have to find cats in the ruins again? How many will I have to—
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No. This time...you'll be going into a war zone.
