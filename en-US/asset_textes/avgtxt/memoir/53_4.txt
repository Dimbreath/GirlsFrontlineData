()<speaker></speaker>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:...In cyberspace.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:... +Since I woke up here, I'm guessing my body must be a lost cause. +Just as well, I can get a good rest now.
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 lies down, and the cyberspace transforms into the Namaqualand in August she remembers, with wild flowers springing up from under her feet all the way to the horizon...
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:I wonder how they are now? They should be fine in their transport capsules. +I doubt those two killers will be able to do much after a crash like that... +Huh?
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:NTW-20's mind is suddenly sucked out of cyberspace, as though someone had turned on a powerful vacuum cleaner.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><睁眼><BIN>22</BIN>:Huh? Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How does your new body feel, NTW-20?
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:It feels more agile than before, and I think my sense of balance has improved... +Right, Commander, what happened to PTRD and the others?
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:The Commander sighs, and remains silent for a while.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:... +Commander, why don't you say something?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:After you fell off the cliff, those two killers escaped and took the others... +They continued on to their pickup point after that, then we lost track of them.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:It can't be! I planned everything out...
()<speaker></speaker>||:The Commander places a hand lightly on NTW-20's trembling shoulder.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Pull yourself together, NTW-20. +I'm sure they wouldn't have wanted to see you like this...
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:...What about their neural clouds?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:This can't be happening...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, NTW-20. +Everything I told you... +...was a lie.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... +Ehhhhh?!
()<speaker></speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Three Dolls rush in from outside the door, full of life and energy.
PTRD(0)<Speaker>PTRD</Speaker>||:The look on your face was more interesting than I expected.
TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I didn't know you're as expressionless as ever when when you're sad.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:(Wails) I'm so glad to see you again, NTW-20!
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 looks conflicted as she's smothered by hugs.
()<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:So the mission was a success in the end?
PTRD(0)<Speaker>PTRD</Speaker>||:Yes. After the truck crashed, the steering conked out, and we managed to find the parts on the truck. +But by the time we found you, you were smashed beyond repair... +Good thing your neural cloud was largely okay...
TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:You were soooo cool during the car chase! +And the way you rode into the air! +Oh yes, I made some maple syrup sandwiches and maple syrup marshmallows for you...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem, sorry to interrupt. +Come take a look at your new body, NTW-20.
NTW20Mod(0)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:Mm, thanks, Commander
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We also upgraded your vehicle-riding modules. Now you should be able to ride a bike easily even with just one hand. +Oh, and one more thing...
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20 suddenly notices the three girls winking at her suggestively.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You should have noticed, right? Your equipment is well suited for jungle warfare. +Your next mission will be in the jungle, and there ought to be many opportunities for you to ride a bike. +I'll give you the details once you've fully recovered. +Now you can think about your teammates...
NTW20Mod(0)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||<震屏>:...Wait, teammates? And I'll be riding a bike again?
()<speaker></speaker>||:NTW-20's query is drowned out by the joyous cheers of the other girls.
PTRD(0)<Speaker>PTRD</Speaker>||:Looking forward to working with you again, NTW-20. ♪
TAC50(0)<Speaker>TAC-50</Speaker>||:I've always wanted to go to the jungle!
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:Y-you said you'd come save me if I pressed this...So I'm coming with you!
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏1>:Already dreading her next operation, all NTW-20 can do is close her eyes as the others pull her back and forth.
