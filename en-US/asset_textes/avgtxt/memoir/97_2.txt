()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I hate myself.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not just because I'm always rooted to the spot, too flustered to make any decision... +But it's because even despite knowing what dangers lay ahead, I allow them to proceed unhindered.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>224</BIN>:...At the quarantine wall.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Our mission is pretty simple. Just defend the entrance.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:It's the Military we're defending it from. That's hardly "simple".
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Nods)
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Haha...I was just trying to boost morale...
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You might as well change your tune... like set up a stage right here and throw a concert.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Stop teasing her. Just have more confidence in yourselves—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1><BGM>BGM_Pause</BGM>:Bang!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Ack, the Military is here already?! What do we do, Leader?!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No, that was me.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:...Thunder, why did you open fire?!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:To convey my feelings. +AEK said to change my tune.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:...
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_UnPause</BGM>:Humph, that did the trick. Now I'm motivated.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:R-Really?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I think I'm getting in the zone too. I'm ready to play this on hard mode.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Shakes head vehemently.) +No, no friggin way.
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M950A lets out a long sigh.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Is this really the time to show off? +If only Miss El Clear and Miss El Fail were here. Sadly, they've been assigned to another team...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:It is unfortunate, but it's Central Command's decision. Now that we're all here, let's go.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Then...where's our battlecry?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:The party's startin', you darn rascals!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Aah... Ha...!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Oorah—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The five members of Squad 【ATK】share a group fist bump and make for the battlefield...
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>10065</BGM>:The Military really is something else.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You're right. Their firepower is off the charts.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Hah, hah....
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Our leader's fully engaged her "mark mode".
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Shouldn't that be "note mode"?
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:950, don't move!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Huh?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><SE1>Explode</SE1>:Thunder yanks M950A to the left. The next second, Squad ATK's formation is completely broken by a barrage from a railway cannon.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Assault Team Leader</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Infantry and mech units, follow me! Get them all!
NPC-Soldier(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Assault Team Member</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yes, sir!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑点2>:We're separated from the others. This is bad.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:950, comms are being jammed too.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:... +We have to evade the Military! Start leading them around in circles!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Artillery fire fills the air. More and more Military units enter the fray and gradually have Thunder and M950A surrounded.
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Assault Team Member</Speaker>||:Fire!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:At the gesture of a Military officer, the five mech units closest to them shift into battle stance...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:And hails them with a rain of gunfire—
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:...Tsk.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:But the next moment, all signals of the Military units are disabled.
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M950A seizes the chance and breaks through the encirclement with Thunder in tow.
M950A(0);K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Over here!</color>

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Got it!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><SE1>Select</SE1>:Thunder uses this opportunity to reload.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Where's TMP?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Sprawled over there.
()<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Electronic invasion... The stress...is getting out of hand...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Just hang on for a bit. The Commander's train is already stationed at the entrance of the wall.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Do we have enough ammo?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Don't worry about that. We'll have enough to last us till the next show. After all, we're gonna get wiped out in just a few minutes.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:In any case, let's get back into formation and buy the Commander some time!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Thunder, why are you crying...?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thunder points into the distance.
M950A(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<黑屏1>:M950A directs her gaze to what Thunder is pointing at.
()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:What...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:BOOM—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>226</BIN>:A projectile from the Coastal Defense Artillery hits its mark and Griffin's train is blown apart.
()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:C-Commander...!
()<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:I'm not mistaken, am I? That's—
()<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Our train.
()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Any luck getting in touch with the Command Center?
()<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:No... I can't get through...
()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN>:Oh...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M950A slumps onto the ground.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thunder lowers her head. Her bangs cast a dark shadow over her eyes.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Sobs)
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:What the hell...so it's all over...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clap, clap. +K2 slaps herself on the cheeks.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:The Commander won't be defeated so easily!
()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:B-But...
NPC-Soldier(0)<Speaker>Assault Team Leader</Speaker>||:We found them! Fire at will!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Two Military Typhons aim at Squad ATK's location.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Pull yourselves together! +AEK and TMP, stay with me and keep the Military busy here. +950 and Thunder, go and rescue the Commander.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:... +...Got it. Let's go, 950.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Leader, are you sure we can handle such an important task on our own...?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Sheesh, where's your usual fire? +Perk up and—
()<Speaker>K2&AEK999&TMP</Speaker>||:Go, Griffin's Most Ruthless Prefect!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A&雷电</Speaker>||:...!
Thunder50(0);TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:(Raises hand) Please allow me to not tidy the dorm for a month when we get back.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;TMP(0)||:No.
Thunder50(0)()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Bang! Thunder fires at the sky.
