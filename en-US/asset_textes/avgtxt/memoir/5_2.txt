M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Is that... a carton of milk? +That's strange, who here in our dorm even drinks milk...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Good morning, Mosin-Nagant! +Wait, I haven't finished that carton you're holding, don't toss it!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I wasn't going to throw it away... +But I didn't expect you of all people to be drinking milk.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:They say drinking milk helps you grow taller!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Did I hear that right... M1895, did you of all people actually say that?! +Didn't you not believe in such things?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Hahaha... I was just giving it a try.
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:...How very suspicious. +There's been something off with you recently.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:R-Really?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:You've started drinking milk, you've been walking on your tiptoes, and you keep trying to touch the door beams... +This isn't like you at all. +Did something happen?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:...I just want to get taller!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Why are you suddenly so bothered by your height?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:It's been bothering me all this time, okay?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:But you never did anything weird like this before. +....Perhaps, did something happen that made you mindful of your height?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:It's nothing...
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I can tell that it's not nothing, so don't try to hide it from me. +Why not tell me about it?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:(Sighs) It's a little embarrassing to actually say it out loud.
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:How is telling your big sister about your difficulties embarrassing?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||<黑点1>:Alright, then... +But don't laugh when you hear it!
()||:...M1895 tells the story of her battle simulation with P38.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:I see...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:You're laughing, right? You just laughed! +You said you wouldn't laugh!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Fine, fine. I won't laugh at you. +So that means you want to get taller to beat the rookies, then?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Yes! That girl who calls herself an idol actually dared to call me a stubborn old hag... +And that quiet-looking Doll's words were barbed as well! +Newbies these days... None of them know how to respect an old soldier!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Well, they ARE new, after all. We're above losing our temper with children, aren't we?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:...But it's still hard to bear. +Seeing our hard-earned experience being rejected just like that... +No, I have to prove I'm right! +Once I get taller, I'll make them look at me in a different light!
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:It's good that you're so motivated...  +But the newcomers have their own ways of thinking too... +Perhaps the reason why you can't beat them isn't because of your height.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Don't tell me you agree with them about how we veterans are obsolete too?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:No, that's not what I meant. +I feel that when it comes to tactics... Perhaps we elders should learn to be more flexible.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...So even you think that way, Mosin-Nagant! +Forget it, I'll deal with this myself.
()||:M1895 snatches the carton of milk from Mosin-Nagant's hand before turning and striding off.
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) That girl's gotten carried away again. +...Perhaps a little setback might be a good thing for her.
