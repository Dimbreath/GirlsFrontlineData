XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><回忆>:There is always someone else who can do what you can't. Just leave things to the Commander.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:<color=#A9A9A9>Preposterous... How could I bother the Commander for something like this?!</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>But...if the Commander can really help me with this...</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>No, the Commander is busy enough as it is...

G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Gr G36?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Oh...! Good afternoon, Commander.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I don't often see you like this.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Like...what?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh... Dazed? Absent-minded? +It's rare to see you like this so I can't really tell either. Got something on your mind?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
XM8(0)<Speaker>XM8</Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><回忆>:There is always someone else who can do what you can't. Just leave things to the Commander.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版>:<color=#A9A9A9>(...Is that really a good idea?)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(But this is indeed a problem that I cannot solve even after thinking on it for so long...)</color>
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Earth to Gr G36? Anybody home?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker><Shake>||:Ah, please don't worry. +There is nothing wrong with me.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really? +Is there really nothing wrong with you if something is taking up so much of your internal processor that you fail to notice your surroundings?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I simply do not wish to...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm your Commander, Gr G36. +It's my job to help my T-Doll subordinates with their problems. +So, are you trying to make me fail my duties?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Apologies, Commander...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Just kidding, haha. +However, I think sharing your problem proves that you trust me.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:... +If you insist... +I AM rather perturbed by a certain matter. If I could borrow some of your time...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Of course you can. What is it?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36(0)||:Whatever it is, isn't it better to talk about it inside?
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Oh, Springfield. I have brought the ingredients for tea.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position><Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;G36(0)||:Perfect. I'll start the brew right away.
M1903Cafe(0)<Position>0,150</Position>;G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Thank you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:In the café. +I listen to Gr G36 talk about what has happened recently over a hot cup of tea.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:That is all... I am sure this all seems terribly banal for you, Commander.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You have reached your skill ceiling but aren't content to stop where you are and want to be of more use... +This isn't banal at all. I'm actually very happy that you have this attitude, Gr G36.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...Thank you for your kind words. +Still, wanting to become stronger is my own business. I should not be bother anyone with my complaints...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You can't grow stronger on your own. +This isn't just your own business, Gr G36. It requires everyone's support.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Everyone's support?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If one day, Gr PSG-1 and XM8 suddenly disappeared... +If one day, Springfield and Gr G36c were gone... +Would there be any point...even if you'd become incredibly powerful?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You may have been toiling endlessly for others and given more effort than most of your peers, but the people around you also have positive attributes that you lack. +They aren't merely there to help you fulfill your objectives. They're also examples for you to learn from.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:Learn...from them...?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Gr G36, you value courtesy the most out of all the T-Dolls here. +However, it is rather discourteous of you to never share your burden with others...
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:... +True... +I thought I had been hiding it pretty well, but I suppose...everyone already knows what I have been thinking...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Everyone wants to help. Why don't you give them a chance to repay you?
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:But even if I want to improve...it is practically impossible for my neural cloud to pick up a completely new operation method at this point... +I guess as one of the first T-Dolls manufactured, my neural capacity is a bit inadequate.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sure this is one of the reasons why you've been so anxious. +But now that you mention it, I'm thinking of a new technology discovered recently.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:New technology? +Could you be referring to a Neural Upgrade?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's right. You've probably heard what it's all about.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:My past self would have definitely turned it down, thinking I did not require it. +But now...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now, I also want to know what you think, Gr G36.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||:I... +Do you want me...to receive this Neural Upgrade, Commander?
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||: +<c>I can't say I don't.<c>I only want you to do it of your own accord.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I can't say I don't... All commanders want their T-Doll subordinates to excel.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:I understand. If that is what you wish...
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I want you to do it of your own free will, not simply because I hope you'd give it a try. 
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:Well now... +Other than expressing my gratitude, I do not know how else to respond.
G36(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You don't have to think about that. What matters is the choice you make now. +So, will you try it?
G36(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G36 looks at me with a strange, overwhelmed half-smile. +It's a strange expression, but I suppose that's exactly how she's feeling right now.
G36(0)<Speaker>Gr G36</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right now, I will definitely...
