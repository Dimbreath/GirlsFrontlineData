()||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:My head feels so heavy... +Is someone... Is someone calling me? +A voice reaches my ears, one that sounds strangely familiar. +I open my eyes at the call of that voice.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:......+I... Where am I...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏2>:...! + This... +A...AR...
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't squirm. +You're really heavy.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:... +Is that...really you?
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:Don't move your head. Hearing my voice should be enough, right?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why... +...I don't believe it! +AR-15... You...you're alive!?
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||:Let's get out of here first. I'll explain it to you afterward.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:But why... Why did you show up here and now...
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I have a mission of my own. Running into you was simply a coincidence. +But...I guess it's not a bad thing.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:...... +I'm meeting her all over again. +AR-15... She's still alive. +This should be a complete surprise to me— +This is the miracle I've longed for ever since she disappeared. +I should be greeting her with a smile. +But right now, I can't bring myself to do it. +All the people who helped me... +All the people who accompanied me, just as AR-15 had... +Where have they gone?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN><黑屏2>:Where are the others? +Where are SOP II...and RO?
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:...Now is not the time to think about them. S.F. elites are still around. +Focus on what's in front of you, keep quiet, and fall back with me.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>118</BIN><黑屏1>:... +SOP II... +RO...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0.8</黑屏2><黑屏1>2</黑屏1>:I...remember... +I saw RO and...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:No! I can't... I can't leave them behind! +Put me down, let me go back!
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||:Keep still! In your current condition, S.F. will capture you before you can take more than a few steps if I let you go!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:And whose fault is it that I'm like this!?
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏2><SE2>AVG_Rain2</SE2>:We had no choice but to sever your level two connection in order to break the link between you and the people monitoring you.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:The people monitoring me? +...Who? Who's monitoring me?
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:Did you really think Sangvis Ferri was our only enemy?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN>:What... What exactly is going on... +Isn't Griffin's mission...to wipe out Sangvis Ferri...? +I...I abandoned my teammates and my objective...
AR15()<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>117</BIN><黑屏1>:Whatever you want to do, get some rest first. +We'll give you the power you want after that...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:......
()||<黑屏1>:I should have led them to them an expected victory. +But now, I've lost everything...both my teammates and my target. +AR-15's words fill me with guilt and uneasiness, and I...I'm even more confused now. +What should I do? +... +I should be looking for them right now... +SOP-II...RO... +But I can't do that in my state. +I can't even control my own body. +I need power... +If only I had more power... +I... +...
