CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:The training session is over. I hope that'll be enough to save myself from getting into trouble... Now...
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:How about some cola?
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||<震屏>:WHOAAAAAA!!!!!!!
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Jeez...you're loud. +Why are you so scared?! Am I that scary?
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||:Isn't it scary to have someone suddenly put a freezing can of cola against the back of your neck?! +Can't you consider other people's feelings even for just a li... Hmm? What happened to you?
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:What do you think? Do I look cooler?
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||:Not really. I thought you were away on a mission after the combat simulation.
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Well...you could say it was a mission!
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||:So why are you here?
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I came to thank you.
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||:Thank me? For what? I don't remember doing anything to deserve your gratitude.
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:You know...uh...the thing with the combat simulation. +I didn't lose everything to Ouroboros thanks to you.
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>;M1873Mod(0)||:Just doing my job. +It's a pain to serve under a scatterbrain like you, but it's my duty to eliminate all Sangvis.
CZ75(0);M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:But that doesn't change the fact that you saved me. +This can of cola is for you. I'll be off now! See you on our next mission!
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Hey! +Sheesh... She wasn't listening at all. +...
()||:CZ75 pops open the can.
CZ75(0)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I could use a cold drink.

()||:I'm in the middle of a conversation with Makarov when a gust of wind whisks past my ear.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Commander! I'm back! What do you think? A brand new, more powerful SAA!
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Calm down. Calm down, SAA... My spine is gonna snap...
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Looks like you need to drink more cola, Commander!
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(I thought that stuff could only give me osteoporosis...) +We'll see about that. Welcome back, SAA.
M1873Mod(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Did you really get a Neural Upgrade? You seem even more heedless than before.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Of course I did! Wanna try me? +But before that, pay up.
M1873Mod(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:What?
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Your bet.
M1873Mod(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:That combat simulation was never complete. I am not paying.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;PM(0)||:But my teammate CZ75 was the one who defeated Ouroboros, so technically, I won.
M1873Mod(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...Dammit.  I won't let you win next time.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>;PM(0)||:We'll see about that!
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:My source of cola for the next two weeks is secured, Commander. Why don't we have a cola bath some other time?! It'll make your skin better!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh, no thanks... But why some other time? Are you busy right now?
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I have to find Tokarev.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I still owe her a "thank you". I'm not the sort to forget about such things!
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Then, catch you later!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Meet me here after you're done. I have a new assignment for you, SAA.
()||:SAA gives me a smart salute in return.
M1873Mod(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Rest assured, Commander! +This miraculous power will always be yours to wield, anytime, anywhere!
