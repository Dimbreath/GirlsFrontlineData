MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:... +Hey...Galil...
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ha... Looks like we can get off early today...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Then I can lie on the couch tonight and enjoy my snacks.</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:How can you be so happy...? +We'll have to continue with this kind of dreary, meaningless work tomorrow...
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Not just tomorrow. We'll be doing it the day after tomorrow, next week, next month.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>With the way things are, I just have to come up with something to make our lives easier.</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:But you're not like me. You volunteered to be on the prep team... +This is no job for Negev's aide, is it?
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>"Aide", you say...?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>It's precisely because I've been serving that fearsome lady for so long that I need a break.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Besides, Negev has enough people around her. She doesn't need me with her all the time.</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:Neither of us has actually met the newcomers...
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Doesn't matter. They'd known Negev before we were even in the picture. That's enough for me.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've never even seen Negev speaking so cautiously.</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:You're right... +I suppose it's only natural for useless people to be left behind now that she has more capable friends. +They're off fighting the military and those new things that no one has seen before, and here we are, picking up trash.
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not a healthy way of looking at things.</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:But that's the truth, isn't it? You yourself admitted that Negev no longer requires the service of certain people. +Compared to you, who volunteered to leave on your own, the one she personally dumps into the prep team is who she truly looks down on.
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're overthinking it. Negev never had anything bad to say about you, did she?</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:She might not have criticized me to my face, but we can see from how things have turned out. +I know full well how crap I am as a T-Doll... Negev doesn't have to say a word for me to know how many things I've botched up.
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:... +Haha...I think I've said too much... +Sorry, Galil. Just forget what I said.
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>No worries.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Let's head back when you finish the rest of your zone.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Then let's eat an ice cream! I managed to get my hands on some good stuff!</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:Huh? You'll put on weight if you keep eating high-calorie foods. +Who was it that kept complaining about getting fat and swearing she'd go on a diet?
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Today is Sunday. Surely I can indulge myself on the last day of the week!</color>
MicroUZI(0)<Speaker>Micro Uzi</Speaker>;AR(0)||:You indulged yourself the last two days.
MicroUZI(0);AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>B-but...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Oh! Some people consider Sunday the first day of the week, so technically I haven't feasted this week yet. There, I'm good!</color>
