M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Is that... Mosin-Nagant over there?
M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Good afternoon, M1895~
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:What are you doing here? +According to the schedule, shouldn't you be in training right now?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Didn't you know? There were new arrivals to base yesterday. +The Commander rearranged the training schedule, so my allotted time slot has been pushed all the way back till tonight.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Oh? We have new recruits? +Do you know who and how many of them there are, Mosin-Nagant?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:They should be Handgun Dolls like you. +I think there were three... no, two of them?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:...Honestly, it's one thing not to know their names, but you don't even know how many there are?
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Well, it's not like they're in our team... so I didn't really pay too much attention... +Besides, we'll go on missions together eventually, we'll get to know each other when that comes around!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Mosin-Nagant, as their seniors, we ought to take better care of our rookies! +Part of a veteran's responsibilities is passing on their experience.
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||:Yes, certainly... but it's break time now. +Want a drink, M1895?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;M1891(0)||:Nah, I'm going to eye over our new recruits. +I'm sure they'll need a lot of help, this being their first time here and all.
M1895(0);M1891(0)<Speaker>Mosin-Nagant</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Every bit the worrywart as always... In that case, I guess I'll just have to cheer you on~
()||<BIN>73</BIN><黑点2>:Inside the Griffin training ground.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Those two Dolls over there look like new faces... +Hello!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Excuse me, you are...?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:I'm M1895, one of the base's veterans. +Are you girls new?
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Ah, so you're our senior. +Hello, I'm P99. +I just arrived at this base yesterday, so I'll be in your care.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm P38, who came with her~ +I'll be this base's future idol, so please root for me!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:I-Idol? +What's that?
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Huh? You don't know what an idol is? +It's a big, bright shining star with lots of fans~
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:...Rookie, the battlefield isn't a place for you to hold concerts.
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Please don't mind her. +Was there a reason why you've come looking for us, senior?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:Ahem, it wasn't anything important. +I simply felt that I ought to give you rookies some advice, being a veteran and all.
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Advice, hm... +So, what suggestions do you have for us, then?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:Since we're Tactical Dolls, let's talk tactics. +These are the five tactical principles of M1895!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Number 1 - Obey your superiors' orders without question! +Number 2 - Carry yourself properly at all times! +Number 3 - When opening fire, do so as one! +Number 4 - Face the enemy head on! +Number 5 - Make sure you look cool in battle!

P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:...
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Why did you guys go quiet all of a sudden... +Don't tell me all that experience was too much to digest in one sitting?
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:...It doesn't seem very digestible at all.
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P99(0)||:...What?
M1895(0);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:Senior, as rookies, we're always eager to learn from the experiences of those who came before us... +But if I may speak so plainly, the suggestions you just gave us are outdated and not applicable to modern battlefields.
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:This goes beyond being non-applicable... +The way you cling to such antique doctrines, you would have died on the battlefield long ago if you weren't a Tactical Doll, isn't that right?
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:Y-You... how dare you! +Looks like the newbies are going to get uppity if I don't show my stuff!
M1895(0);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:You're on! +Someone obsolete like you will never become the idol of the new age!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Alright, but don't go crying to the Commander when I beat you!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...What am I going to do with you. +Senior, P38, calm down. +If you're going to compete with each other, you should remember not to go too far.
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Two hours later. +M1895 and P38's simulated battle is over.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:So much for being a veteran, it certainly didn't feel like it at all.
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:Dammit... you actually attacked my resupply points and got me from behind! +If you've got the guts, come face me in a showdown!
M1895(1);P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Firing in ranks is out of style nowadays, grandma. +Only a winner can become a true idol!
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>;P38(0)||:That's not true... +There's no way my experience could be wrong, there must be some other reason...
M1895(1);P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:A single simulated battle doesn't explain much. +Still, you should try new ways of fighting, senior. You might gain from it.
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:There's no point telling a stubborn old hag all that, P99. +I'm tired from grappling with her for so long... Let's get something to eat!
P99(0)<Speaker>P99</Speaker>||:...Might as well. +Excuse us, senior. We'll be taking our leave.
()||:P99 and P38 leave the training facility.
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Why did I lose... +Yeah, it must be because now, the rookies are all taller than me! +They're taller and have superior firepower, while I'm still short and petite... +Everything will be alright once I grow taller!
M1895(0)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1><黑屏1>:Alright, you old gal! Get a hold on yourself! +I mustn't let the rookies look down on me! +From today onwards, my goal will be to do my best to grow taller and stronger!
