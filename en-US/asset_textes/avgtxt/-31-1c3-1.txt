()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><BIN>169</BIN>:M4 and AK-12 steadily move deeper into the region where the defenders and the rebels are fighting.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:We've nearly cleared out the units in the sector around the lowest levels. +We're going to head up. After this, we'll be making direct contact with human rebels. +M4, are you ready?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Wait a moment.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What's the matter?
()||:AK-12 walks over to M4's side and finds that she is inspecting a human collapsed by the wall.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:This man's one of the wall's defenders. Huh, seems to be an officer, too. +As a human, he must have had a hard time holding out here by himself for so long.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:He's still alive... Was he blasted off the side of the wall? +Are you alright? Can you hear me?
Garrison Officer()||:(Groans) Who...are you...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm here to save you. +Hang in there, we'll get you out of here.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Are you serious about this, M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:Of course. I'll take him to a safe place. +It won't take much time.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Just now you were saying that joining this battle would lead to unnecessary complications, and now you're going to create an unnecessary complication of your own?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I have my way of doing things. +You stick to the plan and head to the upper level. I'll catch up with you soon.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You really do like doing things your own way... Fair enough. +Let me see what this unnecessary complication brings us. +I'll make a move first, then.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:AK-12 leaves.
Garrison Officer()||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Thank you, young lady...
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Please bear with this for a little longer, I'm going to take you to a safe place where you can take shelter.
Garrison Officer()||:(Coughs) No need for that... +...Head to the frontlines, more people need you there.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Right now, you need me more.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:... +... +M4 carries the officer into a sealed area where the quarantine wall segments are joined and gives him basic first-aid for his wounds.
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The bleeding's stopped, you should be fine now.
Garrison Officer()||:Thanks for the rescue.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No need to thank me, this is my duty.
Garrison Officer()||:You don't seem to be from our unit. +(Coughs heavily) ...Have things reached the point where we need to put a girl like you on the frontlines...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +It's fine, I'm a Tactical Doll.
Garrison Officer()||:What? I can't believe Dolls are so realistic now... +Oh, but still, thank you and whoever sent you to help us.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:My order is to help your unit repel the rebels. +In order to facilitate our movements, I hope you will tell your comrades not to attack me and my companion.
Garrison Officer()||:(Cough) ...Alright... +What's your IFF signal...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll send it to you now.
()||:The garrison officer picks up the radio on his webbing and opens a communications channel.
Garrison Officer()||:Attention all units... +The designated Tactical Dolls have been sent by our side to provide support... Do not attack them...
()||:...
Garrison Officer()||:Will that do?
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's enough. Thank you for your cooperation.
Garrison Officer()||:Can you tell me who sent you to help us?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...We just happened to be passing by.
Garrison Officer()||:Is that so...? I understand. +You have to stop them, otherwise the entire city will be doomed...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Understood. They won't get their way. +Take care of yourself.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2><BIN>46</BIN>:...M4 returns to the wall passage and meets up with AK-12.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I've solved the problem that was troubling you.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, I heard it all over the radio. +Did you plan this?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I just happened to come across an opportunity and took advantage of it. +It was all for the sake of making the operation more successful. +Also, Ange doesn't want to see unnecessary casualties.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...Is that really the case?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:What are you trying to say?
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:No matter how much you try to pretend you're a cold machine, you can't run away from who you are inside. +I won't hate you, even if you don't cover it up.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:...I didn't do it to make you like me.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(4)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I understand. +Go do whatever you want, provided it doesn't jeopardize the mission. +That way, I'll be able to see more interesting things.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(4)||:...You have terrible hobbies.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It's not like it's going to do you any harm now, is it?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Whatever, do as you please.
M4A1()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:<color=#A9A9A9>(It's not just who I am inside that I can't escape, but OGAS as well... What should I do from now on...?)</color>

()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:M4 and AK-12 support the defenders in an intense clash with the rebels.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN>:The enemy offensive seems to have tapered off. +AK-12, are they making any new moves?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The defenders are steadily encircling the rebels at the top of the wall. +The rebel forces have been cut in half and one of those halves is trying to escape...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Pathetic. To think they'd abandon their units to run away...
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Still, there's something weird here. The scans show that the fleeing rebels are heading toward the base of the wall.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:If they're retreating, that position would end up being flanked. It's not suitable for defense. There must be something fishy going on.
AK12(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:AK-12 connects to the comms network and reports the situation to Ange.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Did you hear that, Ange? The enemy's situation is a little abnormal. I've already sent you the distribution of their forces.
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The enemy's gathering at the base of the wall, huh...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Tsk... the surrounded rebel troops might just be bait. They've discovered that they can't seize control access for the entire quarantine wall and so they're using their backup plan.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That other group of rebels is probably going to try and seize the sector containing the wall control room, and then they'll try to open the wall up!
