NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Well done for passing another test.+Hmm...?+That's right. It was a test. So was your last mission, as are the next coming few.+To repel Sangvis Ferri, we must select outstanding commanders...+And make them into some sort of...'tactical reserve'.+Uh... Don't worry. We're not gonna turn you into canned food.+It's just that when the situation calls for it, we may delegate operations that are more urgent to you.+It entails great responsibilities, Commander, so please be prepared.+After all, Sangvis Ferri won't wait for us.
