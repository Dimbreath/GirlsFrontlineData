()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While they are stationary, they occasionally come under the NPC enemies' attacks, but three of the squad members make short work of them.+However, their leader remains motionless and gives her squadmates no indication on how to proceed. She merely studies the holographic map projected from her wristwatch with a delighted gleam in her eyes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:—Until one of her squad members has finally had enough.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Come on, don't you have a goal in mind, even if it's to win by killing off everyone else?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The objective is to win.+I explained that before we logged on.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Explained? All you said was "Let's go get paid!" and that was it.+What about a concrete plan of action?
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Aw, don't be in such a hurry, I'm sure 45 must be coming up with something.+If you're feeling bored, we can go trade shots with the surrounding NPCs~ Who knows, we might be able to pick up some ration cans or whatnot from them?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:You don't win by picking up cans!
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:But isn't this nice, 416? At least we can enjoy a good rest while we wait...

HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:What are you talking about, of course it's me.

HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:Oh... I forgot to hide my username.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Hide your ID?
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I think it's a game setting...+Players can't see each other's usernames for privacy reasons. It's the same for an ad hoc squad like ourselves.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:I know that, but why did you pick such a weird name?
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:You don't understand the wisdom behind this...but I don't blame you.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I don't give a damn about its wisdom, but I do NOT want to see that name again!
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:Fine, I won't let you see it, then.+Those enemies you took out just now dropped a lot of stuff, I'll go loot their bodies.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I don't care where you go as long as you get that username away from me.

HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Aw, don't be so hung up on it. Actually, Gr G11's username is pretty good. +I mean, everyone goes around calling themselves "Verminator" or "Lobocop", but I'm sure nobody can bear the shame of being killed by "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch."
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Just having someone with that username around me is shameful enough, okay?!
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:You're still on about that? I got all the loot already.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yeah yeah, you ought to relax and be more true to yourself. After all, it's just a game, right?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:You are the ones who brought it up again, aren't you?+Besides, you're basically rubbing it in my face!
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:It's okay if you can't appreciate my choice of username yet, but you'll understand its greatness once I kill an enemy.

HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:I only have a soda, does that work?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Of course not!

HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:Seriously, ever since we logged on, we've been woefully unprepared. +If you still have no idea what we should do next, at least let us look for some warm clothing to protect us against the cold?
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:Actually, I HAVE been looking for clothes, but for some reason all the backpacks along the way were emptied out.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:...You're right, I would have noticed it earlier if you had actually found any clothes.
HK416Mod(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Pink Nyan Nyan Punch</Speaker>||:Now who's bringing that topic up again?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Erk!+Forget it, I need to forget that ASAP.
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Still, these low-temperature environments are really dangerous. It's only a game, but it sure brings back memories.+Fortunately we don't have huge cannons firing at us this time round.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Fortunate or not, it doesn't change the fact that we're about to freeze to death!+Since we don't have clothes to keep warm, we should at least find a place to make a fire.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Aw, don't worry. What sort of game would freeze you to death right out of the gate...
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:Player "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch" died of hypothermia.

HK416Mod(2);UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This is bad, we'll freeze to death too if we stay here any longer!+What should we do next...? We don't know where that NPC called Dima has gone to either.+She was halfway through a greeting before she suddenly hung up, like we scared her off.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(2)||:There's something wrong with her. Or rather, this entire tournament is more than what meets the eye...
HK416Mod(0);UMP9Mod(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But you ended up joining anyway, didn't you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(2)||:Because Gr G11 kept nagging me... (Sighs) Well, I thought I'd humor her, but she got eliminated right away.+Also, if you really want the prize money, then we'd better get a move on before we all freeze to death.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Oi, 45!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hm~ This map of Manhattan sure is interesting.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:I thought you'd already logged out of Level II and fallen asleep.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I was simply taking my time to study the locations and status of the Griffin Dolls.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Wow, that's amazing! How did you do that?
UMP9Mod(3);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, I just made some "little preparations" to ensure our victory... Where's Gr G11?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:She froze to death because you were twiddling your thumbs.
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I see.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:What the hell do you mean "I see"?! We've only just started and we've already taken casualties! You really think we can keep on playing like this?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, Gr G11 was never suited to surviving in such harsh conditions. Besides, this is a game. Don't take it so seriously.+Come, it's time to enjoy the show those Griffin Dolls will be putting on for us.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Do you have a plan?
HK416Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A plan? Oh ja, a plan that will ensure an easy victory for us.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Then what about Gr G11?
