NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2><震屏>:...What?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A truck is making for the cathedral at top speed. Everyone present assumes it is rigged to self-destruct and prepares to fire at it, but it slams to a sudden stop and Marlohe hops out of the vehicle.
NPC-Maid(0)<Speaker>Marlohe</Speaker>||:These are the only vehicles we have. We might still make it if we leave with the VIP now.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So these banged-up trucks are our so-called reinforcements...? They aren't even armored!
NPC-KalinReporter(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Just be grateful we managed to find something.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:What should we do about the refugees? If we only have these unprotected vehicles, they might as well stay in the cathedral...
NPC-KalinReporter(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:That's right. Take a small number of elite Dolls and escort the VIP to the extraction point where the helicopter will be waiting. I'll allow the rest of your Dolls to stay behind and protect the civilians.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But the enemy's attack...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Their target is the Chairwoman herself. If we leave with her, we'll probably draw the enemies away. With just the ELIDs to deal with, I'm sure the remaining teams will be able to handle it. I second Mr. K's idea.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Marlohe will come with you as a guide. This is all I can give you.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But then the escort team will be at incredible risk.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, please have faith in us. +If we remain in this impasse, we'll be waiting for certain death. If we move, there might just be some hope for us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I turn around and see that RO and SOP-II have already prepped their gear and are all set to go.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:SOP-II, you alright with that?
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Of course! I'm the best at this kind of mission!
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:My plan is to drive through the city as quickly as possible. We'll send the Chairwoman off once we reach the extraction point. I've already studied the map. This sector is relatively less dangerous, so our team will retreat toward the city outskirts. Once the White Faction has been drawn away, you can also lead the civilians away from the city. No matter how you look at it, it beats hanging around in the cathedral.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑点2>:...Five minutes later. +RO, with her team and Chairwoman Ulrich in tow, sets off on the road leading to the river delta.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:My deepest apologies, Madam, for putting you in danger again. To tell the truth, I'm not sure if we can reach the destination safely. Judging from the previous attacks, the risks are very high.
RO635(3);NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Chairwoman Ulrich</Speaker>||:...I'm the one who should apologize. I know I shouldn't be the only one to escape. +But if this would give those civilians and children a chance to survive, I've got to give this a try.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:If everyone can make it to the destination, we'll all be safe... +That said...it didn't take the enemy long to catch up with us...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Marlohe looks toward RO, who nods. +RO turns to observe the commotion from behind the vehicle, only to find SOP-II already in battle position. +The enemies in pursuit are trying to gain on them, but they can't catch up to the truck's speed. +Just as RO starts to relax slightly and is about to turn her attention away...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Watch out ahead!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM><震屏><SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A sedan suddenly dives out right in front of the truck. Startled, Marlohe tries to swerve and avoid the car, but it's already too late. The truck loses control and crashes straight into the railings on the side of the road.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Tsk, I knew it wouldn't be so easy! Madam, are you alright?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 shields Chairwoman Ulrich with her own body while SOP-II and the other Dolls jump off the truck and prepare to defend the VIP.
NPC-Ambassador(0)<Speaker>Chairwoman Ulrich</Speaker>||:Tha...thanks, I'm fine...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Please stay on the truck and don't move. I'll take a look outside.
RO635(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, the White Faction are coming from behind!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Tsk, there's more of them coming from ahead! Even ELIDs! Dammit, we're trapped!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As they have observed, the truck transporting Chairwoman Ulrich is almost completely surrounded.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What do we do now?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We'll clear the road ahead while the others defend against the enemy attack from behind. Once the road is secure, we'll move the VIP on foot!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang! Bang bang bang!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Gunshots, echoes of artillery fire, running footsteps, mechanical whirs, and the splattering of blood as bodies of flesh are blown up... All these noises weave into the road's only refrain.
