Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker><通讯框>||:Greetings, Commander. I am Thunder .50, but you can call me Thunder. +For the sake of efficiency, I will save the rest of my introduction for later. I am now sending you the blueprints of the Sangvis command post. +There are many enemies around the S.F. command post that you intend to attack. +I would advise against engaging them directly to preserve our forces' strength. +This is an infiltration route I have planned. Please consider it and conduct your operation carefully.
