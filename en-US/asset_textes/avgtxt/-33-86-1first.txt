()||:【It appears that Griffin has passed through Tallinn.】
()||:【On a hijacked armored train, no less. Someone's face must be quite the sight right now.】
()||:【They won't be much of a threat with just a single train. The latest surveillance report is ready.】
()||:【The standard four-level protection system. It would be difficult to penetrate with that level of firepower.】
()||:【Unless the Griffin Commander crashes the train right into it.】
()||:【I don't know about anybody else, but this Commander might go ahead and do just that.】
()||:【That's true. I don't care as long as we won't suffer any casualties.】
()||:【Humph...】
()||:【Still no news from those who've gone in?】
()||:【There's EM interference. The signal has been jammed since they entered the base.】
()||:【Tsk... Honestly, who would believe this is an abandoned base?】
()||:【I never counted on the traitor. It would benefit everyone if she just disappeared in the base for good.】
()||:【Indeed. The train that's been keeping a safe distance away from Griffin has just passed through Tallinn as well.】
()||:【What a bunch of cowards. Keep up the surveillance and send a team to Tallinn.】
()||:【Roger that. I'll deploy the demolition team.】
()||<黑屏1>:【Have them bring more explosives. Make sure no one comes out of that damn base alive.】
