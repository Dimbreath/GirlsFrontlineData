VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:(Pants heavily)
()||:In the throes of her anger, M870 grabs a couple of bystanders by their collars.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Hey you, did any shifty-eyed Dolls pass through this place?
()<Speaker>Passerby 1</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Passerby 2</Speaker>||:...
()||:The two bystanders remain as they are and do not respond to M870.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...Why are your goddamn eyes open if you can't see the Boss standing in front of you?
()<Speaker>Passerby 1</Speaker>||:...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Trying to be a tough guy?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Leave it, M870. You can't interact with these bystanders.

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:P7, ART556, you two go check over there and see if you can find any trace of them.
()||:...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:P7? ART556?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:They didn't catch up with us...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:That's why I HATE working with those vertically-challenged Dolls! +They always vanish during critical moments, either they fall into the sewers or get stuck in weird places...
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:We need to go back and find them.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:What are you, a helicopter parent hovering outside a daycare? +Relax, P7 and ART556 aren't kids. They can take care of themselves.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:W-what do you mean by hovering around outside a daycare? +Anyway, I tried contacting them just now, but I couldn't get through. Their signals have been jammed.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Don't worry. A kidnapper's going to call and demand ransom soon.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:I was just KIDDING. You know, to lighten the mood and all that? Don't go taking it so seriously. +They might have already entered the Dark Zone.

M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Doesn't that make things worse? +They'll have a hard time dealing with the dangers of the Dark Zone by themselves.

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:We need to go to the Dark Zone right now.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...Fine, I get it. Let's head over there.
()||<黑点1>:After looking at VSK-94's eyes, M870 knows that she won't be easily swayed from her course, so she has no choice but to agree for now.
()||<黑点2>:Vector ends up passing by Bryant Park on her way toward the Dark Zone. +A pair of Dolls are calmly taking stock of their supplies amidst the grim, silent atmosphere.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Those look like Griffin Tactical Dolls. +Did Griffin have such quiet people among them?
()||:Vector makes sure her face is a smooth blank before heading towards the two Dolls...
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Also, I have a suggestion, M870.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:What suggestion?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:The decision to arrest people should be made jointly.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:The team leader decides policy. Got a problem with that? You want to overthrow me?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:No, that was not my intention.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I simply feel that some of your decisions are impulsive.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:What? Me? Impulsive?
()||:The sudden argument stops Vector in her tracks.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:... +Just hearing that bit of their argument makes me want to roll my eyes and blue screen. +Forget it, I'm not a likable Doll, I shouldn't force myself to socialize.
()||:Vector silently changes course and prepares to go around M870 and VSK-94.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I don't intend to make things difficult for you. +In the beginning, I had no objections to your fining AK-47 and the others for drunk driving.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Go on.
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:When you encountered Squad Springfield just now, they were simply collecting resources and they were very cooperative. +Yet you intimidated them with force and drove them to flee.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:They were running because they had guilty consciences!
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:While attempting to apprehend Squad Springfield, a lack of prior communication caused P7 and ART556 to be left behind. +We were low on manpower to begin with. Now it will be even harder for us to do our job.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Yadda yadda yadda, where do you get off lecturing me, anyway?
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:This is not a lecture. I simply wish to avoid unnecessary losses.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:YOU'RE the newcomer, I'M the team leader! +Don't think I'll keep letting you have your way just because you're a newbie. +When in Rome, you jolly well do as the Romans do, and if you want to operate on M870's turf, you play by M870's rules. +If you want to keep hanging with me, you'd better respect my authority!
M870P(0);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:... +So you insist on enforcing justice with your previous methods?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:It seems we have an irreconcilable difference in our interpretation of justice.
()||:A stone flies at M870 from nowhere. Fortunately, she ducks in time, and no harm is done.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Who did that? Who has the balls to assault an officer in broad daylight?! +You, that Doll over there! Was it you? +Yes, you, the one with the silver hair! Hold it right there!
()||:Vector unconsciously comes to a halt.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>...Should I just run?</color>
()||:While Vector is deciding what to do, M870 has already dragged VSK-94 up to her.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:State your username, suspect.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Tactical Doll Vector.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Wait, seriously? What year is this, do Dolls actually use their real names as their usernames? +Even when Nagant goes surfing (online, that is) she picks all kinds of flowery nicknames for herself...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:It's one thing to laugh at my username, but what was that in the brackets just now?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Don't mind her, she's the sort of Doll who runs her mouth too much.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Says who?! I just heard it from somewhere.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Well, uh, I have something to do so I'll be off.
()||:Vector is getting a headache from the exchange and can't wait to flee the scene.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Wait!
()||:M870 nimbly blocks Vector's path.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:There's something fishy about you!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:What now?
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Just now, you said I was throwing out charges randomly, right? +I'm going to prove to you that my charging process is transparent and accurate...
()||:M870 sizes Vector up.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Answer my question, suspect!
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:... +Are you talking to me?
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Yes, you! "Tactical Doll Vector!" +Just now, while I was discussing case details with the rookie, you tried to assault an officer and sneak away, right?!
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Don't think the entire world revolves around you. I was simply passing by.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:I don't believe you! +Talk! What kind of evil scheme did you have in mind?
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
M870P(4);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Are you always this direct when questioning suspects?!
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Don't butt in, rookie, I'm demonstrating proper procedure for you.
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I am on a mission given by the Commander to win this game.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:What proof—
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If you want proof, I will kill you right now so you can ask the Commander yourself.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:So you're trying to assault an officer again after attempting and failing to do so before?!
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If your definition of assaulting an officer includes simulating ways to kill you in my neural cloud, then yes, I am guilty of several thousand counts of assaulting an officer.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Humph, you've got quite the mouth on you. +Wait a minute, are you the only one the Commander sent out for this?
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I have two other teammates. They aren't with me now. +Is there anything else, Officer?
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Why aren't you traveling with them?
M870P(4);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I guess it's because I'm not likable.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;Vector(0)||:Hahahaha, I like people who are straight to the point like you!
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:<size=25>Too bad being unlikable isn't a crime...</size>
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:(Coughs) So, where are you going now?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:The Dark Zone.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...
()||:M870's questioning has stalled. +She frowns and studies Vector, trying to look for something she can use to pin a charge on her.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Can I go now?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Sorry for delaying you. You may leave.
()||:M870 looks at VSK-94 in surprise. Open disdain and exasperation are written all over the rookie's face. +It suddenly occurs to M870, "If I don't do something about this now, I'll lose her."
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Hold it!
()||:M870 blocks Vector once more.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:... +Can you just get on with it already? +If you want to fight, then fight. I don't care if it's one-on-one or in a group.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Humph, I know what you've done, Tactical Doll Vector! +You can try to hide it, but you can't deceive my eyes.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Pardon?
()||:M870 glances at VSK-94 and sees a look of doubt in her eyes. +M870 knows that she's a step closer toward redeeming herself.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Say no more. I know the answer already. +"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth!"
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Also, "There can only be one truth!"
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:How long of an incantation do you need to activate your skill, anyway?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:And that is— +You are guilty of —

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I have had it up to here with you.
()||:VSK-94 slings her backpack over her shoulder and prepares to leave.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Hey! Where are you going?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I'm going to save P7 and ART556.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...In that case, can I go now?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:I forbid you to leave!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oh?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:You're kidding, right? Do you think you can stop me?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Humph, then be my guest! +Let's see if you can go without my permission!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Oh, so you're not talking to me... +Well, I'll be—
()||:M870 tosses her backpack into Vector's arms.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Come on, fight me! +The loser has to obey the winner, no questions asked! Do you have the guts for it?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:My gut tells me you'll be weeping and begging for mercy.
()||:VSK-94 takes off her backpack and hands it to Vector.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:... +Look, I know I'm not that likable, but you don't have to do this, right?...
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:M870 strikes first and fires at VSK-94. +VSK-94 steps up onto a park bench and nimbly evades the attack. +After a perfect landing, she begins running deeper into the park...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Battle1</BGM>:Trying to get away so you can kill me from range? Don't even think about it!
()||<黑点1>:M870 immediately gives chase. +Vector sighs and sits down on the bench, still holding the heavy backpacks.
()||<黑点2><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Startled by the sudden sound of gunfire, the nearby birds all take to the skies, leaving behind nothing but a silent patch of trees. +VSK-94 has long since vanished, and there is no trace of her on the leaf-strewn paths. +M870 is keenly aware that the present circumstances are very unfavorable for her, so all she can do is slow down and carefully search for VSK-94's trail.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...
()||<SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:...A cool breeze blows, dislodging several leaves, which fall to the ground. +M870 turns sharply toward them.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...What the hell, scared the crap out of me.
()||:The moment she relaxes, there is a surge of killing intent from the branches of the tree opposite her.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:M870 raises her shield to protect herself while also firing at the tree.+VSK-94 sees that her sneak attack has failed and promptly repositions herself.+Though she is briefly shocked, M870 recovers in short order and mutters a few words.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:You're being way too vicious, rookie! How come you're aiming straight for my vitals? +I mean, I DID save you from a pack of alcoholics—
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Another lethal shot erupts from the depths of the branches. +Somehow, M870 survives it, but she loses a huge chunk of her HP. +M870 doesn't dare mouth off anymore. Instead, she rolls behind a nearby tree trunk and begins thinking about countermeasures.

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Hehe, step one is a success.</color>

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:(Squeals) It hurts! Don't hit me anymore, VSK-94! +I give up! See, I've thrown my gun away!

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Hehe...

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:...

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I already know what you're planning, M870.

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
