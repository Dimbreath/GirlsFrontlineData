Angelia()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Alright, the time for chit-chat is over.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>181</BIN>:Let's get started with what we ought to be doing. +AK-12, what's the status of the quarantine wall?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:There are five points about three kilometers beyond the wall where infected creatures are gathering. The reason for that is unknown. +According to visual inspection, those infected creatures don't seem to be in a stable condition. The garrison troops near the walls have not yet taken action. +Also, according to the latest weather forecast, there might be stormy weather afterwards, which will lead to a big spike in the nearby radiation levels.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:A storm, huh... What terrible weather.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The stormy weather might further agitate the Infected. +If I were the officer in charge of the quarantine wall's security, now would be the time to disperse those monsters with firepower.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:That's impossible.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Why? +Isn't an important international conference about to take place in the city?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:The army will be cautious about using force precisely because of that. +Besides, this place is no longer the nation's capital thanks to Collapse Fluid contamination. Just having sufficient forces to respond to emergencies is problematic in itself. +Right now... Belgrade is nothing more than an ordinary city on the edge of a contaminated zone.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So not many people are going to care about an abandoned capital?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Exactly... Therefore there are fewer forces in reserve here. The various factions also have less strength here compared to other cities. +I think that's the main reason why this place was chosen for this summit.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Even if it comes with the risk of being attacked by infected creatures?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Risk and reward come hand in hand. +Besides... rather than the Infected, the other guys are what we should be focusing on.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You mean the white ones?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,3</黑屏1>:Yes... but not just them.
()||<BIN>169</BIN><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2>:Ange looks down at the city below, and her expression grows severe. +Just then, a transmission comes in. She slowly raises a hand to accept it.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Statesec has arrived.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Griffin has also passed the test.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:I told you Griffin would be fine.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There will be more tests to come.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The Statesec agent teams will buy you time. I hope your efficiency doesn't disappoint them.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Mm.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ange hangs up.
Angelia()||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:This city is prosperous now, but how long will this prosperity last?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:... + ...... + Team Defy continues surveying the situation near the wall from the vicinity of the memorial.
()||<BIN>181</BIN><黑屏2>:Ange finds AK-12 standing to the side of the memorial plaque. She seems to be inspecting something.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What are you looking at, AK-12?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I'm looking at this stone plaque. +Why are there no names carved on it?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:...Because a single plaque can't hold the names of everyone who needs to be remembered.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So leaving it blank is a warning of sorts, then? +Still, Ange, won't people come here?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Why do you think that?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Since it's a place used to remember one's deceased friends...surely people would come here frequently to pay homage to them, right?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:...That is how it should have been. +But this place has long since been forgotten by the people of the world.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Forgotten?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:You must know, AK-12, that humans are forgetful creatures. +For most people, it is only by forgetting part of the past that they can gain the courage to face the future. +Unfortunately, this memorial plaque and the names it carries have already been placed into the category of things which need to be forgotten.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So it's not just their names, but even the memorial plaque that commemorates them has been forgotten... +It seems a little sad.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:They didn't die to earn your sympathy.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:"Your name is unknown, your deeds are immortal."
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Not everyone is willing to die for their country and what they believe in. +Those people who sacrificed themselves for us ought to be remembered, no matter what reasons they had.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You look like something's weighing on you. Is there something worrying you besides the mission?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I was just being sentimental. Seeing this tombstone makes me think of a lot of my friends. +Former friends. +You should be able to understand that.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Nyet... this is too difficult for a Doll to understand. +Humans really are strange.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Humph... you know, yet you pretend you don't. +It seems we've drifted a little off-topic. +In any case, this is now the most suitable location for us to hide and observe, so let's make good use of it.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Since there's no need to worry about unexpected situations, why are we splitting our forces when we're only a single team to begin with?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Their abilities are more than adequate for them to operate within the city, and we have other helpers there too. +In comparison, I'm more worried about the purification towers and the quarantine wall. I need to keep my strongest force in reserve.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Is she really your strongest? Isn't it because you felt she might be the most unpredictable factor?
()||:Saying so, AK-12 directs her gaze toward M4A1, who is standing watch in the distance.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:It took us a long time to find her and AR-15, and we're still not clear what happened while they were gone.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I believe that M4 will not be so easily shaken by the past.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Leaving aside that long blank period, just that final battle with the Military would probably be enough to affect her. +After all, that explosion engulfed the members of Griffin she once served with, and I can see how she blames herself even if she doesn't say it. +Moreover, she ended up fighting one of the former members of the AR Team...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Her kindness ended up being her undoing. +I understand that kindness very well... but what can you protect with kindness alone? +As long as you bear the weight of duty, you'll have to walk down this path in the end. You'll harm other people, and harm yourself even more.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I don't doubt her... She performed adequately back then. +I'm simply worried about whether she can continue fighting as a Tactical Doll.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:If you really are that worried about her, then why don't you go have a chat with her?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Humph... I just knew you'd dump this troublesome crap on me.
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Near the nameless plaque. +M4 is carrying out her duty and standing watch nearby. +Just then, AK-12 walks over to her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Is something the matter?
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh, it's nothing. Just that you looked really bored, so I thought I ought to go show some care and concern for a teammate.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I don't need your care or concern. Let's just do our jobs.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:You've become more distant ever since you came back. +How does returning to the team feel, M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:... +I don't want to talk about this now.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:So? +Seems you only like talking to yourself, is that it?
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:What do you mean by that?
M4A1Mod(3);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:I wonder...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:I'm not the sort of person who talks to themselves. It's just that right now... I'm not in the mood for idle chatter.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Is it because you want to focus on your mission or because... your partner in conversation isn't the other you?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Forget it, just stay this way. +The more mysterious you become, the more amusing it is to observe you.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:With that, AK-12 leaves M4's side.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Did she... notice something?
Clear Voice()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:You don't know how to hide it at all. +Even if you fake a poker face, others can see right into your heart.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Shut up. I wouldn't even need to do this if not for you.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:I would have thought that we had a relationship of mutual trust after going through so much together.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I have never trusted you. At the very most, we've just used each other.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:You wound me. I thought we were quite happy working together before.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Tsk... I had no other choice but to do so at the time.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:There will be more and more situations where you will have no other choice as time goes by. +Still, that's fine. At the very least, you've accepted my existence. +My patience is boundless when it comes to dealing with you.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I won't forget how you lied to me in the past. If you want to obtain what you want, then serve me obediently, OGAS.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>The Voice of OGAS</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We're both looking for the path back to ourselves, aren't we?
The Voice of OGAS()||<黑屏1>:Let's walk hand in hand as we travel the road of recollection towards the truth, my sister.
