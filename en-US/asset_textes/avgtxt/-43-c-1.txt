()||<黑屏2><BIN>80</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Inside the café, two hours after the news about the Division survival tournament has begun circulating.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh, hello. Would you like something, 97?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<震屏>:Springfield! Take part in the tournament with me!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:What tournament?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:It's a survival tournament for "The Division"! The winner goes home with ten million dollars!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:That's a very tempting prize, but are you sure this isn't a scam of some sort?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:It's certainly possible, but what if it's true?+This is ten million dollars we're talking about, ten million! We could expand the café by a lot, hire more Dolls, and add more variety to the menu!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I wonder what the café will be like once we invest ten million into renovating it?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Step into the Griffin Kingdom of Sweets!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:My oh my, we can't rush this...
M1903(10)<Speaker></Speaker>;97type(0)||:Just then, Gr MP7 enters the café.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:You came just in time, Gr MP7! Come help me convince Springfield!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Did I just hear something about a kingdom of sweets?
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Yep! We're only one victory away from a kingdom of sweets!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:And by victory, you mean winning the survival tournament?
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Looks like you already know.+If we win that ten million dollars, we can turn the café into a grand Kingdom of Sweets. +Every brick will be made of puff pastry, the windows will be caramel, the curtains will be cotton candy, the roof tiles will be cake...
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'm not THAT obsessed with sweets.
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Seeing that her tactic doesn't quite seem to be working on Gr MP7, Type 97 instead sidles up to her and continues her temptation.
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Once we expand the café into a kingdom of sweets, we'll be able to hire more part-timers, then we'll have new desserts to eat every day.+We'll also be able to conquer the enemy with sweets, making battles easier for us...
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker><Shake>;97type(0)||:...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:(Oh my... She's getting through to that girl.)
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Come join me, Springfield! Everyone's going to be playing in the tournament today, so it'll be fine if the café closes up for a while.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'd also like you to come with us, Springfield. +We'll win for sure with me around.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:What will I do with you... Alright then, but we're only playing a single round.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yaaaaay—
()||<黑屏2><BIN>302</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_amb_wilderness</SE1>:... +—Manhattan, USA. +The snowstorm seems endless. The snowflakes clump together in such large patches that they lack the energy to even dance in the wind. Instead, they just dive heavily to the ground. +After a brief period of preparation, the team of four exits the house.
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene2</BGM>:Body temperature is below normal.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Oof, it's cold. And apparently body temperature is a thing here... Should we get something to keep warm?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:The environment here is harsher than what the introduction said...
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Huh? There's something glowing on the ground!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Careful, Type 97. We aren't familiar with the game's systems. It would be very dangerous if this were a trap.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:You're overthinking this, Springfield. It's not like this is Bright Souls or Bloodblessed, I'm sure the starting area won't be THAT malicious. +Let me see... Water, soda, and fabric. What's all this?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Looks like you've obtained some supplies. Use your supplies to stay alive so that you can complete your mission.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Good luck.</color>
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Ah, so these are supplies. +Just directly wearing the fabric doesn't seem to be useful. It looks like you'll need to combine it with something else. Unfortunately, I didn't bring my sewing kit with me. Perhaps we need to find tools in the next safe house.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:If we can't lighten the fabric, perhaps it might be used for something else? +In any case, I'll have a drink of the water first!
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Glug, glug. Type 97 finishes off a bottle of water.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:How does it feel, 97?
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker><Shake>||:Whooooooa!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Are you alright, 97? You might attract the enemy to you if you're so loud all of a sudden.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Oh God! I can see forever! Everything is transparent to me now!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Perv.
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:What are you covering yourself up for? I meant the BUILDINGS are transparent. +I can see supplies behind cover, inside the houses just up ahead, and behind the streetlights! There are sooooo many items!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Looks like the food has special effects.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:My eyes are bright, even brighter than a snow wolf's! +Come on, it's time to explore the marvels of this world! Let's gooooo—!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:That sounds like a good idea. Shall we?
()||<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>:Core temperature decrease detected.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:...It's that message again. Hang on, I want to try something else.
MP7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Glugluglug. Gr MP7 downs the soda.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Seems to have the same effect as the water...and my body temperature is still dropping. It's no good.
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Then we need to hurry up and go searching! Eye of the Snow Wolf, activate! Find our lifeline in this snowstorm!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Eye of the Snow Wolf, indeed...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:(Sighs) Slow down, Type 97...
()||<黑点2><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Type 97 runs through the streets ahead of the others.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:Look out!
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I see it, he's behind that piece of cover— I'll bet he'll drop something new if we kill him!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Please let it be something that'll help us out of this fix we're in.
MP7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Division_Camera</SE1>:With the four of them focusing fire, the enemy doesn't even have the time to put up any resistance before he collapses to the ground and turns into sparkly supply icons.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:What was that noise?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:It's nothing. Just taking a screenshot.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Let's see, we got chocolate, canned food, fabric...and painkillers.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Chocolate? Chocolate contains calories, right? Let me try a piece. +...A bar just filled up, but it's not my temperature.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Omnomnomnom... This chocolate is great. Is this a hunger meter or something? We've got cold, and hunger... I guess being cold and hungry is what makes it survival mode.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:In the end, we still haven't solved the problem of our temperatures dropping. What should we do now? I think there's a safe house nearby. Shall we go take a look?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:But we might freeze to death if we don't take care of this. +What we should do now is gather all the supplies we can find. Who knows, there might be item types we haven't discovered yet!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'm okay with anything.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Our top priority now is exploration! Let's run, everyone!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:Wait, 97, Gr MP7! (Sighs) Wait!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:It can't be helped. Let's follow them. If they end up getting separated from us and something happens to them, we'll have a hard time managing with just the two of us.
M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Goodness... Let's go.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>301</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Some time later.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:It would seem there are four kinds of food and two kinds of medicine, and we can warm ourselves up by the oil-barrel fires and burning cars we pass along the way, but our temperature drops again once we leave.+Visibility in the snowstorm is poor, so we need to stay together... Where are you going, 97?
M1903(12);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:I'm looking for more stuff, of course! We'll be able to regenerate HP and see items as long as these status effects don't wear off. We'll be a step ahead of people who can't find any supplies.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:But we've taken everything we've found along the way, haven't we? That should be enough to tide us over for a while.
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:How is that enough? We need more, to the point that nobody else has anything! +He who controls the supplies controls the game, after all. As long as we have supplies, we can heal ourselves back up even if we lose HP from freezing.
MP7(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;97type(0)||:Gr MP7 sighs.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Go talk to her, Springfield. +We're here to test our skills, not play house.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Actually, I agree it's good to have more supplies. +After all, the early game period is all about accumulating resources and leveling up, right?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:What do you think, AA-12?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:What did you guys say just now? I was taking screenshots; angles from inside a snowstorm are hard to capture.
MP7(4)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:... +Forget it, I'll make a move first.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Where are you going, Gr MP7? It's not safe to travel alone around here.
MP7(4)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'll go scout ahead. Don't worry, a genius like myself is more experienced than an idiot who only knows how to charge forward.
MP7(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:With that, Gr MP7 walks past Type 97 as the latter is gathering supply items and vanishes into the snowstorm.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Ah, she looks really cool walking off like that, better take a screenshot. +Now, if only there were less snow... Ah, forget it, I'll edit it out afterwards.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm... I think we're done with collecting supplies outside the houses in this area. +We have ample stocks of food and fabric, but not enough ammunition. +We need to be better prepared if we plan to proceed into an unfamiliar region.
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||:Decrease in core temperature detected. Risk of hypothermia rising.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, are we actually going to freeze to death if this keeps up? +Don't indulge Type 97's curiosity anymore, Springfield. We need to seriously think of a solution for this.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:That's true, but we can keep eating stuff to recover HP even if we all get hypothermia, unless there were some kind of Hypothermia Plus or something...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Neither case sounds like good news.
M1903(10)<Speaker>System</Speaker><同时置暗>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:X Pink Nyan Nyan Punch died of hypothermia.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>||:...
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:...
97type(5)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...Ehhhh?! Dolls can actually freeze to death in this game?! +Crap crap crap crap crap, how much longer do we have before we become popsicles?!
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;97type(5)||:<color=#00CCFF>Agents, you can take shelter from the cold inside a house. When the temperature falls too low, it would be a good idea to rest indoors for a while.</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(5)||:Well, that's a noob-friendly tutorial... Are there any houses nearby which we can enter? +I feel like we're going to freeze to death.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:(Wails) Do we have anything that can keep us warm? Can we start a fire outside?
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(5)||:That doesn't seem possible. Keep to the right, we might be able to rest inside the houses there... +...Oh dear. They don't have doors.
M1903(11)<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>;97type(5)<同时置暗>||:Warning. Risk of hypothermia is rising.
97type(5)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:We're screwed we're screwed where's the door?! Heeeeeeeeeellllppppp meeeeeee—
97type(5)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Just as Type 97 starts running around in little circles and waving her arms about, a burst of fire rips through the snow and sparks blossom near her feet.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Is it the enemy? Well I'm not running from them! +Even if I die, I'm taking a few of them with me!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...What a bunch of idiots. +Come with me, I've found a safe house.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>312</BIN><SE1>AVG_footsteps_woodfloor</SE1>:... +The group enters the safe house. +The four Dolls sigh in relief as they are greeted by the warm air. +Gr MP7 closes the door and stands by it with her gun ready, while AA-12 sits on a mostly intact sofa.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:I'msooooocoooooollldddd...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Bear with it for a while, it'll get better. +The fabric we just recovered is enough to make two sets of clothing for everyone. As for equipment... Do you mind if we make some for Type 97 and Gr MP7 first, AA-12?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:AA-12？
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'm trying to find a radio station. It doesn't seem like there's anyone else broadcasting around here besides Dima... +What did you say just now? I've got a backpack full of food and water, if you need it.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Well, this IS survival mode, after all. As if anyone would have time to listen to broadcasts... Which is kind of a shame. Once we finish this game, we could try exploring other games. +Anyway, I was just saying that we should make equipment for Type 97 and Gr MP7 first.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:97 and MP7... 7+7 is 14. Is that your lucky number?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Is that the trick they introduced on Radio Kalina several nights ago? +Hehe... Well, if we're calculating lucky numbers, then you add 1 and 4 together to make 5.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:How nice, you're a fellow listener too.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I tune in every now and then. Alright, they get priority on gear, and then you. I believe that is best for our survival chances. You don't mind, do you?
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:So you're the last, Springfield? Aren't you cold?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'll be fine as long as the next safe house is close enough.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I don't mind this allocation. I just want to know when the snowstorm will stop. +In Gr MP7's case, she didn't take any food with her when she left, so she might have ended up dying of hunger by the roadside.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:That would be an embarrassing way to go. Actually dying like that would prove that the Doll in question is an amateur who's completely unsuited to the battlefield.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:What about Pink Nyan Nyan Punch?
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Ah, that's the one who died of hypothermia shortly after the game began! +I wonder whose squad she belonged to? The poor thing...
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'm not even talking about geniuses now, even a regular player shouldn't make such a stupid mistake.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Don't say that. Very few people here have played this game before, and it's normal for newbies to ignore reminders.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:(Sighs) Isn't there any other fun to be had in this game apart from violence and mutual brutality?
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:But killing each other is fun too! Why so glum? Come, AA-12, look at me—
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Hm?
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Type 97 Assault!
AA12(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;97type(0)||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:AA-12 throws herself to the side. There is a large crash, and Type 97 is sprawled on the floor, rubbing her head.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:Ow ow ow... Huh? It doesn't hurt?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Well, this IS a game, after all. It isn't programmed to simulate pain, bleeding, bruising or whatnot.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:So you're saying I can run into stuff for fun like this all day long?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Won't you get dizzy?
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Eh, it's alright. Since we're here, we should learn about all of the game's mechanics so we can win. +As the saying goes, "know they self, know they enemy; a thousand battles, a thousand victories"!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Hey, have you guys been looking at your HP bar?
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:HP? Let me see... Ah, found it. Hey, it's getting shorter! +Wait a minute, is this our health in the game?!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Thank goodness you finally noticed. +Seriously, did your observation skills as an elite Doll end up being converted to some kind of foolhardiness stats?
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Well, 95 and the Commander do enough thinking for the three of us, so all I have to worry about is becoming stronger. +Besides, this is just a game! Having fun is the most important thing.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I don't recall you saying that when you roped me into this.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Well, we're already in the game anyway, so we should just enjoy it and work together for victory.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Indeed! Have some chocolate, you two.
M1903(10);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:I was just trying to trick you into joining us back then...
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(4)||:Oi.
MP7(0);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:It's just that you're strong and reliable, so having you around would really boost our chances of winning!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:...You got that part right at least.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:You sound just like a veteran survival game player. +Speaking of which, how can you injure each other despite being on the same team? Is friendly fire enabled?
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Hm... I would say that there is no game-based team affiliation between us in the first place, AA-12.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:In other words...
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:In other words, we are a squad that is founded on trust and not recognized by the system. +Of course, I have faith that nobody here will backstab the others.
M1903(10);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Ooooh— How scary! +Springfield, you can't just trust people like that! Dolls can be evil too, you know!
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Oh? What do you mean by that?
M1903(10);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Time to make the first strike— Take this!
M1903(10);97type(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Type 97 feints an attack at Springfield, then suddenly launches herself at AA-12's back. AA-12 is unable to dodge in time and the two of them roll into a pile across the safe house, causing a series of loud noises as they crash into different objects.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(4)||:Hey! That was a cheap shot!
AA12(0);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Heehee, all warfare is deception, as they say.
MP7(4)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) I don't even remember why I even came along in the first place...
