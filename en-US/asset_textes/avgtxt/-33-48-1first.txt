()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM><Night><BIN>208</BIN>:... +On the roof of the military armored train.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How many shield generators left?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Three more to go!</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:<color=#00CCFF>Now just two!</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:There should be one somewhere around here... Found it!
()||:ST AR-15 maneuvers herself nimbly as she evades the attack from the machine gun turret and darts around to its blind spot. +She finds the shield generator in a spot behind the turret and promptly destroys it with a shot.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:One more. +RO, where's the last one?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Somewhere near me... But enemies are coming out from the doors! I need some help!</color>
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dammit... I'm also pinned down here...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:A blast interrupts ST AR-15.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...All shield generators destroyed!</color>
()||:ST AR-15 looks down to the side of the train and sees M4 packing up her launcher while running in their direction.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I believe it's mission accomplished, Commander. Do you copy? All shield generators have been destroyed. Please prepare to blow them up!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Jeez. Did you have to take credit for the most ostentatious shot?
()||:ST AR-15 sighs with mock exasperation, her lips curling into an almost imperceptible smile.
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Well, I AM the team leader. All echelons with me! We need to get off right now!
()||<黑屏1>:All T-Doll echelons quickly disembark from the military armored train, and Griffin's artillery fire makes short work of it.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:A few minutes later, on Griffin's armored train.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:Holy... That plan was way too reckless...
Commander()||:But they did it, didn't they?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I can't believe we actually took out an armored train in a direct confrontation. This was absolutely unthinkable in the past...
Commander()||:Having been through so much, we're also much stronger than we used to be. +Still, those were just their autonomous troops. We'll probably be up against their main force soon. And we haven't even reached the destination of our journey; that was just the beginning.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:The Paldiski Submarine Base... This feels like a one-way trip...
Commander()||<黑屏1>:Even if it is a one-way trip, we must press on. Our friends are still waiting for us. +Contact Persica. When M4 gets back, we have a lot to discuss.
