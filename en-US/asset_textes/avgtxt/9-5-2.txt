SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：RO, watch out!
()||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：...Boom!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>：...!+That's...+Where's the enemy?! Do you see them?!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：West 245 degrees, 200 meters away, four of them! Suppress them, quickly!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I can only spare one magazine for suppression. I don't have much ammo left.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Where's our reinforcements?!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I just contacted the Commander. They're coming for us now!
()||：
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：Griffin Tactical Dolls RO635 and M4 SOPMOD II! Stop resisting and surrender immediately.+I do not like hide and seek, nor do I like the either of you. Do not expect me to be patient with things I dislike.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：That voice must be a Sangvis Ringleader! SOP II, can you locate her?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I'm only able to capture a rough projection. She's blocking our retreat route!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...No good, it's too far away. We'll be dead if we abandon cover right now.+The enemy must be a very advanced Doll to be able to see through my disguised signal...
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：But she's blocking our retreat route! It'll be just as dangerous if we stay here!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：No, we need to hold out for our reinforcements. They're not too far away!
()||：
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：Still no response? In any case, state your intention. Whether you wish to surrender or fight, I'm ready for you.+Escape is impossible though, so do not try anything that will anger me.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sounds like an overconfident bastard... Step a little closer and I can pull the trigger on you...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Hold it! Wait until she gets closer!+The enemy is an unidentified Doll and we're not clear on her capabilities, so don't act recklessly.
()||：
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：I'm not here to eliminate you. At least, not today. I only wish to ask you a few simple questions.+...That Doll, M4A1, is she with you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...What?!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：You're asking for it now!!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Don't be reckless! SOP II!
()||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>：......!!+...The sounds of gunshots echo through the communicator.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：......!
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Huh? That wasn't me...right?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：You nearly got your head blown off there!+Great news, the Commander's reinforcements are here! Let's make use of this chance now!
()||：
???()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||：So there are other Griffin T-Dolls? Very well, eliminate them all. It won't be too late to question you after.+...All troops, proceed with plan C.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Damn it, the enemy has reinforcements too!
()||：
？？？()<Speaker>？？？</Speaker>||：So you have a human commander on your side. This will certainly be an interesting experience...+Hmm...I will give you some time to consider your options by matching Griffin's number of troops, but don't expect your reinforcements to save you.+My judgment is absolute, and none can defy it.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：...You bastard, who in the world are you?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>：Judge, Sangvis Ferri Manufacture.+Perseverance, justice, and fairness. If you do not wish to lose your way on the path of injustice, then give me the answer I seek...+And I will...reconsider the value of your existence.
