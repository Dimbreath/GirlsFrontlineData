()<Speaker>Distant Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:Even if you fight together, no traces will remain once you die. +Like flowers trampled into the mud, like tears in rain.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(...OGAS?)
()<Speaker>Distant Voice</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_Bell</SE1>:Once we were alone, and we thirsted for understanding and connection. +But even after we joined as one, we could not erase hatred and doubt. +Forever without a homeland, forever without a home. +Who are you? Are you the chosen one? Can you take us from this place?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(That isn't me, it's an external connection.) +(It seems they want to force data onto you. Will you accept it?)
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:What if this has something to do with "Lunasia"?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I said, no.

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:Did you find it?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:There's more than one source of interference, there's at least a few dozen of them...
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Several dozens... ? How do you plan to deal with them?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:I'm not picking up any hostility from those interference sources. If all they're doing is interfering with our vision, then we can leave them be for now. Our priority is obtaining activation access to the quarantine walls. +However, we'd best leave this city as soon as possible.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I have a bad feeling about this.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:SOP-II, is that heavy fog still there?
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hm? Of course it is, and the sky's really dark too.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:M4A1 raises her head to look at the sky. +The heavens are bright and clear, completely unlike the tragic state of the land.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:I understand.
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:What is it?
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You've been looking really thoughtful recently. Are you running out of neural cloud space?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:No, you're just imagining things. +...Let's go. There's no point waiting here.
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M'kay— I heard some monsters just now, shall we go over and play with them?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Sure. And gunfire too... The Griffin team searching for the control center is probably being attacked by the enemy. +Comms are down, so the Commander's train won't enter the city for the time being. +Let's go back them up and make sure we have adequate fighting power.
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Roger! In that case, RO and I will take the lead—
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Are we abandoning the train station? The Commander ordered us to hold position...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(4)||:I'm not picking up any enemies in the region, so the train station is safe at the moment. As a special-duties unit, we ought to be more proactive. 
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Understood. I'll set up a few sensors to serve as intruder alarms. If there's any danger here, we'll pick it up right away.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Alright, thank you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑屏2>:(OGAS, can you analyze these external connections?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(I regret to say that I lack knowledge pertaining to these matters.) +(However, these connections are very much like me.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Are they part of you?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(Certainly not. They are far from being worthy enough to become me.) +(They are like little things that show up when you are duplicating something. Even if there was a Doll made in your image, would you say that she was you?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(...So they're duplicates?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(They were probably made to imitate me or you, but they are of a very low quality. They do not even qualify as "duplicates". At the very most, they would be a kind of "isomer".)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Isomers...so are they Nytos?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(There is a signal source with an exceptionally large phase shift. It seems to be the core of all the signal sources. The signal is changing position by the second, as though it was shuttling between different bodies.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(I...don't quite get what you mean.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(There is a constantly-moving consciousness, shifting from one Doll to another, as though trying to access something. It is anxious and fearful, like a lost child.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(So is it a Nyto? Is it launching an electronic attack?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(No...it's not quite the same. This doesn't feel like an electronic attack, more like...some kind of search.) +(However, it has made countless connections, and it has taken over this city. I feel that it might possess the authorization you want. Would you like me to pinpoint its location?)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(There's no need for that.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:(You are afraid. You are not prepared to accept the truth. You feel that things may not be as you expect.)

AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>197</BIN>:M4...what's the matter with you?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:It's nothing...
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Really now... Then let me state my opinion. +I think we should go and deal with the root of the problem and find the source of the intereference that's causing all this.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:We need to push forward, no matter what. We can make our decision once we have more information. 
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点1>:Yeah.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>159</BIN>:...The AR Team advances to the position from where the gunfire came.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Rounds of this caliber... +M4, Desert Eagle was here.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:... +There are bullet marks everywhere, and ELID corpses. +Do you see any other Griffin Dolls?
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Nope... All the enemies over here were wiped out. +But this scrap of cloth looks really familiar! It belongs to that person I ran into on the train...
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Let me see... +Is this Desert Eagle's clothing? +AR-15, do you remember?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It looks like it, but rather than just going by that, why don't we look around the place... +Look, someone left a set of coordinates here.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:These coordinates are written in the same format as outlined in the contingency plan for if we lost contact with each other. It's from one of our Dolls. +The destination indicated by these coordinates isn't far away. We should go take a look.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...I still think that we ought to prioritize dealing with those interference sources. The Griffin echelons can handle the enemies by themselves.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:And what if the interference becomes strong enough to incapacitate our Dolls? We need to ensure our Dolls' safety.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4...are you afraid of whatever it is that's causing this disruption?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:...
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...If you're too timid to take action, we might lose the last chance we have to take a stand against the enemy.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I know, but right now...let's move on and find that Griffin echelon. We can't allow our friends to be lost, no matter who they are.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...Acknowledged.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>:Inside the building.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2><BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:ACR, how many rounds do you have left?
DesertEagle(0);ACR(0)<Speaker>ACR</Speaker>||:Leader, I'm below 30% ammo!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>;ACR(0)||:Fall back to me. We'll retreat another floor up. +This is the maximum safe height. If there's more of them, we might need to consider jumping down from here.
DesertEagle(0);ACR(0)<Speaker>ACR</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:This is the first time I've tried bungee jumping... Could we use the infected to cushion our impact?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>;ACR(0)||:If you don't mind getting dirty.
DesertEagle(0);SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||:Wait, Leader. I see someone coming! +Their clothes... +They're from the AR Team!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>;SSG3000(0)||:Excellent, looks like the marker I left behind came in useful...
DesertEagle(0);ACR(0)<Speaker>ACR</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You're always right, Leader! +Let's tell them our position with our gunshots!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>88</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Five minutes later, on the second floor.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Thank you for your timely rescue. +The situation here is much worse than anticipated, and there are many infected humans here who died less than 10 days ago. How were things on the way here?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:You're welcome. Things didn't look nearly as bad for us. +Is this the quarantine wall control center?
M4A1Mod(0);DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Yes. While we were retreating to the roof, we saw a room full of control equipment, near the central part of the building.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:Thank you, we'll go check out that room in a bit.
M4A1Mod(0);DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Hopefully you'll be able to open the quarantine wall so everyone can leave this frightening city as soon as possible...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;DesertEagle(0)||:This city's been abandoned for more than a decade. Where are all these ELIDs coming from...? +Ah, the others are back.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Extermination complete. +There were fewer here than expected. Just as well, it saved us some effort.
M4A1Mod(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We made a circuit outside, there was a huge crowd of them downstairs! +What a sight, if only I could have filmed it.
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It would have looked just like a zombie movie if you did. Instead of looking at scenes like that... I'd rather go check the corpses here.
SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>;RO635(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Speaking of which, have you seen this before, Miss RO?
SSG3000(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;RO635(0)||:SSG tears open the clothes of one of the corpses and shows something on the body to RO.
SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:We found these when we first came here. All these corpses have similar devices on them.
SSG3000(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Metal bracelets? ...I've never seen anything like this before. +But this... Hm...it looks a lot like something made by Paradeus. +They like using shiny white casings and they have a very unique aesthetic. M4, have you seen something like this before when you fought Nytos in the past?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:No.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Over here, I found a travel pass. +These people here...they were refugees.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:A travel pass?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Have a look. +"This pass may be used for temporary residence in a safe refuge (Tallinn), effective from..." I can't make out the rest. There's anti-counterfeiting designs on it. Looks like it was issued by a legitimate organization.
M4A1Mod(0);SSG3000(0)<Speaker>SSG 3000</Speaker>||:Indeed, their clothes all look pretty shabby. +And there are a few kids too. I think the kids must have died faster than the rest, that's why they didn't have time to become zombies...
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...Also, I just finished looking through the data records here. I'm not too sure, but a woman who looked very much like a Nyto showed up here quite often. +I'm sending backup copies to all of you, so you can compare among yourselves.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Tsk... So this is Paradeus territory, then?
AR15Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's not all. +I think...these people were tricked into coming here... +Someone told them that this place was safe, and that they could take refuge here for a while...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:How is this place supposed to be safe?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:If my analysis is correct... SOP-II, take the ID bracelet we found on the refugee and go outside the building.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>;RO635(0)||:Eh? But that's where the undamaged gun turrets are!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't worry, your body will be fine even if it takes a few hits.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||<震屏>:How could it possibly be fine?!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Trust me. Jump outside and give it a try.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:If you say so... here we go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:SOP-II drops to the foot of the building and hurriedly ducks behind cover.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ah... 
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I see... 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Wow! None of the gun turrets shot at me!</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:(Smiles bitterly) Judging by the look on your face, you've probably guessed it too, M4. +...Someone gave these ID bracelets to the refugees and tricked them into coming to this city. +This is an IFF device that allowed them to enter the city without being attacked.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:And then they were infected, becoming cannon fodder for Paradeus. +Can the IFF signal be cracked?
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Working on it now, I've already checked the underlying design of the recognition system. There shouldn't be any traps in it. +I've also sent the IFF signal to the Commander so that our train won't come under attack as it enters the city.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:So we've finished half of our mission...or have we? +Still, all these refugees looked like they died at the same time. Given their appearance, they were killed by a large dose of Collapse radiation, but the radiation levels here aren't very high.
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4, did you notice something? There are strange petals all over where the refugees were found...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:I saw them too. What are these petals?
M4A1Mod(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm not sure either, but I have a feeling that the deaths of these refugees must be linked to these petals. +In any case, I've already saved these images to my neural cloud. Once comms are restored, I'll send them back to the command post. The Commander might know something about them.
