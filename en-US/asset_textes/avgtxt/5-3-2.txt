AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Quiet. Watch your surroundings.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:No abnormal signals detected. All clear.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Humph. Judging by the tracks on the floor, the Ringleader gave us the slip only just now.

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||:Destroyer, Sangvis Ferri Manufacture.+Nice to see you, I guess? Even though it's only a call.+Still, I must say I was taken aback by how fast you move.+I was going to take my plan further here while things are a mess for you. I certainly didn't expect you to discover my coordinates.+This human named Kryuger is quick on his feet.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Griffin is on full alert now. You can no longer acquire any intel from us.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Humph, really? That doesn't really matter to me.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You guys...are after something else?
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You can't figure it out with your wooden brains, dumbass Griffin T-Dolls.+Just you watch. You won't be able to do a thing.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:She left the channel. Can you trace her signal?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16(3)||:Barely, but there are a lot of encrypted data that cannot be cracked right away.
M4A1(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Good thing she's still close. That idiot doesn't know we're actually tracing her.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||:Let's retreat first. We need to head back to HQ and report this ASAP.
AR15(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:AR-15...You seem pretty fired up about this mission.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<黑屏1>:Tch. I've always been a pragmatist. Any problem with that?+Let's get going. We don't have much time.
