M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Ahahahahaha! We're here! +Are you ready, you Manhattan bitches?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Your entrance makes you look like some kind of villain...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Hehe, games without villains are boring! ♪
()||:A pair of petite figures follow closely behind and climb onto the car as well, with some effort.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Stop! Your lines! Why are you going off the script again?! +While I know the two of you don't have much in the way of neural cloud capacity, don't you think yours is ridiculously low? +It's just a few lines and we've rehearsed them so many times, so why can't you remember them?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:That's not it, Boss. It's just that the lines you came up with were super embarrassing...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Don't worry about it, let's skip the entrance scene and begin our invasion of Manhattan!
()||:The Dolls look in the direction where ART556 is pointing. Before them stands Underground Parking Garage No. 560, from early 21st century. 
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Huh, so this is a parking garage from 50 years ago? +Looks just like Griffin's underground warehouse...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:How should I put this... It's got a very historical feeling to it...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Quit being picky, ladies. Do you know how many years you'd have to work just to afford a lot in a place like this?
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Why would anyone want to buy a space in a shoddy place like this?!
M870P(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Boss M870, this game's been around for a long time, are you sure there'll be other players?

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Hehe, I had a bunch of plans earlier, but I abandoned them and came here just for this. +It's all so I can enjoy being a Manhattan cop!
ART556(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:We get to mess around while pretending to be part of the Manhattan PD! ♪ +But are we seriously not going to consider fighting for the prize?
ART556(0);M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:What do you mean "pretending"? Mind your language! Being able to get the prize money is good, but our main goal here is having fun! ♪ +Besides, you'll have fine money coming out of your ears as long as you hang with me! Hehehehe...

ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Hehehehe...

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Fate? If I hadn't pulled you two in here, you'd probably be splashing around in a mud puddle somewhere.

M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Thank you, Boss M870. In order to celebrate our encounter, I'm going to share some food I just found with everyone!

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Awesome!

P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Aw, why so stiff? We're all from the same team, aren't we...?
()||:ART556 tries to jump off the car roof and flee, but P7 has a death grip on her. +ART556 tries to hide her remote control with one hand and deal with P7's tugging with the other, and the struggle soon grows heated.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:P7! It isn't much, so stay here and keep the Boss company!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Nonsense! It's dangerous to go alone...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:The hell are you two doing? Indulging in sisterly kinship in front of me?
()||:Trapped between the two of them, M870 separates the pair impatiently. +During the course of the struggle, ART556's remote lands on the roof of the car. +The air grows still in an instant.

M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:The heck is this?
()||:Before M870 can finish speaking, P7 and ART556 are already lunging for the remote control. +Bonk— That's the sound of two foreheads colliding.
()||<SE1>AVG_lifttable</SE1>:Shortly after that, the three Dolls end up locked in a big ball and roll off the car roof.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Uwah—
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Owowowow...

VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...You won another free bottle?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:No! Look over there, at AK-47...
()||:VSK-94 looks over at AK-47, not understanding what's going on.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:According to the map, if we want to go to the Dark Zone, we'll have to go...
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:It's still so far off?! You're planning to have your trump card here walk all this way to get to the battlefield?!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:THAT'S the entire length of Manhattan Island! THIS is where we...
()||:AK-47 and SKS are feuding about the route they're going to take.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:So what's the problem?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Look closely at AK-47's hand...
()||:VSK-94 focuses her attention on the finger that AK-47 is resting on the map.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Given our progress so far, I estimate we'll take another 8 hours to get there.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:...Then we'll have to pick up the pace! +Otherwise, the others will have the upper hand by the time we get there!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Da! A-91, VSK-94, we're going to pick up the pace!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Alright, no problem.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Comrades! Onward, to victory!

SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Eh, the beer here is really watered down.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Do you see it?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:You're not trying to tell me...that AK-47 has extra fingers...are you?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Nononono, AK-47 is MISSING fingers! +She only has five fingers on her hand! But look at me, I have eight fingers on mine!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
()||:Through her fingers, VSK-94 can see SKS wobbling over towards them.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Advance! Advance! Advance toward the objective! +Huh? How come you guys are ahead of me?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...+You were going the wrong way.
()||<黑点1>:VSK-94 sighs heavily and drags SKS and A-91 along in an effort to catch up with AK-47.
()||<黑点2>:...AK-47 suddenly comes to a halt outside the parking garage.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hehe, this is it, Underground Parking Garage No. 560.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Woohoo!
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:We can ride in a car?!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:If we can find a car, it'll greatly cut down the amount of time we spend on the road!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I should point out that we haven't been able to drive any of the vehicles we've encountered so far.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Aw, don't just give up, you've gotta keep trying! +Who knows, we might find a glorious steed for ourselves in there!
()||:VSK-94 peers into the gloomy entrance of the parking garage, then looks around again at her hyped-up teammates. +Her high-speed neural cloud proceeds to envision countless scenarios where the group is wiped out, and VSK-94 sighs heavily.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Let me do the scouting. +Given our present condition, we probably won't be able to make it into the garage alive.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:It'll be fine! Look, it's all quiet down there. +If you're worried, I'll chuck a bottle in and see if anything happens.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I don't think such a simple and crude method is suitable in this scenario...
()||:AK-47 walks up to the slope leading to the garage entrance and rolls the bottle she just finished down the incline.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:See! There's noth—
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM— +AK-47 is interrupted by a sudden explosion at extremely close range.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:How many times do I have to tell you, AK-47?! +Don't go throwing your vodka bottles around!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:It was a soda bottle..
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hehe, the enemy's pretty lively! +Looks like the battle's gotten very tricky. Make way and let me at 'em!
()||:A-91 takes out her knife and points it at the darkness below.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You lot! Get out here right now!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's A-91 for you! Spirited as ever!
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Get them, A-91!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Senior! You're holding your scout firing knife the wrong way round! If you open fire like this...
()||:VSK-94 immediately moves up to stop A-91, in the hopes of helping her correct her shooting posture.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:The NRS-2 should be held with the blade towards yourself...
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...What NRS?
()||:A-91 starts struggling as she sees VSK-94 trying to take away the knife in her hand.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hey, rookie, it's really dangerous to get close to A-91 when she's fighting!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:What are you two grabbing each other for?! +What if the enemies down there open fire on you while you're like this?
()||:AK-47 and SKS insert themselves into the battle for A-91's knife.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You-you think you can bully me just  because there's eight of you?!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:What do you mean, "eight of you"? In any case, just let go!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Why are you grabbing my hand so hard?!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Just let me handle it! Stop getting in the way!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You think you can take my knife because you've got numbers on your side? +I've got a few more Molotov cocktails in reserve!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...What?!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:You mean your empty vodka bottles? I tossed them long ago!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Blyat! Why do you keep throwing my bottles away, SKS?!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:That's because AK-47 loves throwing them around and causing trouble!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:What does this have to do with me?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, AK-47, what happened to that bottle you finished just now?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:It's over here...huh?
()||:As AK-47 looks down to search for the bottle, A-91 pushes away the Dolls around her with a forceful shove. +In the moment that she is pushed clear, SKS notices several bottles rolling down the slope towards A-91's feet...
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Aha, my bottles!
()||<黑屏1>:A-91 shakily lifts a foot...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:...After a tremendous explosion, the three Dolls lie dazed on the ground.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:...+Who did that?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:It was ART556!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Was it you?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Uh...
()||:M870 stands up, towering over ART556. +ART556 can sense incredible murderous intent overflowing from her eyes.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Boss, please, I can explain...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Explain what?! How am I supposed to enforce the law when my HP's dropped this low?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Don't get mad, Boss! There's bound to be a weaker team out there...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:In our current state? Maybe if we ran into a team that was sloshed out of their neural clouds! +Or else—
()||:Rattle rattle rattle— +A lonely soda bottle rolls down. +M870 immediately shushes herself and takes cover with P7 and ART556 behind a car.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:W-what now?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Shh— Someone's coming.
()||:The three Dolls turn their eyes toward the entrance of the parking garage and watch intently, but nothing happens...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Maybe you were hearing things?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Did the explosion damage your hearing modules?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Wait—
()||<黑点2>:More time passes.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:The lifespan of my kneecaps is dropping...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Can we go now, Boss?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Wait a little longer...
()||:...An ominous voice drifts in from the entrance of the parking garage.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Wooooooooooo—
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha the whole world's spinning!
()||:Before Squad M870 recovers from their shock, they see a huge indistinct ball roll into the parking garage...
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What on earth is that?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Looks like a bunch of boozehounds. No, wait, does this world have alcohol?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Do alcoholics need alcohol? They'll get drunk off a pint of plain water.  +Look at that lot, they're happily downing bottles of soda, as though they were actually drinking beer or something.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Hehe, looks like a bunch of marks have offered themselves up to us!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Wait a second, who's that Doll over there? Don't think I've seen her before...
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:VSK-94? I think she's new at the base. +So she ended up teaming up with them...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:She looks really strong, and she's clear-headed too.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:You think we can win, Boss?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Maybe if it were just those three drunks...
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Don't worry. Once we get VSK into our team, we'll be able to go even wilder, hahaha!！
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Speaking of which, I just remembered something...
()||<黑点2>:...On the other side of the parking garage, several Dolls awkwardly stagger to their feet.
A91(1)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You...what the hell's your problem? +Why'd you have to take my...my knifey?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...Your knifey?
()||:VSK-94 grabs A-91's hand and looks carefully at it. +It looks a lot like an NRS-2 shooting knife, but turns out it's just an ordinary knife.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:...Hahaha! How do you like it, rookie? +Life is always filled with surprises when you follow our squad, don't you think?!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:... +Heart attacks, more like...
()||:After recalling the blast from just now, VSK-94 warily observes the parking garage, looking for places where enemies might be lying in ambush.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Relax. If there were enemies around, they'd have opened fire already.
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:The hell are you acting so calm for, AK-47?! +How many times have I told you! Don't throw your empty bottles around!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:...SKS? Why are you grabbing my collar?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Haha, sorry, I'll be more careful next time. +Come, a toast to reaching the garage safely!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:We're way behind schedule as it is. Are you really going to keep drinking?
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:That's the vodka spirit! +If you don't get it, have a drink to clear your head!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Look, rookie, drinking is how we strengthen our bond and build rapport. +You should drink too, so you can bond with us faster! +I'm out, A-91! Give the rookie a bottle!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Huh? My vodka...?
()||:A-91 rummages through her bag. VSK-94 can clearly see her rummaging through several bottles of soda, but in the end she decides to zip the bag up.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Too bad, I'm out of vodka too...
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:I'm on my last bottle myself.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Then maybe I should scout ahead!
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Looks like we have no choice.
()||:VSK-94 quickly packs her things and leaves the parking garage.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Come come come, our squad's made it this far. This calls for a celebration!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:A toast to our upcoming victory!
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Drink! All of you, drink! We're not stopping till we're all smashed!
()||:M870 watches as the three Dolls tilt their heads back to down an entire bottle of soda each.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha! I'll go see if I can start up that car over there... (hic)
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Pick a spacious one... +That way we won't be knocked around inside when we're giving the cops the slip.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:There's no point. You'll hit your head on everything as long as AK-47's driving.
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Shaddup, you lot! If Kalina finds out we've been driving drunk again— +Wait a  minute, we're not in Griffin now, hehehe...
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hehe, now the Commander and Kalina can't nag us anymore!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You cowards, so you didn't dare drink because of a tiny problem like that?
AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Yeah, right. In any case, I've never been scared before... +Anyway, they'll just check me into rehab again if they catch me...
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:They just lock you in a pitch black room for several days and play traffic safety rules over and over again, without a drop of liquor in sight!+I'm Griffin's trump card, you know! How could I be scared of petty things like that?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Da, da...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As they recall their painful memories, the smiles on the three Dolls' faces grow stiff.+Just then, a righteous cry thunders through the air, accompanied by a powerful searchlight beam.

AK47(2)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:Pizdets! I can't help myself!
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:When I hear the word "police", I have the urge to run away!

()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As they see the look of helplessness on VSK-94's face, M870 signals P7 and ART556.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene1</BGM>:I'm Officer M870 of the Manhattan District Police, and these two are my deputies, ART556 and P7.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hello, Ma'am. I'm P7.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:And I'm ART556, at your service.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...You're Griffin Dolls too, right? +Why call yourselves the Manhattan P.D.?
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:That's because it's our mission, and since we've accepted it, we'll see it through to the end. +Granted, Manhattan's a wasteland now, but we still need to step up to protect the peace.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Yep!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Exactly!
()||:VSK-94 notices that the three Dolls are covered in wounds.
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Oh, our injuries? We got caught in an explosion when we were trying to stop those drunks.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:...Yeah, huh?+<size=25>Wait, is that part of our story now?</size>
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:<size=25>It's called improvisation, just roll with it!</size>
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Thank you for your hard work.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Well, we're low on people, and my deputies here aren't too experienced either... (Sighs)
M870P(4);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Manhattan's so big, so why are there only the three of you? +Are all the other cops gone...?
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Yep. I mean, you must have seen the state of Manhattan on the way here, right?
M870P(4);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Yes, it's quite a mess...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:We've been trying to recruit comrades while protecting justice, but the results haven't exactly been ideal.
M870P(4);VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;VSK(0)||:Well, that's enough about us.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Ma'am, your friends are gone. What do you plan to do now?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:I...
()||:ART556 and P7 innocently sidle up to her, and as she looks into their clear, shiny eyes, VSK-94 is reminded of the cloudy, inebriated eyes of those boozehounds...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Honestly, this is the first time I've seen perps who were so quick to abandon a friend. Still, it's alright, our job is to help the troubled masses. +If you're worried about running into danger on your trip, we can escort you.
P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:To serve and protect!
ART556(6)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>35,30</Position>||:Is our honor!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:No need for that... +I'd rather help you protect justice than help those alcoholics scrounge up more money to buy vodka.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. Do you mean...?
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:My name is VSK-94, and I once served with the police. I believe my experience should be of use. +Therefore, I hope you'll let me join you.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Why certainly! We'd be happy to have you with us!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Then I'll be in your care from now on.
P7(6)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Position>0,70</Position>||:Oh yeah!
ART556(6)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>35,30</Position>||:That's wonderful!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Welcome, I know you'll be able to bring new strength to the Manhattan P.D.!
VSK(0)<Speaker>VSK-94</Speaker>||:Right.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:VSK-94 packs her things and sets off. +Behind her, three pairs of Doll eyes gleam nefariously in the darkness of the parking garage.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hehe, we did it.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:All too easy!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Another flawless plan from the Boss!
()||<黑屏2><回忆><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:...10+ minutes ago.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Now that you mention it, I remember something...
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:What is it?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;ART556(0)||:I once saw several police officers come to the base to look for the Commander. The Commander looked really stern, so I decided to listen in.+I think AK-47 and her fellow drunks were speeding and ended up being arrested and dragged back to the base by the cops. +Kalina had to pay a huge fine and the Commander was super mad, and AK-47 and the others were severely punished!
P7(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:So you're saying they're afraid of the police...
P7(0);M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha, what dorks! +Still, we might be able to use this against those three drunkards. +The problem is, I haven't figured out VSK yet. I don't know what kind of strategy would be good against her.
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:You mean the three of us together can't beat her?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>);ART556(0)||:You have the cheek to bring that up? Would we even need to hide here if you hadn't blasted off most of our HP?!
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:(Sniffles) I already said I was sorry!
M870P(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Boss, look! VSK's gone!
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:Should we make our move now?
M870P(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What if VSK suddenly comes back?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;P7(0)||:Heheh, I have a plan.
M870P(0);ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:What is it?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;ART556(0)||:We'll go out now and arrest them for drunk driving. +That way we'll be on the side of justice, representing justice punishing the guilty!
M870P(0);P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Won't VSK try to save her teammates?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>;P7(0)||:When she returns, she'll find us bravely enforcing justice.
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:From what I know of VSK's background, she'll never oppose justice!
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:So you're saying... We pretend to be the law to recruit VSK?
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:You take that back! +From now on, we ARE the law! +Got that?
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker>||:No problem!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Perfect!
M870P(0)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, now let's do it! +You lot! Hands in the air!
()||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>8</BIN>:...In Kalina's livestream room. +Kalina has her eyes clenched tight in anguish, while her fingers are rubbing her temples over and over again.
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Don't make me recall those painful memories again! +(Sobs) We had to pay so much in fines back then!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Forget it, Kalin. It's been so long.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But whenever I remember paying off that fine, and seeing that huge sum leave my account... +It makes my heart ache!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then you should look at the betting pool. Feel better now?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Waha! Hehehehe...
()||:The tempting figures immediately boil away the tears brimming in the corners of Kalina's eyes.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright! Let's continue the stream! +All you Dolls watching the livestream, two teams have just undergone a huge member change! +VSK-94, formerly of Squad AK-47, has now been coaxed into joining Squad M870! +How much further will Squad AK-47 be able to go after losing one of their star players? And will Squad M870 gain a new lease of life? +Don't leave now, folks! Let's keep watching the progress of the game!
