SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:How did you know we're right next to their powder keg storage, Makarov?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I found out when I was searching for Nagant's warehouse.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:You've thought of everything, haven't you. As expected of the one who's earned even Mosin-Nagant's trust.
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:Hey, Makarov only got the chance because I'd forgotten where the warehouse was! It's all thanks to me!
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:It all started because of you... By the way, what's that thing you're clutching?
M1895(1)<Speaker>M1895</Speaker>||:No idea. It has Griffin's logo on it so I just took it with me.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...+Enough chit-chat. We're not completely out of danger yet.+Commander, are you there? We can't go back the way we came.+Please lead us away from the battlefield.
