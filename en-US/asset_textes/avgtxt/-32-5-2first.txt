IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:We actually did it, we avoided over a hundred S.F.! +Miss Stella's going to praise us heaps for this!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Don't celebrate too soon, the mission's only just begun.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Yup yup, look, it's the Earth Computer!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:We're here at last... +So this is...the massive computer that controls the entire planet...
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:It's so big... +But we're very lucky, being that there aren't even any guards inside. Huh...we lost contact with Miss Alma!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:The Computer's structure is very intricate, so the room is completely sealed off from outside signals to protect against interference.+Fortunately, we can still use closed-circuit signals in here, but it'll be just the two of us from here on out.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:The Computer's control console should be in the center of the interior. Let's climb inside and see what's going on!

IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Nya? What's that?
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:It's the external control console for the Earth Computer. It controls the emergency defense system for the Computer and its room. +We need someone to stay outside to operate it in case S.F. barges in or if something else happens.
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:I think you're better suited for that. I'm the sort of person who screams whenever anything happens...
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Yes, I'm worried about your carelessness too... +So you'll go into the Computer?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>;SuperShorty(0)||:Leave it to me! I'm great at climbing!
IDW(0);SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Alright, IDW. I'll activate the defense system, but I won't be able to see you once you go in there, so be careful.

BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Nice to meet you. My name is Elisa, an avatar of the Earth Computer's AI. +You may enter commands into the Earth Computer through Elisa.+Elisa is very happy to see you. Is there anything I can help you with?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:I...I... What should I ask, Leader?

BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Wow, that was a really forward way of putting it...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:...Sangvis Ferri was created because someone gave the order to Elisa.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:...An order?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Yes, her order was...

BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:What kind of order is that!? And you actually carried it out?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:There was no problem in comprehending the order. +It supplied an objective, a reason, and a concrete course of action to follow. +Elisa then drew up the most efficient action plan in accordance with the order. +Elisa used scrap metal to secretly produce a large mass of S.F. Dolls and began to clean up all life on Earth.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Who gave that order? Please stop it right away!
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I apologize, but the order cannot be cancelled. +That is because the person who issued the order has superuser privilege over the Earth Computer.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:What? Who's got access like that?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Access forbidden. Elisa cannot answer you.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:But...S.F. alone can't beat the White Knights!
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Y-Yeah, do you really think your S.F. units alone could destroy this world?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:The current S.F. units are only for testing purposes. The testing has already yielded results.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Elisa has readjusted the plan and has begun to produce more powerful combat units.
()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>48</BIN><黑屏2>:What... +This... What IS this!?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:A Jupiter Cannon. It is capable of easily destroying all of Griffin City's defensive installations.
()<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>35</BIN><黑屏2>:And...what about these...
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Elite S.F. Dolls. Their performance far exceeds that of the test models. They will be responsible for carrying out massacres.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:And this one...
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:An experimental Doll. She possesses a perfected simulated personality. She can use deception to gain the trust of other intelligent lifeforms to harvest important intelligence.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Architect!? Oh no! I need to tell them! +Dammit, I can't wake up! Do I have to go through the entire memory first!?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:The designs for the above-mentioned units are already complete. It is estimated that they can enter production today.
