TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Lee... They've all calmed down.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Right, thanks.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:... +...Still, I can tell they're getting more and more anxious. +I just checked – the rain is also getting heavier. +We need to think of something.
()||:Lee Enfield remains silent and kneels down by the wall to get a closer look at PK's body.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Lee?
()||:Tokarev expresses her bewilderment, but Lee Enfield simply stands up again and observes her surroundings quietly.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Miss Lee?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Just call me Lee, Tokarev. +Do you remember how MDR was killed?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Uh...sure, Lee. +I do remember. Miss MDR's neural cloud crashed as she was attacked electronically in a completely sealed room.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:There's something I haven't been able to figure out. +Why did MDR enter that room in the first place? +And why would MDR, who specializes in electronic warfare, fall victim to an electronic attack herself?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Don't tell me even you believe it was a ghost.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It would be a relief if it really were a ghost. +No ghost can imagine what kind of hardships we've been through. +Sadly, I am 100% certain that we are not in a fantasy story, but a third-rate detective novel.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I don't understand. What do you mean? +We've already confirmed multiple times that there's no one else in the building. +If this is a third-rate detective novel, do you mean to say the culprit is among us? +But how is that possible?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The truth is often hidden in shadows where the light can't reach, Tokarev.+The only possible reason for MDR to be ambushed that way is because she trusted the culprit enough to turn her back. +I've found someone to be very suspicious for a while now. +Do you remember the scuffle we got into in the beginning? And what happened when we discovered MDR's body?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You mean...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Leader, how long are we supposed to wait?!
()||:Apart from the two team leaders, the remaining T-Dolls are starting to lose their cool. +The consecutive deaths of their friends have greatly infuriated them, but not being able to identify the murderer is also making them uneasy. +The ominous sense of impending doom spreads among them like a miasma. Everyone is waiting for things to blow up any second.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Type 56-1, Gr G36c, Papasha, Sten.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Yes, ma'am.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Let's start from the beginning. +After my last communication with Gr G36c, why did you leave your post, Sten?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:...I was wrong to do that, and I've already told you why I did it. +I found it impossible to be a sitting duck, and my anxiety got the better of me. +So I decided to walk it off and take a look around.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Gr G36c said PK went after you, but you never saw her, is that true?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Of course! I don't know what's going on, but I honestly didn't see her! +...Wait, the way you're questioning me... You think I did it?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Not at all. Lee is merely trying to sort out the facts.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:... +...I received your call not long after I left. +Just as I was trying to figure out who snitched on me, I heard Papasha's scream. My ears are still ringing a bit even now.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Papasha, when you and Type 56-1 discovered PK, was she already lying on the floor?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Papasha?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Oh! Uh...da. +Sorry...I'm still in shock... +Tovarisch 56-1 and I were conducting an outward search according to plan but didn't find anything remarkable, so we went back the way we came. +Then...then I saw PK collapsed right here.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What she said. +Sten got here soon, and then the two of you.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:...Well, Leader? +Who do you think is responsible for this – a ghost or one of us?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Don't make such nasty jokes... +I'd rather believe it's a ghost, to be honest. +No matter the circumstances, accusing someone of killing a fellow T-Doll is pretty serious, you know?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Papasha found PK and screamed. +Sten, who was not too far away, heard the scream and rushed to the scene. +Sten, did you hear anything odd?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Answer me first!
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Sten!
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:...No, I didn't! I didn't hear anything but the rain and the thunder!
()||:The mounting suspicion is causing the already heavy atmosphere to sour rapidly. + Tokarev glances again at Lee Enfield, who appears to be deep in thought. She has absolute faith in her, but given the circumstance, if Lee still can't think of a solution, things will soon go completely out of hand.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:MDR fell victim to an electronic assault, while PK was shot.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Hmm?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Multiple bullet wounds can be found on PK's body. +Her cause of death is most definitely a gunshot. +This is different than the case with MDR.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:...Now that you mention it, you're absolutely right. I was too overwhelmed to even consider that. +But what does it mean?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Everything happens for a reason, Tokarev. +Putting this together with my previous suspicions, I now have a general idea of what happened. +This is also why I said we're in nothing more than a third-rate detective novel. +A mysterious mansion, some terrifying rumors, a cliched thunderstorm... I have nothing against classics, but sometimes I wish authors can be just a little more original.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:You're speaking in a completely different tone. +Are you sure you have the answer?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't know what they say about me on the anonymous forum, but I'm not as simple as they think. +I do, in fact, have a rough understanding of the situation at hand. The culprit thinks they've already done a pretty good job, but we Griffin T-Dolls can do even better. +But I'm still missing one last piece of the puzzle. Would you help me, Tokarev?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Certainly. It would be my pleasure.
