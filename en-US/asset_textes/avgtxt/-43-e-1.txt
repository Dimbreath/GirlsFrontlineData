()||<BIN>301</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +0006 hours, Hudson Refugee Camp. +After Squad Vector arrives at the hiding spot.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...They didn't follow you?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:No... God, they're so annoying. +Why did we have to run into people like that right at the start of the game? +I can't believe those drunks logged on before even clearing their heads!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:A bad start is the end of a stretch of bad luck. +The real show starts now, don't you think?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Yep! We're due for a hot streak!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Being put on the back foot by bunch of newcomers also reflects our lack of preparation. +That was a mistake on my part, as team leader.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Haha, relax, Miss Vivi. +I'm sure the Commander wasn't out to give you so much pressure. You were assigned to do this because they trusted you.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I'm not going to second-guess the Commander's decision. I'll only end up being depressed whether I get it right or wrong. +Rather, it would be more useful to think about how to complete this mission.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:So it's a cost-effectiveness thing, then? +Also, why would getting it right make you sad? Wouldn't you be happy to guess correctly?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Usually, being able to anticipate what a superior is thinking might be a good thing.+But in some history books, there are examples of subordinates who were disliked for being too clever for their own good. +Kind of like that Chinese man who liked eating chicken ribs.+Also, what if the others started making jokes like "You got it right again? You must be really close to the Commander"?+I'm sure I'd want to die.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:That's a tough one... +Are you always like this around the Commander?
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Haha... Not all the time. Vivi's just weird that way. +If only she could alter that strange personality of hers a little. +So, what do you plan to do next?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Good point. Let's decide our future strategy. +AK-47 and company aside, it's plain to see that some of our best people are in this game. +Moving around carelessly on the battlefield is going to be suicidal.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Bingo~♪ +If we consider fighting prowess alone and forget about their wild ways... +Miss AK-47 and her bunch are incredibly strong. +And the same goes for the other Dolls.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That's true, but there's no need to sell yourselves short. +I believe that we're no less capable than they are. +As long as we're careful, finishing the mission won't be too difficult.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:I wonder what I should have the Commander buy for me after we win the prize!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Isn't it a bit early to be thinking about the prize? +We should focus on how to win first. +To be honest, I haven't quite figured out what's going on yet.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Well, thanks to Miss Dima's explanations... +I have a basic understanding of the mechanics of the game. +In any case, we need to stock up on supplies while engaging the enemy. +We need to preserve our strength before we enter the Dark Zone.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:What AK-47 and her people are doing is very unwise. +Being too engrossed in combat too soon will lead to falling behind and being overwhelmed due to a lack of supplies and provisions. +The basic problem is not spending time on gathering supplies, and it's compounded by heavy fighting depleting already-limited stocks of ammo.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:All in all, I'm not against fighting, and there's no need for us to keep avoiding combat. +However, we should avoid unnecessary fights. +I suggest we build up our supplies and proceed toward the Dark Zone at a steady pace.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:That's a wise choice.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Also...I have a proposition.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:A proposition?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I've noticed something. +The four of us moving together make for a large target.  +We'll be easily ambushed and finding supplies isn't too efficient that way.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Indeed. +Also, the enemy will be better able to focus their efforts if they have fewer targets to monitor, right?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Yes, indeed. +Therefore, R93...
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Ah? Yes?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I'm planning to split the squad into two. You and K5 will travel together, while PP-90 will go with me. +With Team A and Team B covering each other, we'll be able to use more agile tactical deployments to achieve victory.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Huh? So we're splitting up?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:What do you think, K5?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:I suppose this is fate guiding our way. +I have no objections, so let's watch each other's back, R93.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well... Alright, then.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:You picked me! I'm so happy, Vivi! Does it mean you have a special kind of trust in me?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Haha.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:What's with that forced laugh?! +My ego is super fragile, you know!
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:What about our route?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That's another reason why I suggested splitting up. +The supply caches on the map are limited. If we split up, we'll have a higher chance of finding more supplies. +It's safer than putting all our eggs in one basket... +Miss Dima?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, I'm here.</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Earlier, you said that the Dark Zone could be reached by passing through Lexington Avenue, right?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes. You need to find sufficient gas masks before the time limit and enter the Dark Zone.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Otherwise you'll be eliminated.</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:R93, your main job will be collecting resources in the vicinity of the Public Library. +PP-90 and I will set out from Sixth Avenue, head over to Times Square... Then we'll meet up at Lexington Avenue.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:OK.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Roger.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:If you understand, then let's set out now. +Supplies are limited, and the later you start, the less we'll get.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Right now? +But...this weather...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Not even the guidance of Venus can pierce such thick clouds. +Can't we rest up for a little longer?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:No. +We already logged in later than the others. +If we enter the Dark Zone without sufficient supplies, it'll essentially be a form of slow suicide. +Also, we're Dolls, not humans. +If we let something as insignificant as the weather hinder us, then what's the point of mankind making us? +Come on, pull yourselves together.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:(Sighs) Well, if you say so.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:It can't be helped, then. +Look forward to the haul we'll bring in.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Yeah. I'm counting on you.
()||:R93 stretches lazily and packs up with K5 in silent coordination. She exchanges one last look with Vector before walking into the snowstorm.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:It's not that bad yet, but you mustn't take things too lightly either. +After all, body temperature is a thing in the game. +Don't forget, people were actually eliminated because they froze to death.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That was "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch", right? ...I wonder what kind of a Doll she was.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Relax, relax, just pay attention and everything will be alright. +After all, even in reality, we have to make sure that the cold doesn't freeze our joints and gun barrels.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Anyway, we ought to set out too.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Woohoo!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Winter is coming... +I've always wanted to carry out a mission like this.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Also, isn't this America? +It's like we're on holiday!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Alright, enough nonsense. Let's go.
PP90(0)<Speaker>PP-90</Speaker>||:Okie!
()||<黑屏1>:After watching R93's team leave, Vector and PP-90 stride out into the snow as well.
