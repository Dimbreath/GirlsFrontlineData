SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>><黑屏2>:Shut up! You traitor! +You... +I won't... +I'll never...
()||:...SOP-II grits her teeth and cuts the transmission.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:Kill you... +Kill... all S.F... +No... +M4A1... +M4A1...where are you...
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What should I do...? +I can't...I can't believe M16 anymore... +I'm alone... +I have to...decide by myself...
()||<黑屏1>:...An hour later.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Bang! Bang, bang!
()||:...SOP-II takes the S.F. command post and goes into a rampage, wrecking everything.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Not enough... +Not enough...blood... +I haven't...found her yet...M4A1...isn't here... +I need to...carry on...
()||<SE2>Gunkill</SE2>:...Bang!
()||<黑屏1>:...SOP-II is shot in the back.
()||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏2>:...The alerted S.F. remnants gather around her, and in her impaired state SOP-II cannot respond in time. +She hears M16A1 say something over the comms channel, but none of that matters anymore.
()||:...SOP-II, ragged and all alone...can no longer move. +Night falls on her and this unfeeling world. She does not stand up again. She does not feel anything again. She no longer knows what is happening in the world. +Is this death? Is this the ending...and the answer that she sought? +SOP-II's neural cloud slowly sinks into endless confusion, until it is utterly devoured by the night.

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Stop. +Commander, SOP-II did not die. She is still alive. You are lying to us. +There is no point in doing so.
()||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><震屏>:...Smack!
()||:My eyes can't catch what she did, but my body knows.
()||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><震屏>:...Smack! Smack!
()||:Those aren't hands, but a pair of torture implements.
()||:There is no expression on the puppet's face after the punishment ends, neither enjoyment nor pity. +I grit my teeth. My entire body hurts, and I'm bleeding. +My face must look even uglier now, worse than after being caught in the blast of that dirty bomb...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:The interrogation continues. +Whenever you diverge from our information, we will consider more rigorous methods of interrogation in the future. +Commander, amend your story.
()||:I know, I know. +I cough up a wad of blood, which probably has a tooth in there as well. I pant heavily, and then I try to think through the pain... +It is time for another story, and I have to reconsider its...ending.
