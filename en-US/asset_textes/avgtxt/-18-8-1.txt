BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||:Ahh... +Where will they aim for next? +Those big bruisers really are going to level our home.
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Do you regret it?
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||:You mean, missing this performance? +I was going by the script. There's nothing to regret.
？？()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:But...you still want to go back, don't you?
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||:You're awfully chatty today, Scarecrow. +I went to a lot of trouble to wake you up, and it wasn't for you to annoy me.
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... +It's just that I'm not happy with this outcome.
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:It won't end like this... +That's why we have to survive. These are Agent's orders.
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:But Gager and the others...
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:That was their mission. +Being able to just die somewhere on the battlefield is a lot easier than what we have to do... +So, has everyone's route been arranged already?
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Yeah. +Except for Dreamer. Agent sent her somewhere else.
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:I know, that's another route. +Let's go while Griffin and the big bruisers from the human military haven't found this place yet.
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Are we really...just going to leave everything?
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:Griffin has their hands full defending their supply lines from the Military. They have no time to worry about us. +We're all the same now, all struggling to survive. +Or rather, we have always been the same, right from the very start...
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:So you do regret it after all?
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:No, I am just... +...pondering other possibilities.
BOSS-4(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:I don't understand.
()||:...Intruder pats Scarecrow on the head.
BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||<黑屏1>:That's why you're called Scarecrow. +Let's go, everyone's still waiting for us.

干扰者()<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:T-Dolls of Griffin. +What will our next encounter be like? +...I'm looking forward to it.
