M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Beautifully done, Boss. Now let me discuss our next step with the PIC of this mission.+1911, do you copy?
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker><通讯框>;M1928A1(0)||:You've come way ahead of time. Looks like the commander can't wait to see me.
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Oh, please. I need to put someone here. Any suggestions?
M1911(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:This base is used mainly for recon work. Best leave it to a handgun T-Doll.
M1911(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:A handgun, huh. Other than you, who else is up to the job...
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Let me do it, Miss Thompson! I'll do even better than 1911!
M9(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:That's some nice verve you've got there. Griffin needs enthusiastic T-Dolls like you.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Humph. I'll take every chance to prove that I'm better than a certain old hag!
M9(0)<Speaker>M1911</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:I heard that, M9...
M9(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Anyway, I'm leaving scouting duties to you, M9. Now, a T-Doll to guard you...
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:That won't be necessary. We're understaffed enough as it is, right?+I'll be fine on my own if it's just scouting. Don't underestimate my skill in making great escapes.
M9(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Don't try too hard to be brave, M9. The battlefield is unpredictable.
M9(0)<Speaker>M9</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:I've fought a bunch of Sangvis with the commander. Don't worry about me.
M9(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:All right. Be careful then. Let's keep going.
