()||<BGM>GF_xGS2_11</BGM><回忆>:It was one of my first recollections. +One day, Signore Giuseppe came into my room.
()||:He placed a camera on my desk. +He said it was a gift for me so that I could better observe the world. +I was very puzzled. As a Cyborg, isn't my only duty to fight well? +But if that was what Signore Giuseppe wanted me to do, I would do it. +And so I started documenting my life through the camera lens. It was Signore Giuseppe who made my life so bright and vibrant. +I'm a Cyborg and he's a Handler. Together we're Fratello. +He was the very first person I saw when I woke up. +In that moment I felt it, that he's my reason for living. +If I had to sacrifice my short life, it would be for the purpose of protecting him. +That had always been my unwavering conviction. +I had always thought that was how it would end.
()||:But in the end, I shot him. +I killed Signore Giuseppe. +I didn't protect anyone. +It was my fault that Signore Giuseppe and I lost everything. +It was my fault that he would never come back.
()||:I should have died, yet I woke up again, and everything repeated itself right from the start. +The same tragedy happened time and time again. Even though I knew what would happen next, there was nothing I could do to stop it. +Is this ending inevitable? +Day after day, I asked myself the same question. +Until one day, a voice told me...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:That's not true. There's something you can change.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Who are you?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I'm the administrator of this place.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Administrator?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I can't allow your memories to be washed away by time, but I can't bear to see you all living in a purgatory of endless repetition. +That's why I've rewritten your commands. If it's you, I'm sure you can find a way to save them all.
()||:That's all the voice had said, and that was the only time it had spoken to me. +But for some reason, I had a feeling it must've been Signore Giuseppe.
()||:Signore Giuseppe must have forgiven me and allowed me to leave this world of tragedy. +He must have forgiven me and is giving me a chance to apologize to him. +I left my Vita. The world outside is an incredibly beautiful garden. +I spend my days thinking while I wait. +As the seasons passed, the flowers in the garden bloomed and wilted, then bloomed again. +But no matter how long I waited, Signore Giuseppe never came. +In my boredom, I discovered that I could freely enter the others' Vitas. +But no one answered when I called out to them. The Cyborgs were all ensnared in their respective dreams. +They're forced to live in their own personal hell, yet I couldn't do anything; I couldn't get through to them in their own worlds. +All I could do was watch as they live through their stories again and again. +Have we all been forgotten?
()||:This idea suddenly occurred to me one day. +Why are we here? Why can we experience our past again and again? +As I solved these mysteries, I came to understand the nature of this world, and I realized that our world wouldn't last forever. +The edges of the world were starting to fray, and all I could do was slow down the deterioration for as much as I could. +Signore Giuseppe hadn't come back yet, so I must somehow keep it all in one piece until his return. +I figured out the operating principles of this world and thought of a way to save it, but I was too weak to do anything. +I failed to save Signore Giuseppe because I was weak. Is my weakness also going to stop me from protecting this world until Signore Giuseppe comes back?
()||:So I started looking for help. I prayed that someone would come and save us. If I could hold the world together for one more day, that's one more day Signore Giuseppe could come back and find us. +But my pleas went unanswered. More time had passed – it's been so long I've lost count of the years.
()||:Then one day, hope appeared out of nowhere. Somebody came to the garden. +I sensed that they possessed the power that could change the world and I hoped they could stay. However, they didn't belong here and I knew that I couldn't keep them here for long. +I begged them to stay in our Cyborgs' Vitas, hoping they could bring change to my friends' lives. +Meanwhile, I made use of their power to sustain this world.
()||:I know it was extremely selfish of me, but I couldn't just let the world crumble to dust. +Signore Giuseppe would surely forgive me for this, right?
()||:It's tiring work trying to restore this world. Even with the girls' power, every restoration attempt left me exhausted. +This was a different kind of torture. It must be my punishment for deceiving our guests. +But the progress of repairing the world was distressingly slow even with their help – the world was simply too old. +Has it really passed the point of no return? +I kept asking myself night after night. +Just as I was about to give up, Signore Giuseppe came.
()||:I tried my best to contain my excitement. I didn't want him to think I still couldn't control my emotions like the last time we saw each other. +Signore Giuseppe was as gentle as ever, but he seemed very preoccupied. +Has he come looking for our guests? +Why won't he look at me like he used to?
()||:But it didn't matter. Signore Giuseppe was back, and I couldn't care less about anything else. +However, he's been freeing the new girls out from the Vitas one after the other, and the power I could utilize decreased steadily. +When Signore Giuseppe frees everyone and brings them to the garden, I will no longer be able to fix the world. +But that's okay. If that's what he wants to do, I won't hesitate to help him. +Now that Signore Giuseppe is back, I already have half of my wish fulfilled. +Since he has already visited the other Cyborgs' Vitas, I bet he'll return to my world and see me again if I just leave him.

NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><关闭蒙版><BIN>262</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_15</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>That's everything from Henrietta's records.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Thank you. I have a rough idea of the whole picture.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So this space was created almost 60 years ago, and it is almost at its limit now.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Rather, it's practically a miracle that it's managed to keep operating for this long with no external maintenance.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The administrator altered Henrietta's authorization during their last login session, and she's been trying to maintain this space ever since.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Can you look up this administrator?</color>
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's been almost 60 years. I'm afraid this administrator has long since passed away...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I see...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So our Dolls ended up helping her keep the space operational.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>They each stayed in a Vita while the processing power of their neural clouds was utilized to reconstruct the base layer of the space.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, the space is simply too old and outdated, so it isn't altogether compatible with the operational framework on Level II. Even with the Dolls' computational capacity, it isn't possible to complete the reconstruction of the base layer within a short period of time.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Not to mention Henrietta isn't equipped with the technical know-how to formulate a reconstruction of that scale...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So that's why our Dolls went missing for so many days...</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Now that all our Dolls are back inside the garden, you can come out whenever you want.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Still, I gather our nosy and meddlesome Commander won't just leave them behind?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Obviously. In any case, we can't just abandon them.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, you know what to do right?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ugh... Alright, alright. But Miss Helian is definitely gonna chew my ear off for this...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry about that... But that's the price we have to pay.</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Easy for you to say.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You're not getting out of this, Commander! You're gonna suffer through the whole lecture with me! </color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well...I'd really rather not be subjected to a dressing-down by Miss Helian...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you save me from it, I'll do anything you want.</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You mean it?!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Anything at all?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uh... Hmm... Yes.</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That sounds rather forced...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But anyway, we have a deal!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I've started preparing for it even before you asked, but I need a bit more time.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I called up an engineer from HQ. He agreed to help in return for a photo of Miss Springfield.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It feels like we're selling Springfield out...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>He's not asking for anything weird, is he?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's just going to be a normal and casual photo. Miss Springfield has agreed to it too so you don't have to worry about that.</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>While we're working on this, please find Henrietta and bring her back, Commander.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>GF_xGS2_16</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, I just entered the last Vita.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Things look really bad in here...</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Be careful, Commander. This Vita is on the verge of collapse.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Do not fall into the data-less void.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you fall off, there's no coming back.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then how should I proceed towards the ending?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The ending doesn't matter anymore. The key is finding Henrietta.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I have already copied all the codes and data of this space into our own database, but she's the only one with full control access.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If we just confirm the transfer, the system will simply take the authorizations from her by force.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That will cause her to just disappear, so we must strip her of her authorizations before it comes to that.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What do I do after I find her?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You just have to stay with her while I overwrite her access codes remotely.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I see. Please be gentle.</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just worry about yourself. This Vita is full of enemies.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Hehehe, this equipment is connected to ALL your sensory input. It will hurt if you get hit. You'll be in for a hard time if you have the habit of relying too much on your Dolls~</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Can't you disable the pain perception mode?</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's the fun in that?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh...I see.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Thanks for the reminder... I'll be sure to request for more combat and physical training in the future.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>And you must attend with me. That's an order.</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What?!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Why do I have to go?!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Well, this is the last Vita; guess I'll just throw myself in.
()||<BIN>267</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_xGS2_36</BGM>:...
()||:It's a turbine hall.
()||:I walk on silently in the ruin. As mentioned in the file, this is the site of the New Turin Nuclear Power Plant, and I'm now inside the turbine hall.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:According to the data, Henrietta should be somewhere around here, but this place is empty. All I can hear is the sound of crossfire coming from the distance. +I check my weapon. It's a P90 with a 551. These are probably SS190 rounds in the semi-translucent magazine. +...That's going to be a problem. +Why would the Agency give me such a weapon? Even from a short distance, it'll be very difficult to pierce through the ceramic plates of fully-armed Five Republics soldiers with 5.7 projectiles. +I tug at the bulletproof vest on myself. It feels so strange to be wearing such old equipment. The IMTV seems kind of flimsy – not reassuring at all.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta, can you hear me? +Henrietta?
()||:I press on the radio again, but I'm getting no response in my earpiece.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:More gunshots come from the distance. If I remember correctly, the original squad from the Agency fought the Five Republics on the other end of the turbine hall. Henrietta must be there as well.
()||:I sprint in the direction of the gunfire. +It's a straight path leading to the other end of the turbine hall. The path is lined with half walls on both sides, which can be used as cover. +The hallway is already littered with corpses. An intense battle must've taken place here not long ago. +Two soldiers are checking the bodies on the ground. They must have heard my approach and are just about to turn, but I pull the trigger before they can react.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The spray of bullets from my sub-machine gun hit the first man in the head. His helmet deflects two rounds, but the third one gets through. +The other Five Republics soldier recovers quickly from the shock and starts running in the opposite direction, but is hit in the back by several rounds. +He lurches forward as if he's been pushed from behind, but the ceramic plates protected him and he finds his balance again almost instantly. +He dodges my remaining barrage and dives behind the half wall in the corner, then alerts his allies through his radio.
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:Another man from the Agency is here! +Requesting support! Get me backup!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Crap...!
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:I discard the empty P90 and draw my pistol as I break cover. +While the soldier is still busy with his radio, I shoot a few rounds into his head. +I get behind cover and pick up his assault rifle. I check how much ammo it's still got and take the rest of his magazines. +Meanwhile, strong flashlight beams are sweeping back and forth on the other end of the hallway – enemy reinforcements have arrived very quickly.
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:The Agency guy is over there. Fire!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I quickly kneel on one knee and duck back behind the wall. A second later, a hail of bullets come sweeping in my direction.
()||:While I'm forced to hide behind cover, they've already blocked off the exits. +I try to return fire, but the enemies are shooting at me from two different directions, giving me no opportunity at all.
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:We've got him pinned down! Prepare to close in!
()||:The enemies advance as they maintain suppressive fire against me. It's only a matter of time for them to get to my position. +I press myself to the ground and throw a grenade towards them, then put my assault rifle into fully automatic mode.
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:Watch out! Grenade!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:The soldiers already out in the open dart back into the corner at the sight of the grenade. +It goes off, filling the area with smoke and dust. I take the opportunity to break cover and fire at the enemies while I charge at the wall ahead of me. +A soldier on the left is about to shoot me after evading the grenade, but I manage to hit him in the torso. However, another soldier on the right also opens fire in my direction. Two rounds hit my body like a pair of heavy punches.
()||:I dive behind cover making use of the momentum, but as I feel around my abdomen, my hand comes away covered in blood.
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:Got him! Charge!
()||:I feel a sharp pain in my abdomen. I try to steady myself but I can't muster the strength to move my lower body. +The enemies are getting closer and closer. When they are just a few feet away from me—
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe!
()<Speaker>Five Republics Soldier</Speaker>||:Watch your back!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:All of a sudden Henrietta appears behind the Five Republics soldiers and leaps toward them. Before they can even turn around and take aim, she has already shot them squarely in the head. +Gotta hand it to the Agency – these Cyborgs' accuracy is almost as good as a T-Doll's. But if I had a Doll with me, I wouldn't have been hit at all. +For some reason, I'm suddenly very glad that I joined Griffin.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, are you hurt?!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I think so... It hurts a bit...
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Don't move! Let me take a look!
()||:I struggle to sit up against the wall and Henrietta inspects the spot where I've been hit.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Your vest blocked two rounds, but one got through into your abdomen... +There's an exit wound as well! I need to stop the bleeding first!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I knew this flimsy vest wouldn't do its job...
()||:Before Henrietta can even open her medkit, the wall next to us is already being sprayed by more bullets.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:The rest of the enemies are here!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Leave me for now and take care of them first!
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:But...!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We'll be dead if you let them get close! Return fire!
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Understood!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Henrietta darts behind the wall on the other side and opens fire on the enemies coming our way. +The two soldiers leading the way collapse immediately and the others scatter to seek cover.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Don't let them get within grenade range. +Save your ammo and fire in bursts.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Right!
()||:...Two tiny holes aren't going to kill me. I've been through worse. What's so scary about a few terrorists? I can keep going. +While Henrietta is buying me time, I roll back onto my knees and press a wad of bandages against my abdomen while ignoring the pain.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:I then wrap more bandages tightly around my torso and give myself a quick shot of morphine. After that, I toss my empty magazine and look for replacements - only two mags left. +I drag myself up while leaning against the wall. Using it as support, I join Henrietta in holding off the enemies.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, I've found Henrietta! How much time do you need?!</color>
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We'll be ready soon! Please hang in there for just a little longer!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I hope she really means "just a little longer"...
