PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><通讯框>||:Silence everywhere. Sangvis Ferri haven't made their move yet.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:They're running tests on some sort of artillery weapon with this city.+The attack wasn't directed at us, so the possibility of 92 and co.'s survival is very high.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Oh? How do you know?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Someone's looking into it. I got word just now.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Just now? After you cried into my shoulder?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Don't put it in such an embarrassing way! I was just venting a little!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:I see...+By the way, my way of venting is spreading words of how others vent.+I've recorded the whole thing. Look forward to tomorrow's Fatebook.

PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...+RO, I just came back from Helian and have learned quite a few things.+Including what you want to know - what AR-15 has left behind...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Make it back alive, and I'll tell you, got it?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+Deal.+Think about where to start before I come back.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:Then let's begin.+I'm handing ops to you, Makarov.+First, deploy our forces here...
