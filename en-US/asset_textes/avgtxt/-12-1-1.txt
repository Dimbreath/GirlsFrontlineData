BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Welcome back, Destroyer. +Five minutes ago, you were killed by Squad 404's sniper when you goofed up. +Luckily for you, I backed up your records while you were dormant. This core is now all that's left of you.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:I...got killed? +So I don't have to be a big dog anymore?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:What? Do you miss it?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:L-Like I would! +Did I manage to complete the mission?!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Hush now... I'm still trying to find out. +UMP45's signal seems to have disappeared completely... +Congratulations, Destroyer. You did manage to complete your mission a second before your death.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Oh...is that so? Then give me a new body already!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Listen up, kid. +I don't know what trick Squad 404 pulled off back there, but you almost ruined everything. +Let me remind you while you still remember me...
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Next time you ignore what I tell you and proceed to think with your ass... +I'll stuff you into a body so hideous you can't die even if you want to! +Got that?!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:D...Dreamer...what happened to your voice... +S...scary... Was that really you...?
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Heheh. Just kidding, of course. +We're such good friends, after all. Always have been. Heheh... +Now let's start the final game!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Game...? What game?
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Obviously... +The ruthless and bloody game of...cat and mouse.
