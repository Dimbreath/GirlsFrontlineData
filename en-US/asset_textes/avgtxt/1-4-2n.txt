MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Miss Helian, here are the reports on Sangvis Ferri's stationed forces in the area.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Well done, MP5. Thanks for the hard work.+Let me see...+Sangvis Ferri has actually got their hands on this many armored units. The real estate agencies are gonna shake in their boots when they learn of this.
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:So what should we do...? Can we counter this attack?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Of course not, but we won't have to.+Those are all military armored units that got hacked by Sangvis Ferri. The military will have to clean up their own mess.+We'll just help out here and there and stick our hand out for financial compensation.
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Will...that be enough...?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:What's that, MP5?
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:I just wish I could do more and be relied on, by both my companions and humans alike...+That was why I had taken this assignment. I wanted to become stronger...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:(Chuckles) All of you are altered from T-Dolls meant for civilian use. There's no way you'd beat military T-Dolls no matter how strong you become.
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:You have a point. We are weak. Our weapons are obsolete. Even our characters are problematic.+So where...does our worth lie...?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:There are things that only you can do, MP5. That's the reason why Griffin has chosen you.
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But...I still wish to earn my place through my abilities.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Don't worry. Griffin won't let our own T-Dolls be inferior to military T-Dolls forever.+But that requires time, capital, and everyone's effort.+You are right to have such aspirations. Keep fighting, and leave the rest to us.
NPC-Helian(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Thank you, Miss Helian! I will also do my best on my next mission!
