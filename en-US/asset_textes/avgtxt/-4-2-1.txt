M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Haha... Don't worry. We're all pretty experienced here. We won't slow you down.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You'd better not... +We're never gonna hear the end of it if your team loses another member.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ah! Um! Speaking of which! +Uh... +Anything to say, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh...? +Uh... In terms of experience, we do have more say regarding infiltration. +RO, there's a Sangvis command post ahead. +I think cutting off its surveillance will ensure our safe passage.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Hmm...I agree. +I'll think of something to keep the coast clear. The rest is up to your team, UMP45.
