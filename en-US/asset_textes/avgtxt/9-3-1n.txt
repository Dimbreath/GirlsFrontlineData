()<Speaker>M3</Speaker>||:Miss T65, watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:...Bang.
()<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:I almost got hit... That was close... +Where the hell is the button to start recording?! +How am I supposed to work this piece of antique?!
()<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Look, the light is on. +It's already started recording, you simply haven't taken off the lens cap.
()<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Huh?? Oh!

M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Keep running! +Move quickly to the extraction point!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:...Bang!

()<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Captain⁠—
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss M3, we need a hand over here! Hurry!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4</Speaker>||:Coming!
()<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Pant...pant, pant, pant...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Stand aside. Executing the Master's orders is always the top priority. +She may not have instructed me on what to do with you, but if you get in the way, I will obliterate you... +M16A1.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,0.6</黑屏1>:Are those your last words, Sangvis scum?

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...40 minutes ago.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN><Night><SE1>Explode</SE1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...A violent explosion from not far away.
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:... +The place that got blown up...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Isn't that...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:...the safe house we were in?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Uh...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:You made a beeline for us after running into S.F. out there... +We did notice soon enough...but thanks to you, the safe house was exposed...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:The enemies came out of nowhere the moment we finished collecting the parts! +We didn't have time to think it through...
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:We were this close to making the video... +Why did the Sangvis patrols have to sniff us out now...?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:...I'm afraid these enemies are much trickier than mere patrols. +Even if your friends hadn't run back here, the safe house wouldn't have protected us for long.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Huh?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Judging from the scale of this attack, that midget has finally caught up with us.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Has she still not given up...? +She's such a bother...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Midget... You mean that lame Destroyer?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:She, too, is a midget, but this one is an advanced Doll that I've never seen before.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:...Why are so many of Sangvis Ferri's advanced Dolls little girls?
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:My guess is that Mastermind is also a runt, so she doesn't like keeping tall people around her.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:That kinda makes sense...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Jokes aside, this new midget is armed with weapons more powerful than most S.F. and is a lot more mature than you'd think. +We are no match for her.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Is that...why you've been hiding in the safe house, Miss Thompson?
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:We haven't been hiding! +We were monitoring friendly signals in this area!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Enough, M14. +We busted AK-47's squad out. It's only natural that would make us S.F.'s new targets.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Then...what do we do now?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Garand, you know full well it's impossible to complete your objective tonight. +We can only focus on giving the midget the slip.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:In the end...we have no choice but to give up...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Sigh...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:How can you say that?! +Garand, there must be a Plan D, right?!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:...I'm afraid not. +Miss Thompson is right. Under such conditions, it's impossible to keep filming. +All we can do for now is protect ourselves.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker><Shake>||:No way...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:That Sangvis Doll is coming for me and M14, so we can split up and make a break for it. +Then we'll regroup at the safe house at these coordinates and withdraw.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:But won't that put you—
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:It was our earlier action that got her involved. +This is the best way to keep you safe.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:To be fair, that IS the course of action that would benefit the most of you. +Unfortunately, I'm the one in charge of destroying you. +Let me be the Judge of your sins.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,6</黑屏1>:What?!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...The Sangvis Doll remains oblivious to M14's and Thompson's attacks.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:... +I assumed this was just the usual search & destroy... Totally didn't expect I'd have to get serious and execute Mastermind's order.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...She ignores Thompson and M14 and charges straight toward the others.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hold on! We're the ones shooting at you!</color>
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||<震屏>:She's coming!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Ahhhhh! This isn't what we agreed on, Miss Thompson!! +She's heading straight for us!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Why?! +Isn't Miss Thompson a much bigger threat?!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:You can't hide from me even if you disguise your signal as someone not from the AR Team! +<Size=55>M4A1!</Size>
M4A1(3)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||<震屏>:Huhhhhhh??? +N-n-n-n-no, you're mistaken!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:What the hell?! +How did this happen?!!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||<黑点1>:We can't possibly explain this. +Just hurry! +There's a Sangvis command relay station up ahead! We can use that to keep the other S.F. units from getting in our way!
