NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger, the analysis is out.+The information left behind by AR-15 matches with Squad 404's previous discovery.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Looks like Sangvis Ferri intends to wipe out Griffin once and for all with their next plan.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:So soon? I find it hard to believe they have that many T-Dolls in reserve.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:They don't need T-Dolls, Helian. She has something way more dangerous up her sleeve.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Mr. Kryuger... You've already found out so much.+Did you really come across her in that building?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:...+It's raining on the plain, and parapluie...or umbrella...is the key.+No matter. With AR-15's information, we can now find the exact location of this Plan Parapluie.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:AR-15...+She's still doing her best to help us even now...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:She is merely fulfilling her purpose, Helian.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:I understand, but right now I'm just a little...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:I have no prejudice against T-Dolls, and I am very grateful for the duty they shoulder for mankind's sake.+I can also understand why some field commanders treat them as equals.+But whether you view them as tools or friends or whatever...+The moment they fall under outside control, you have to make a choice.+Bid them farewell in person, or stand by and watch as they drag everyone along into the abyss.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Then...our choice is...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Give it a bit more time, Helian. The choice is not ours to make.+That commander stills needs some time.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Is this another...grooming session?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<黑屏1>:No...
Kyruger()<Speaker>Kyruger</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:This time, it's a test.+Helian, take stock of our T-Doll roster. Report all the ones fit for battle.+We must be prepared. It's our turn to make a move now.
