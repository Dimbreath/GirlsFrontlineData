Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑屏2>:SOP-II, you're back at last!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I've thought of a plan! Listen up, everyone... +I know we don't have much command efficiency, so I'm going to give you guys discretion over how to implement this plan. +It won't tax you guys much, and you'll have ample time to react. +Now, you have to listen closely. Remember the key words "if" and "then"—
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:...Hmm, mhmm. +...Mhm, got it, and then, mhm... +...Then, mm... hmmm, and then...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<震屏>:Huh? Wait! +SOP-II, w-what are you saying?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I expected that reaction, but you didn't hear me wrong.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Are you serious?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I don't joke around when giving orders!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<黑屏1>:Then... why?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Why... are we going to draw fire from the Military for Sangvis Ferri?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:It's not as bad as you make it sound. +S.F. is now the Military's primary target. I have a Sangvis signal on me, so I can help lure away the Military's pursuit units.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Will you be okay by yourself?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I've fought the Military several times. I can't beat them, but I can still evade them. +Take this opportunity to get to the base on the other side and wait for me there.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:That base on the other side is empty and looks safe, but the road there is lined with Sangvis defensive installations. Won't they intercept us?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Maybe they'll fire on the Military instead. +After all, if they prioritize wiping us out, the Military will finish them off soon enough.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:So it's a gamble... +And even if we reach that empty base, it's still in Sangvis territory. Have you thought of our route after that?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Nope. This is all I could come up with. +If you run into Military units, fight them. But if you run into Sangvis units, don't make the first move. After that, hold on until I get back.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:SOP-II, you mean... we're going to protect Sangvis Ferri? In order to buy time for that Scarecrow?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That's right, we're going to delay the Military, then retreat from the base while they're wasting their time running around for nothing. +If we let the Military wipe out S.F., then once their two pursuit parties link up, we're the ones who'll be in trouble.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Somehow... I doubt Scarecrow's going to appreciate this.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:She probably won't, but we're not doing this for them.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:SOP-II, don't you hate S.F.? +I thought... you would never do anything to help them.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I gave it some thought just now... I guess I don't actually hate them. After all, I've killed all the S.F. I had a grudge against already... +...They've all died to me at least once.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:So, you don't hate the rest of S.F.? T-Then... why do you like hunting them down so much?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I just do. +Do you hate people and things as a hobby? I know I don't.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Y-You just like hunting S.F., right?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Nope. +I also enjoy torturing them, scrapping them - Oh, I don't mean removing the Imprint the way Griffin does when they retire T-Dolls, I mean literally taking them apart.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:N-No, I mean...you <size=55>ONLY</size> hunt S.F., right?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The Military's not bad either. Maybe they're better? If possible, I'd like to try on limbs from a Military unit! +And that Yegor...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:T-Then... what about Griffin T-Dolls?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Griffin? Are you kidding? You guys are so good to me! +You don't know me, but you greet me every day, give me tasty stuff to eat, and praise me when I do well! Why would I ever do that to you?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:T-That's true...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I may not know you guys, but I know that whenever I kill a whole bunch of S.F., everyone lives on, and they like me more, right? +It finally occurred to me that right now, my objective is to protect you; helping S.F. out is just a way to do it.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:SOP-II...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Alright, let's head out! Hang in there, and remember what to do when you run into Sangvis units!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Will you be okay? We won't leave without you!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll be back, I... I can't just do whatever I want with myself anymore. +After all, protecting myself means protecting you. That falls within my objective!
