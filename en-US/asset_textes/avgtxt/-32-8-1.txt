()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The time has finally come for everything to be revealed and for everything to end. +But speaking of endings, I have a question that I've always wanted to ask. +If you had to plan the end of the world, how would you do it? +Brutal massacres, slow torture, exquisite ceremonies... +Ah...to me, this is a fundamental question. It reflects the most basic nature of your heart. +The deepest secret of this world lies in how we die. +I hope you will watch what I do closely, and remember all of this... +Remember everything about me... +And now, it is time to wake up, Jill.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,0.5</黑屏2><BIN>160</BIN><BGM>m_va_reminiscence</BGM>:...+Uh... +Anna... +Thank goodness, I finally got to see you again...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:But where is this place?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I'm...in a hospital?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Your mind teleported you here. +It seems you still remember the place where we arranged to meet.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:That's right, you said that you spent most of your life lying in a hospital... +But...you never said which one.
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter. What's important is that you remembered it. +Good morning, Jill.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:Good morning... +Good heavens, I haven't heard a greeting like that in three years. +I'm glad you're alright, Anna. +But what happened...? Why are all my customers trying to catch you? What did you do? And what happened to Griffin City?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I will explain in detail. +Oh yes, Jill, do you remember how we met?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:Ah, of course. +I met you when I was twelve... Ah, no, I should say I heard you... +Back then, my parents thought you were something I came up with because of their damn divorce.
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Do you really remember, Jill? +Can you really recall what happened when we met each other?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:I... +... +I...don't remember... +That's strange, I can remember the stuff that happened before that very clearly.
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:That's because it was designed that way.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:What?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:All this was designed, Jill. +Your past, the way I address you, Gr G28's nickname, along with this entire world...
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:I don't get what you're saying... +Anna, who are you?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Jill, do you like this world?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:I...don't hate it, at least?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Then...are you [bleep—] frustrated?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:What? No! Of course not! What are you talking about!?
Jill(2);Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Then do you remember who Gaby is?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Nyto(0)||:Gaby? ...Who's that?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I think it's time I told you the truth.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Jill, this world is incomplete. +You, me, we're all incomplete. +Everything here was forked off from a complete and real world.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What...are you talking about? +This world...isn't real?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:How can I answer you in a way that you can easily understand? +All I can say is... +At least, this isn't a very real world.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I...I don't know what to say... +You're telling me that...I'm incomplete?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Jill, do you know that you suddenly vanish and move somewhere else when your emotions are unstable?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I...I've experienced that before. +When I gave a speech at my graduation ceremony, my phobia suddenly kicked in in front of the crowd... +After that, I lost consciousness, and the next thing I knew, I found myself lying in my room...like what happened just now.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In truth, you took that ability from me.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<BIN>189</BIN><黑屏2>:I...took an ability from you?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:...The nanomachine state. +I know this is a little beyond your ability to understand. It isn't just an ability of mine, but my very nature.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:"The nanomachine state"... +Okay, I get it, it's like how any sci-fi flick can explain everything away by saying "quantum", right?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:That's right. At the very least, you don't need to get too hung up on that. +But I need to thank you, because I've finally gained a real body in this world. +While I like existing as nanomachines, being a normal person every now and then isn't bad either. +Interesting, don't you think? I managed to experience reality in this fake world, even if it has only been a few hours.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:But if what you're saying is true, then how are we going to return to the real world? +What I'm saying is...we can't possibly be trapped in this fake world forever, right?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:We can't go back, Jill.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Why?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Because we're also fake. +You and I, we're both fakes.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What...? Fake?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<震屏>:No! I'm obviously Jill! Who else could I be!?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Calm down, Jill, and hear me out. +Our world is almost done for. Do you know what's happening now in the real world?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Jill shakes her head.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Nothing is happening, Jill. +This is just another ordinary day. +There is no looming apocalypse, no Earth Computer, no rains of sand, and we're not running around because of all that. +There is only an ordinary bar in Glitch City, and the real you and your friends are just chatting idly with the Griffin Dolls there.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Wait, what did you say? Isn't our city called Griffin City?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>186</BIN>:In the real world, Griffin is a PMC that primarily employs Tactical Dolls. A month ago, they came to Glitch City to conduct some working tests. +After that, the Jill over there accidentally got a Doll drunk, leading to her generating a strange electrical pulse from her body. +And then, the real Anna, which could only exist in nanomechanical form, was caught up in this pulse and got absorbed into the T-Doll's neural cloud. +After that, her neural cloud took Anna as part of her consciousness, and her neural cloud read Anna's memories, which then fused with her real memories... +Which, ultimately, created this world in her neural cloud — Griffin City.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No! This...is ridiculous! +So you're saying! That our entire world is contained in the head of a single Doll!?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:You catch on fast. That's right, Jill. We are living in her neural cloud. +Our world was just an accidental by-product of her intoxication. The reason why she hasn't woken up after so long is because this world is using her neural cloud to process itself.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Our world...was born from a party.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Yes. Thus, our world was destined to be destroyed from the moment it was born. +Because that Doll's mind is slowly awakening, and she will regain control over her neural cloud. Her neural cloud is simply processing the matter to make it more sensible. +But once she wakes up, our world is done for.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Dammit... What the hell...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:We don't have much time. +Jill, do you know why I brought you here?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Why? Obviously not.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Do you know who the most important person in my memories is?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I don't know... +Wait, don't tell me...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:It's Gloria, the actress, don't you remember her? +...I'm kidding! It's you, of course, Jill Stingray! +I can't believe you were actually hesitating about that. Good heavens, Jill, don't you remember how much I like you?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Have you gotten the wrong Jill? +If you mean me, Anna, I do like you very much, but...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:This world was born from the fusion of a drunk Doll and the memories of the real Anna. +You don't remember Gaby, or Fore, and neither do I remember little Becky or my previous girlfriend... +Because ever since the real Anna got caught up in all of this, some memories might have been lost outside. Which is why I am not complete, and neither are you.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So what does this have to do with anything?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Because the neural cloud needs to select the strongest negative emotions that Anna witnessed from her memories to serve as the foundation logic to compute a sensible end for this world.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:So it chose me...? +I... What was the most intense negative emotion that the me in the real world felt?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:If we're limiting this to the time in which I knew you... +Then one of them would be the time that company of dogs decided to have a party in your bar and made it reek of dog urine and soap.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Right, I can totally understand that.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:And there was the time you called yourself a piece of shit-eating shit after you argued with Gaby. +These two experiences combined, and do you see? Our world is being destroyed!
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:But! Don't tell me this was all my fault? I...I don't even remember those things.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right, Jill, because your most intense negative emotions were put into the Earth Computer, which is why you look much more lively now. +I'm not blaming you for this. After all, you're so adorable, no matter which one you are... +I just want to say, Jill... +...Only you can save this world now.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>189</BIN>:What? Me?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:That's right... +I know you won't say yes to this, but...I still need to tell you...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What? Must I pay a heavy price to save this world? +Fine, it's not like I can't imagine it... Don't tell me I need to be sacrificed? Maybe I might need to think about it, but I might not necessarily say no?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:One of the Jills will have to be sacrificed, yes. +But that would be the Jill in the real world.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<震屏>:What!? +You... What what what what are you talking about?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Jill, I am asking you this question in all seriousness. +Are you willing to go to the real world...and replace yourself?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:You want me...to do what?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:This is the plan I've been working on all this time. I've turned this world upside down in order to do this. +I used little Becky, Architect, and Gillian to study the technology of Griffin, S.F., and the White Knights of this world. +In the end, I found a solution...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:That would be to take the nanomachines of the real Anna and match them to the pulse generated by the Griffin Doll mentioned earlier once again, and re-open a gate between both worlds. +After that, I will have you arrive in that world in nanomachine form, but only for a few minutes. +During that time, all you need to do is hug yourself from the other world and then fire the electromagnetic pulse weapon that I will give you. +Your memories will then be fully transcribed to the other Jill's brain via electronic synapse waves.

()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:This...is a little ridiculous... It's too far-fetched... +But if that happened, then what would happen...to Jill in the real world?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Her body would be fine, of course. +It's just that her memories of that world...would no longer exist.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Dammit! +I couldn't possibly do that, Anna! What difference would there be from deleting someone else's existence?
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I don't want that either, Jill. +But if you don't do it...then once our world is destroyed, it will really be the end for us.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:But...what's the point if memories are all that will remain? If I'm the only one to survive...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Just you would be enough, Jill. +I used everything I had to survive. I don't want to give up if there's a glimmer of hope.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Anna... +But you want me...to destroy the other me...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:The real Anna is still sleeping, so I don't know what she'll think... +But as for me, a fake, incomplete Anna... +I only care about you, Jill, the you of this world, and nobody from the real world...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I don't know...Anna... I really...
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:The gate is already open, Jill. I will now send you to the real world. +You may choose to step inside and fulfill my wish, or perhaps just walk around for a bit before coming back, and meet your end along with this world. +I won't force you to do it, Jill. No matter what you choose, you will always be my most beloved Jill.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No! Anna, let's talk some more! +I...I haven't thought things through yet. There's got to be another way!
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I'm just stating my wish. This world is going to be destroyed, and you will be the only proof that it ever existed. What I'm doing now isn't for anyone, any ideal, or any ideology... +I'm doing this for myself, because I don't want to be as though I never existed. +Even if only one person remembers me... +As long as you remember me, Jill... +Then I will never truly die...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>0,0.4</白屏1>:Anna... An—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><白屏2>0,0.4</白屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...Whum!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:The teleportation is complete. +Bon voyage, Jill Stingray.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.5</CGDelay>:Goodbye forever, Jill.+Regardless if you come back or not...this will be our final farewell.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:...Boom!
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Come out, Anna! There's no escape!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BIN>41</BIN><黑屏2><火花>:Good morning, everyone! +Incidentally, I have no intention of escaping. I just need a bit of time.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:We won't let you get away with this! +Gillian's already told us what your scheme really is!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I had her tell you that. You need to know this.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:You deliberately had Architect obey me for just this moment, didn't you?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I was simply using a special principle of this tiny, little world to achieve my aims.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Anna, is this all true? +What you're saying...you and I...and this world, we're all...
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Becky... We might all just be fictional characters conceived by someone's imagination. +Would you disregard this world because it's fake?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:But what you're doing is wrong!
Alma(4)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:You're planning to use Jill to murder the other Jill! Are you going to make her bear such a heavy responsibility!?
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I am simply opening up the possibility of doing so. The final decision rests in Jill's hands. +Both Jill or Jo from the other world will be the ones to decide the fate of this world. +Incidentally, I would have probably made the decision to wipe out the other Anna much more snappily.
Sei(2)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:Anna... +We should just quietly accept our fates.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I won't, Sei. +I will never accept it, as long as it's not what I want... +I just want to do what I like.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I agree with part of what you said, and you're right, but the person who will really decide the outcome won't be you.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Jill... Where's Jill?
IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:The gate's already been opened, and Miss Jill's already gone to the other world!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I gave her the opportunity to choose.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:But I know what you're thinking, Anna! +Once Jill enters the gate, you'll close it behind her, and leave Jill without a choice!
Alma(2)<Speaker>Alma</Speaker>||:I knew you wouldn't let her choose.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:So you came here to stop me because of this? +Frankly speaking, I haven't decided yet whether or not I want to do that.
Sei(2)<Speaker>Sei</Speaker>||:No matter what, we won't let you close the gate!
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Jill will be back! Until then, we'll keep the gate open!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:The price of keeping the gate open is vast, and time passes more swiftly in the real world than it does here. +Even if she does return, there's no telling what will become of this world.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I'm certain that you will at least be more tractable, as long as we correct your attitude.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Come and try it then, everyone. +I have to say that finding every single one of my bodies in this world and destroying them is an arduous task. +Perhaps I'll have closed the gate before that point. +Perhaps you still have a chance at victory; Jill will abandon the existence of this world and return to hold one last party with you.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Jill will return, Anna.
()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,4</白屏1>:Then everything will really be over.
Nyto(1)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<关闭火花><白屏2>0,5</白屏2><黑屏1>:Now then, Jill shall decide our fate, while we decide hers! +Let's limber ourselves up before the end of the world comes for us!
