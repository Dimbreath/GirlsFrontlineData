破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Where is this place?
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Welcome to the future, dear player.+Here you will experience a brand new online virtual reality...+...And the technological legacy of mankind from 40 years ago.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Dreamer...is that you?+Stop messing around, what are you up to this time?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Hehe, I'm just here to congratulate you. Progress on your new body has passed the halfway mark.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><通讯框>||:What? Are you for real this time?+It's not going to be some piglet or puppy to mess with me, is it?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:Hmm...+Probably not, since you won't be going on a pursuit mission.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hah, that's a relief...+Huh, wait, what did you say? So last time...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:In any case, this time you'll be getting a true remodel. (Destroyer "Hey! Listen to me!")+Rejoice, young lady. Your wish is about to come true.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Humph...well, of course I'll be very happy if I can get what I want.+That said, my enthusiasm's been dashed by that big dog earlier...+Not to mention, 404 is already within our grasp, so a powerful body like that won't be too useful anymore.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:Don't say that. 404 isn't surrendering that easily.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Really? I mean look, they've shown no signs of activity for 3 hours already.+Since you said they couldn't have slipped the cordon, they must be cowering in some corner waiting to die, right?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:Destroyer...how little you understand them.+A death-or-glory attack at a time like this? Squad 404 isn't the type to lose their cool even when they're desperate...+That's why, they're in fact the most dangerous when they're huddled up somewhere.
()||:...Dreamer sits down on a chair and starts fiddling with her hair.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:One possibility is that UMP45 might have survived the network attack earlier...+Yes...they must be hiding somewhere, trying to save UMP45, because she's their only hope of escape.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Tsk, so they'll fight like cornered rats. What can they even hope to achieve?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:Don't underestimate them.+Right now, Squad 404 has ample supplies, plenty of help, and a lot of time to organize their echelons. They might even have new weapons and traps.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You mean...those little drones?+Despite their meager firepower, all the tricks they can pull make them very annoying.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:That's why we can't sit around in the base waiting for news, Destroyer. We'll move out once your remodel is complete.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Got it!+Oh yes...do you have any more of those big doggies from earlier?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:What, so you do miss that body after all?
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Like hell I do!+While it sucked to be one, it'd be pretty reassuring to have one by my side...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BOSS-6(0)||:Heheh, I knew it, the two of you are a good match...+Don't worry, it might still be in the experimental phase, but I can build another one.+Your new body and your new servant will soon be complete.
BOSS-11(0);BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Don't mess it up this time! I'd better become a Doll that surpasses all the other S.F. Dolls in both looks and power!
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Your wish is my command, Miss Destroyer. You need only wait a little longer.+In return, I'd like you to annihilate Squad 404...+You can manage that, right?
