SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:M16, look at that!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>48</BIN>:Is that...Jupiter?!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That's right, it's a Jupiter cannon. +Keep your distance. We don't stand a chance against its firepower.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What do you know about this thing, RO?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We've run into something like this when patrolling human settlements in the past. +According to Persica's research, Sangvis Ferri probably acquired cannon technology after hacking into the Military's database. +Codenamed "Marduk" internally, it's most definitely developed especially to thwart us.
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Humph, "Griffin Killers", are they? +But there's a way to deal with them, right?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's almost impossible to take them head-on, but from what we've learned in our previous operation... +If we coordinate our forces to seize the checkpoints surrounding a mortar, we can hack into its system and significantly reduce its firepower.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2>:That's to say, we can neutralize its threat as long as we have it completely surrounded, right?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Precisely. If we really have to go against one, that's the best way to go at it. +Surround it first, then charge at it and take it out.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Well...guess we should pray this battle doesn't come too soon.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yeah, only think about it after we replenish our supplies. +Right now...we can hardly move as it is with the cold and the hunger...
()||:【HINT】To take over a cannon node, occupying its surrounding nodes first can greatly reduce the cannon's firepower.
