()||<BIN>301</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +0006 hours, in the Lincoln Tunnel. +In another corner, after Gr G11 has frozen to death.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...Ow hot! +45! Don't push the coals at me!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, this is funny. To think Dolls have fallen to the point where they can't take action without external warmth. +If the engineers at the factory knew this, would they cry?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...That's enough, my head aches. +I would never have imagined that Gr G11 would die because of such a stupid reason.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Haha, well, I think this sensation is quite interesting. +Are we more human now?  +We're not just imitating them, but actually warming ourselves to stay alive! +I used to work with humans, and they kept saying that Dolls didn't need to stay warm, so they wouldn't even give me a blanket!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:They were right. +What would you even do with a blanket? It's not like Dolls need to sleep.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I know, which is why I said this was a novel experience~ +But if we're really going into this, why do you still eat anyway?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I was a military Doll, and when I was in service I had to pay attention to how I interacted with human soldiers. +It would be counterproductive if I triggered the uncanny valley effect in humans under high stress and caused them to attack me. +Also, food can substitute for power to a certain extent. The conversion efficiency isn't too high, but it works for emergencies.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ehhh... That's a rational but boring answer. +Civilian Dolls were made just to live with humans, with all other functions being of secondary importance. +But I guess they're fundamentally all the same?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's a very dangerous thought to have, 9. +Don't think about these things, they'll make your neural cloud go weird. +Do you want to end up like those S.F. lunatics?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Eek... Don't scare me like that, 45!+How could it be so bad, I simply thought it felt very new.+You see, I never even considered what it's like to feel cold or hungry!+But now, these sensations are actually having an effect on us.+It's really fun!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This game's simulated environment is a far cry from real life. +The way it forces you to keep these elements in mind is also to enforce limitations which encourage taking tactical courses of action. +Granted, it's an old and busted antique, but a surprising amount of thought went into its design. +I guess I could spare some time to indulge in it.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So what do you plan to do now? +I've never played a game like this before. +It's obviously different from combat simulations too. +Plus, all these data don't take our actual situation into account. What a pain.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What do I want to do, you ask? My plan is to survive to the end and win the prize. Did you even have to ask? +Spare a thought for your team leader here, who has to support an entire family by herself. +As for the game's difficulty and its modes... +Well, it's a game made for humans, so comparing it to sim training would be too harsh. +Still, there are benefits to this. Our chances of winning are very high in games with programmed limits like this.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'd advise you not to take it too lightly... There's no telling what might happen in an unknown realm. +Also, who knows how many people like you there might be in store.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You don't need to worry about that. +I want to emphasize this again - our course is decided now that Gr G11 is dead. +There are a total of 24 players in this game, so only an idiot would give herself 23 opponents. +All we need to do is deal with the last one, got it?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Understood. Isn't that pretty much what I said, though? +I've always preferred guerrilla tactics to direct confrontations. +Since Gr G11 can't log in again, that's all we can do.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:This has always been our forte, after all. +There's no honor in ambushing enemies, but it's super effective!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:All your decency must have rotted away for you to take such shameless pride in this sort of thing. +Also, 45's tactic may be underhanded, but it is more than just ambushing and sabotaging our rivals. +The key is to sit back and reap the rewards.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ahahaha... I didn't expect you to understand her so well, 416.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Shhhh.
()||:As the pair banter with each other, UMP45 suddenly freezes and gestures for the others to keep quiet as well.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What's wrong, 45?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Quiet... I hear something.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:6 o'clock. +Roughly 40 meters away.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:9, kill the fire.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okay!
()||<BIN>301</BIN><黑点2>:The trio reacts swiftly, and after putting out the campfire with snow and ashes, they vanish behind cover in an instant. +As the air grows silent, the sounds from the distance steadily become clearer.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:... +...Hic.
()<Speaker>Squad 404 Minus 11</Speaker>||:...
SKS(2)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:This place is a freaking joke... All these cars and you can't drive a single one of them? +How the hell is this realistic?! +And where the hell did those two jerks go? How dare they abandon me!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +Is she drunk?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, I have to hand it to these Griffin Dolls, they always make their entrance in the most surprising ways. +She's been separated from her people for some reason, that much I can tell, but what is she looking for?
()||:After taking a good look at SKS' face, 45's expression grows strange. She chambers a round quietly. +Meanwhile, 416, who's yet to notice 45's bizarre behavior, continues observing the enemy and voicing her observations.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Beats me. Sounds like she's looking for a vehicle, perhaps? +That said, I've tried them all, the vehicles in this game are just props with no actual functionality.
SKS(3)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:...Bicycles. If it's cycling, does it even count as drunk driving?! +Bicycles...don't count.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Don't you think she looks very familiar?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Familiar? I do believe I know her, but we've barely ever interacted, have we? +I don't think we need to disturb her. Just leave her be, it's too early to launch an attack right now. +If I remember correctly, she's part of AK-47's gang, it's not worth it to—
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()||:UMP45 fires an accurate shot square into SKS' forehead as the latter stumbles around. +A ray of brilliant white light flares up, and the staggering Doll keels over backwards and vanishes into the snow under 416's dumbfounded gaze.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
()||:The snowflakes drift and the cold wind blows.
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:X aaaa killed Green Mark Vodka.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What the HELL are you doing?! +Weren't you going on and on about how we were supposed to stay hidden and all that?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ah... Sorry, I did that on reflex. Force of habit, I suppose.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Habit my ass! +Also, what's this "aaaa" username? +Rich of you to say anything about Gr G11 when you're no better than her!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I think what she said makes quite a lot of sense. +Being killed by someone with a name like this will definitely cause a lot of psychological trauma. +Also, nobody will ever guess that it was me.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Your allies are the first to suffer psychological trauma! +I don't want to be on a team with people called "Pink Nyan Nyan Punch" or "aaaa"!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh, by the way, my username is "Reina".
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This is hopeless! This blasted team is a freaking joke!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now, now, why are you making such a scene? +Are you trying to draw all the enemies to us? +All the melodrama aside, what's YOUR username?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...That's none of your business!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's okay if you don't tell me. We'll find out sooner or later. +Still, I just had the strangest feeling. For some reason, the moment I saw her face, I felt like I was back at Griffin's shooting range. +Then all of a sudden, my trigger finger started itching like mad. +See, it was a pretty good shot, right?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Cut the crap! +It's not like she was a practice drone or anything!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, what's done is done, so there's no point whining about it. +More importantly, her corpse is glowing, so shouldn't we go take a look?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What's so special about that? It's not like the corpse is talking or anything. +Let's see... +Half a bottle of water?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I see... So it's an indicator for dropped items, then? +I think I saw something like it in the games Gr G11 played. The darker the color, the higher the item level.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So what level does white represent?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's the lowest tier.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...Doesn't that mean it's totally useless? +What has she been doing the whole time she was in the game?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, there's nothing else of use here... +Forget it, we'd better leave ASAP. It would be bad if someone were drawn by the sound of the gunshot.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are we really not going to take the water? +She probably drank it because she thought it was vodka.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nah. It wouldn't be good even if it WAS vodka. +It's not beer.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Let's just take it, it might keep us warm or reduce our hunger. +I don't want another teammate to freeze to death. +Also, let me get this out of the way first - you'd better not pull this stupid stunt again!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, ja, ja... I know, let's just go already.
()||<黑屏1>:After a brief discussion, the three of them vanish into the snow like ghosts.
