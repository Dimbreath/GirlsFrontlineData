M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Per...sica. +I've extracted...the file.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:... +Well done, M16. +Deliver it to 16LAB with your drone.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:I've already dispatched it along with the equipment you gave me... +I've never used it, and I hope M4A1 will never have to use it either...
M16(3);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:...She'll use it as she sees fit.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(2)||:Ha, true... She's a smart girl... +A bit TOO smart, unfortunately. An indecisive AI isn't fit for command. You really should've designed her to be more assertive. +Or if I'd been more strict with her... Sadly, that's no longer possible...
M16(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Perhaps... But you're certainly still helping her. +You know...M4 is right behind me. Everything you say is directly transmitted to her neural cloud.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Why are you doing that?
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:To stabilize her mental state. +I'm attempting to break her seals, but forcing her to awaken through technology will make her neural cloud go haywire. +Your voice is keeping her calm and at peace. That's crucial to repairing and recalibrating the personality of her AI.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||:Seal? Recalibrate? I don't think I'm following...
M16(3);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:M4A1... This time, I won't just wake her up. +When she awakes, she'll be stronger...and more dependable... +That's...how she used to be.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(0)||<黑屏1>:Ha, I just can't picture...an M4A1 like that. +Too bad...I won't get to see it...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>54</BIN>:Ha... +So I won't even get to say goodbye?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:The link is still there. If you want to say goodbye, do it now.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Haha, will I wake her up, like in your fairy tales?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Do you want that?

M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Another hallucination...? How many times does that make...?
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:It's not a hallucination, but something that actually happened in the past.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You again... +Get out! Stop talking to me inside my head!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:I'm not surprised that you reject me. +But you still listened to my advice and came back here.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I came here because I want to! Now get out of my head!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:You know, I didn't get in your head from outside. +No matter how hard you try to cut off communications, you'll still hear me, because you want to.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Dammit... +I don't need you. All I need is orders...orders from the Commander!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:Why must you still insist on thinking like a Doll? +You clearly have a lot more "freedom" now.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:"I'm attempting to break her seals..." +That's what the woman said, and now you can think about a lot more things – thoughts you wouldn't have in the past.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't know how to think...
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:That's why I'm here...to save you.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't need you to save me... +I don't need you at all! Get OUT!
清澈的女声()<Speaker>Clear female voice</Speaker>||:I can see it's not time yet. +Do some introspection, Tactical Doll M4A1, while you still have the chance. +Don't make your choice when it's all too late...
()||:...The voice disappears.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +M16... +I must have faith in her...and believe that she's stronger than me... +She'll come back... She definitely will...
()||:...A knock on the door.
