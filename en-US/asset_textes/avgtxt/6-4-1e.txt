NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>8</BIN>:As you see, Commander, the Sangvis attack is far from over.+The T-Dolls may have started withdrawing in groups, but the battlefield is still in chaos...+Especially when we still can't determine the number of T-Dolls trapped within the jam.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Sorry I'm late.
NEGEV(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Still alive then, Negev?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Still got a breath left in me, but that's not enough to kill all the enemies.+A few scouts are still in the jam, as well as what's left of the AR Team.+I've pointed them to a base so they're relatively safe for now...+But that's only temporary, as the center of the jam is the heart of the Sangvis camp, which is surrounded by Sangvis units!
NEGEV(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Understood. Hold the base for now. We will send a carrier to get you.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Commander, we need your troops to seize the sentry post in the area to clear and safeguard the course of our aircraft.+Please move with haste and ensure the safe retreat of the last batch of our T-Dolls!
