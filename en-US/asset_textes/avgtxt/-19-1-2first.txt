()||<BIN>2</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Operation concluded. Sangvis forces eliminated.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:They're all so weak! +Even fighting is boring all the way out here. +How much longer do I have to live like this? Boring enemies, boring teammates...
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:AEK?
TMP(0);AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Oh, nothing. Just letting off some steam. +Are you alright, TMP?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;AEK999(0)||:Uh...I think... +I was too nervous to really experience anything.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Now that the enemies are all dealt with, can we call it a day?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Are there any backup forces from S.F., Squad Leader?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Don't think so. +The Commander says that according to HQ's analysis, it seemed to be a Sangvis envoy just passing through the area.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Huh? Why would they be passing through here?!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:The point is – I told you so, 950.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:So what? Think of it as a kind of alternative morning training!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Gee, what's with the temper? +Remember, we won. It's a victory we don't see often. +C'mon, let's go back to the dorm and get some rest. Should we throw a party to celebrate tonight?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Sorry, I'm not particularly gratified by such a small victory. +I'm not coming tonight. Have fun, guys.
()||:...AEK-999 walks off on her own.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:AEK...
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:That kid has been pretty lethargic lately...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑点1>:... +(Mutters) Thunder, come with me.
()||<BIN>70</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:...M950A and Thunder slip quietly into the electronic entertainment room.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Sorry to intrude.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Shush! Why are you announcing our presence?! +Ah...but AEK hasn't arrived yet. Thank goodness.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Should we come back later?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:No. We lie here in ambush, then jump and shout "aha!" when she sits down and logs on – we'll catch her red-handed!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:A...ha...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Maybe just leave that to me...
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Are you certain she'll come?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:She was already thinking about ditching work before the battle and kept objecting to the fight. That's not like her at all. +So something here must have her enthralled.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:...We're exactly like stalkers.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<黑点1>:This is an investigation! C'mon, we've gotta hide.
()||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:...The two T-Dolls conceal themselves but ensured they have a clear field of vision to spy on the rest of the room.
()||:...Ten minutes later.
()||:...An hour later.
()||:...Two hours later.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Whispers) 950... +950, wake up...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>70</BIN>:Hmm...
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<震屏>:(Muffled) Hmm!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:(Whispers) Quiet. AEK is here. +I'm covering your mouth to stop you from making a sound.
()||:...M950A nods, and Thunder lets go.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:...
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:(Whispers) You've really shown up, AEK-999.
()||<黑点1>:...AEK-999 finds a seat and logs on. +...Then it got quiet.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:...15 minutes later, everything is still quiet.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:950, stop sleeping.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I wasn't asleep! +It's about time. She must be pretty preoccupied. +C'mon, let's see what she's doing!
()||<BIN>70</BIN><黑点2>:...M950A and Thunder sneak closer to AEK's seat carefully and start observing.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:(Whispers) ...I can't see what she's doing.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Huh? We just have to take a look at her monitor... +Wait...AEK is...unconscious?
()||:...950 gives AEK a poke. AEK just keeps lying on the chair, completely still.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:She isn't controlling the machine manually. She's directly plugged her neural cloud in.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Her consciousness has entered a deeper Level? +What the hell did TMP tinker this thing into?!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Is she training for electronic warfare?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Impossible. Without the right kind of modification, T-Dolls like us can't handle the stress on our system.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:But then we can't determine what she's doing.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Of course we can! Here!
()||:...M950A drags Thunder to the next seat.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Her connection isn't encrypted. We can simply join the same channel to enter her sector. +Whether she's actually studying or just chatting and "fishing" online, we'll find out soon enough.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Shouldn't we consult the team leader first? I'm worried that...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:What are you worried about? I've been to chat rooms before. They're basically social lounges. +Nothing more than places where a few people dressed as anime catgirls run around asking for head pats.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Is it really that simple? +After all, we know practically nothing about where AEK-999 is.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:How crazy can cyberspace be? If AEK can go, I can certainly go, too. +Besides, I have you with me.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Me?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:That's right, I trust you. +Even if I mess up, we'll be fine together, so I'm not scared at all.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Thunder falls silent for a while, then she nods.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:So, shall we begin?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yeah, let's get cracking! We must catch AEK-999 slacking off this time!
()||<黑点2><SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:...M950A and Thunder lie down on their seats and plug themselves in.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Ready?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||:Yep, let's initiate the connection!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Roger.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>5</黑屏1>:...Thunder takes a deep breath.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Into the Brains!
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What?!
()||:...Buzz!
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Whoa!
()||:...After a bout of dizziness, M950A's consciousness leaves reality and crashes right into cyberspace.
()||:... +...After a long while.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:M950A... +M950A?
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Ugh...
()||:...M950A tries to open her eyes, but her virtual vision hasn't fully recovered.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Cough... +I need some rest, Thunder...
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Same here...
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Seriously, I just can't get used to this without the specialized module... +We haven't dived that deep, have we? But my neural cloud already feels pretty fried...
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Well, this isn't exactly our strong suit.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:But...are we there?
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I guess...we are...?
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:You guess? Then where's AEK? Have you seen her?
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No. +It's too crowded here.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Crowded? You're right...It sounds pretty noisy around us... +What is this place? Is it a large room?
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:What room...do you mean?
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:Huh? I'm obviously talking about—
()||<黑屏1>:...M950A's vision slowly returns. +...And she takes in the world before her eyes.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN><睁眼>:... +Oi... +What... +Where—
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:WHERE THE HECK ARE WE?!!!
