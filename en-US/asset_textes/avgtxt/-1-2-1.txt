UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey Gr G11! Turn off your sleep mode and get ready for battle!
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uuu... I can't... I need some more time to heal...+416 fell on me and broke my waist earlier in that explosion.
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sorry, I'll leave you to explode into a million pieces next time.
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't care... I'll fall apart if I don't lie down. I wanna go home...
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Get up, we're not gonna get paid if we leave now! (Pinch)
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uuuuuuuu...
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Quit teasing her, 9, and look out for their anti-air defense.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:We'll be fine. This aircraft has active camouflage. We won't get spotted unless Dreamer is here.
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Speaking of this aircraft... Where did you guys find this?
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:A Griffin reconnaissance team left it here. Gr G11 found it and reported it to 45.
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Sigh) So you guys lied to me and made me go out of my way for nothing...
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Fool thyself, fool thy enemy. Isn't that right, Gr G11, you little trickster? (Pinch)
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uuuuuuuu...
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Alright, quit playing around. Helian is calling us, pay attention.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Squad 404, the report from our scout in Area S06 has just arrived. The Sangvis has deployed radars that cover the airspace in your path.

UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well...+We are currently near the back of the Area S06 outpost. If we land now, we'll be in a good position for a sneak attack.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45(0)||:You plan on capturing the Ringleader in the outpost to directly get the location of the jammer?
NPC-Helian(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Yes. We don't have a lot of time, so it's better for us to take the initiative.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45(0)||:Very well. According to our report, the Ringleader stationed at the outpost is Hunter.+She has gone through an "Elite" modification. Be careful.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Understood. Are we clear on the objective, everyone?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Find Hunter and defeat her.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It'll be no big deal if even AR Team has defeated her before.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Same as always, huh? Let's go.
