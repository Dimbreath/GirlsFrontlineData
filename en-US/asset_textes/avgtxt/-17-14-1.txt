NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Commander! There's an emergency! +We found forces under the command of S.F. Ringleader Gager during our withdrawal! +She's controlling a lot of troops, and we'll need to break through their defensive line if we want to go down this route! +...Hmm, there's no other choice, is there? Also, our current intel indicates that the enemy's defensive line isn't very solid. +Rather than face some other boss unit whose data we don't even have, at least this enemy is a known quantity. +...That's right...the AR Team once brought this data back. +I wonder what happened to M4A1 and the others... +...You're right! Now's not the time to think about this... At the very least, we should believe the voice in the transmitter. +We'll only have a chance to meet each other again if we survive. Commander, let's break through Gager's defensive line ASAP!
