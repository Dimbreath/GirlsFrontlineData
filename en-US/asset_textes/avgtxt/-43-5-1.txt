()<Speaker>Helicopter Pilot</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><黑屏1>:Evac chopper approaching.+ETA 30 seconds...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>288</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...In the Dark Zone.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Hellfire and Fang? Are you talking about enemies in this game?
NPC-Dima(0)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:You'll understand once they show up. I don't know how to explain it to you now...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Are you trying to spin a story at a time like this?
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:No, I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you... I-I have difficulties that I can't explain!
()||:Dima is having trouble fending off Vector's onslaught of questions, but the tension is soon broken by the beating of rotor blades—
()||<SE1>AVG_Helicopter</SE1>:The evac chopper is now hovering above the extraction point.
NPC-Dima(0)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:The chopper's here!+Cease fire, Vector, the enemy's coming!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Cease fire? As if I could do that! +I won't share victory with the one who killed my teammates!
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:But 416 isn't the one who killed your teammates!+Ahhhhhh— Dammit!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Wait, what are you doing?!
()||:Dima jumps out of cover and waves her arms in all directions, hoping her actions will inform 416 of her desire to cease hostilities.
()<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Whoaaa!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Gott verdammt ...What the hell is going on?
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:416!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Dima... What are you doing here?+Where's that crazy Doll?
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Miss Dima!
()||:Vector pokes her head out from behind cover, her gun barrel pointed at 416.+416 is just as vigilant and levels her weapon at Vector as well.
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:You guys... Stop fighting already...+Please, I'm begging you...+There's a more powerful boss around!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:A boss?
NPC-Dima(0)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:Yes, as I was trying to tell you, the person you met earlier... +Actually, she's—
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—+Dima's words are interrupted by a thunderous explosion that turns the rescue chopper into a massive fireball.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Is that...an anti-air missile?
()||:The helicopter falls like a comet from the sky, trailing flames and smoke as it hits the plaza.+The rotor blades are snapped off by the impact and the fuselage continues careening toward the three of them.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Well, crap.
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:Aaaah!+4-416!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut up and RUN!
()||:Vector dives aside as a wave of heat washes over her.+416 roughly kicks Dima into cover and uses the momentum of the reaction force to throw herself behind another obstacle in the other direction.+Finally, the chopper grinds to a halt after hitting the main door of the UN Headquarters.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Boom—+The second explosion radiates a dazzling light, and the blast generates a powerful rolling shockwave.+By the time 416 and Vector open their bleary eyes and verify each others' position, they find that they have been surrounded by rogue agents.
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1>:Warning, extreme threat detected!+Warning...treme threat det...!
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:The powerful signal disruption is even affecting ISAC. His repeated words of warning bring everyone's eyes to the crash site blazing in the cold darkness of the night, where a pair of figures emerge, much to both 416 and Vector's surprise—
()||<黑屏2><BIN>286</BIN><BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM><火花>:They see "416" and "Vector" - a pair of Dolls who are the spitting image of themselves.+"416" is holding a launcher of some sort in her raised left arm. It's plain to see that she was the one who shot down the chopper.+Meanwhile, "Vector" stands behind her, a riot shield in hand and a cold gleam in her eye. To her, the original 416 and Vector seem to be nothing more than meat for the chopping block.
()<Speaker>416?</Speaker>||:...Found you at last.
()<Speaker>Vector?</Speaker>||:The time for cleansing is nigh. The souls of the sinful shall be redeemed.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Huh? What the hell is the meaning of this?+Are you kidding me, I don't recall ever authorizing such a shoddy copy of myself to be made.
()<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Are they different Dolls of the same model...?+Her parts seem to be different from mine.
()<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I told you, these guys are your enemies... Hellfire Vector and Fang 416!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>288</BIN>:I didn't expect you to still be alive, Hellfire!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...Hellfire?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That Doll who looks like you is the Hellfire you're looking for.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:So you weren't the one who killed R93 and K5...?+What kind of trickery is this, Miss Dima?
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>||:It's not a trick! I was trying to make up for a mistake!+Frankly speaking, if it wasn't because of game compatibility issues, I wouldn't have used your AIs, maybe a GraySkullmon would have been better...
NPC-Dima(2);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Game compatibility? Using our AIs?+What are you talking about?
NPC-Dima(2);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:GraySkullmon...hehe, hahahaha!
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Er... Cut out that creepy laugh, would you?
NPC-Dima(2);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I see, I think I understand.+I get it now!+This way of talking, as well as this extensive knowledge of classic animated series...+That reminds me of no one other than Gr G11... UNLESS— +Sounds like you've been having fun, Dier.
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:... +Urgh! No, I'm not-!
NPC-Dima(3);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Not going to admit it? Alright then, I'll liquidate you now, then I'll pay you a visit in person and...
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dier?</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:N-no, please don't! +...Fine, fine, I admit it! It's me!
NPC-Dima(3);Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:While I'm not too sure what exactly is going on... +The two of you seem to know each other.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:And it would seem Miss Dima...no, Miss Dier is the culprit behind all this?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:He's a guy.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Unforgivable.
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dier?</Speaker>||:Well, er, about this...
HK416(6)<Speaker>Fang</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Ladies? Are you done chatting yet?+If you are, would you mind giving us a bit of screen time?
Vector(6)<Speaker>Hellfire</Speaker>||:The fires of purification...shall burn away all your sins.
NPC-Dima(3)<Speaker>Dier?</Speaker>||:Ahhhh! +I, I promise I'll tell the truth, but could you please get rid of them first?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Tsk, you're pathetic.
()||:Countless rogue agents begin gathering behind the grinning Fang.+Meanwhile, Hellfire raises her gun eagerly like a predator thirsting for blood.
HK416(6)<Speaker>Fang</Speaker>||:You've been naughty, Miss Dima. So you recruited a couple of thieving cats to help you out.+Didn't I tell you before that I was all you need?
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bangbangbang—+A hail of gunfire threatens to pulverize the trio's cover into dust. If this were the real world, they would have been full of holes by now.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:(Gags and chokes)
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...What's the matter with you?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Nothing. +I just got grossed out by how she spewed such nonsense using my face.
()||:After shooting "Dier", who has practically curled up into a ball, another dirty look, 416 turns her attention to Vector.+They've been enemies until now, but after exchanging a glance, they nod to each other in silent accord.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:You'd best prepare yourself, Dier. If you don't give us a satisfactory explanation...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I'll make you regret you were ever born.
()||:Dier gulps as 416 and Vector both shoot him death glares.
NPC-Dima(2)<Speaker>Dier?</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Uh, h-here are my ammo pouch and my medical bag, p-please help yourselves. +Also...make sure you win!
