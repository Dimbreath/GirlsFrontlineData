RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Ready to go, SOP II? The echelons covering us have reached their designated positions.
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Yeah...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：If you need to rest some more...
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I'm fine, now's not the time to rest.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Alright...then let's go.+By the way, SOP II, it may be meaningless to say, but I still want to remind you...+You promised me that you wouldn't charge in recklessly if we come across a Sangvis Ringleader. Keep that in mind, okay?
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：...I...promised that?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：(Sigh) Don't only selectively remember things that are convenient for you.+You acted too dangerously the last time we met Dreamer. If reinforcements hadn't arrived in time...+No matter how much you want to kill them, our objective is to complete the mission, and the mission this time is to find M16.
RO635(3);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I don't just want to kill them, I want to... Do you want to know the difference?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：Um, I don't want to know... Although I've already seen it before with my own eyes.+SOP II, we need to be more cautious in this operation. Meaningless aggression will only endanger ourselves. Who will bring M16 home if we die?
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I understand...sorry...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：I'm not blaming you...+I'm very impressed by your combat capabilities. I just hope that everyone can safely return home this time, no matter who it may be.
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：...I know that you're looking out for me, RO. It's just that sometimes...I can't control myself...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：I believe you can do it. I'll also do my best to help you, since I'm technically the team leader right now.
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Haha, team leader! You remind me of M4!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Mmm...I know that I'm not as good a leader as M4...
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Although your preparations are not as thorough as M4A1, you are more decisive than she is.+M4 was so clumsy when she first became the team leader, I could tell you all about it when we have the time!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：(Bitter smile) I'm actually very interested to hear, but right now we need to hurry up and finish this search first. It'll become too dangerous if we end up searching until nighttime.
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Okay, you got it.
