92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Artillery! Extremely destructive artillery! It's tearing the city apart!+The huge piece of equipment that Sten was talking about must be a Sangvis motar!

RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:...+I'm asking you to give me the document. That's an order!
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:But the human also gave me an order...+According to Griffin's contract, I must help humans whose lives are in peril...

RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>17</BIN><黑屏1>:I can, because...I'm special.+I've retained my authorization from before I came to Griffin...+...And this is precisely the reason why I've returned.
