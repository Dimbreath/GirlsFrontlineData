M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>We've been scanning, pinpointing and burning the enemy for the past few days...then we scan, pinpoint and burn the enemy again...and the enemy can't really fight either...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Doing this sort of thing over and over again...it gets really boring.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I've been looking at monitors all day long myself, I feel like I'm about to go blind.+You're at Position 44, right? Things are almost wrapped up there, as long as you and RO...

NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>In terms of pure efficiency, you were eight hours quicker than I expected.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So, is the mission over? +I'm still waiting for my forces to report in.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is a combat feedback report from a Statesec field agent team.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The information I'm giving you was prepared by professionals, so you can rest easy accepting it.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If that agent team can pinpoint the enemy so precisely, would they mind going ahead and taking them out while they're at it?
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I told you before, their job is surveillance, yours is extermination. Those are the rules of the game.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So the agent team is your alternative plan, then.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>One of them.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Thank you very much for passing me this piece of information. +But more than that, I'd like to know Ange's current situation.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You'll see her soon.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Wait for an update from me.</color>

NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<震屏>:Commander! Breaking news!+ The other four infiltrator units gave their reports, all the information we have suggests that the White Faction units have been completely wiped out!+ Now this entire city district is safe!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yeah, K already told me.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ehh... You already knew...?
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Call back the echelons that have finished their tasks so they can rest. Have the backup echelons who are standing by take up watch positions. +Don't let your guard down, everyone. Even if we appear to have wiped out the enemy, there might still be lurking threats.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Got it—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Kalina leaves.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:(Have they all been wiped out?) +(The White Faction didn't offer any proper resistance right till the end... but even after asking RO to widen her scanning radius, I couldn't find any remaining signals... Are they really so helpless against us?)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...I sweep my gaze over the dozens of monitor feeds before my eyes, trying to find some trace of armed White Faction troops hiding among them. +But that is not possible, the streets of Belgrade are far too peaceful. +Cars travel back and forth, and the streets are filled with throngs of happy, contented citizens. +Perhaps I could tell how many plainclothes police officers there were at a glance, but I can't tell who's a White Faction Doll in hiding. +...As that thought crosses my mind, a familiar figure suddenly appears in the crowd.

()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑屏1>:...She's smiling, a smile that says that she has the situation completely under control. +Are our operations at risk of being exposed? +Is that really the case? Were those enemies just a cover-up while we remain ignorant of the true threat?+ No, that's impossible, if that really is the case, then how could K and Statesec not have realized this? Don't they have any countermeasures in place? +Am I seeing things? Do I make mistakes like that? +As my thoughts reach that point, I feel a chill running down my spine.

NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can't keep anything from you, can I, Commander?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But you're still considered a reserve force among the security detail. Don't get carried away.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:If it's already decided that we are to protect our country's ambassador, then what does Statesec want us to do?
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Our country's ambassador?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Didn't I tell you not to get carried away just now? You aren't qualified to join the ambassador's bodyguards. </color>+<color=#00CCFF>...These are the details of your client this time round.</color>
