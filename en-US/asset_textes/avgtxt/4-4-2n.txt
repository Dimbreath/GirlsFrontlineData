PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><通讯框>||:RO, the local Sangvis signal outpost has been neutralized.+You can conduct your search in peace.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Good job!+I'm searching the area for signs. Hopefully they remembered our code...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Hurry up. Sangvis troops are no threat anymore, but the same can't be said for their artillery.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:I know. Let's just say the bots they've put here are simply for testing their artillery...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Humph, how lavish of them. They have no qualms wasting things they didn't make themselves.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:We really can't say for sure just how many tricks Sangvis Ferri have up their sleeve...+But if this artillery attack had been launched for the purpose of wiping us out, our situation would've been much direr.
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:What is it?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:RO...+What if...we ARE the targets?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? If that were the case, we'd have been dead long ago.+And as you see, their aim is completely random. Only one shell hit 92...+...+Or can it be...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:RO, we're also targets being used to test their artillery.+The enemy ringleader has probably discovered us right from the start, and is only toying with us...or messing with us...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:You...You've got to be joking...+Then the next shell will be aimed at...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:...!+RO, find cover!

Makarov()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:RO! Come in!+RO! RO635!!

AR15(0)<Speaker>AR-15</Speaker>||:It's been a long time, RO.+I don't know if this will be our last call, but due to my current situation, I'll have to cut the long story short.+I probably...can't ever return to the AR Team.+You know, sometimes that's just the way things are. You work hard, but you still end up with a mess.+Enemies, orders, or even just plain bad luck... So many things can ruin your plan...+M16 once said, the difference lies in whether we give up just like that, or we prepare for the worst and keep going.+If you don't see me next time, that means the worst has happened...+But I've already prepared for it. How about you, RO?+Have you prepared...to return to the AR Team?+Of course, you have your own ideas and choices to make... So all I want to say is...+I'm sorry. Forgive me for what I said. You've always been exemplary. I know that.

Stern voice()<Speaker>Stern voice</Speaker>||:Shut up, AAT. Be quiet!
Boisterous voice()<Speaker>Boisterous voice</Speaker>||:♪ Go, go, go! Ale, Ale, Ale! ♪
Stern voice()<Speaker>Stern voice</Speaker>||:You're even singing now. That song is over 60 years old, Grandma!
Mellow voice()<Speaker>Mellow voice</Speaker>||:Alright, we've got her.+But she's still out cold...
Stern voice()<Speaker>Stern voice</Speaker>||:RO! Wake up!+Hey, hey, hey, wake up!
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ugh...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>41</BIN>:Where...am I...?+...Heaven?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:...+(Sighs) Don't you think this is a bit too hideous for a heaven...?
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Maybe she hit her head?
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Huh? Did she?+RO, you lost your memory?+Then I'll introduce myself again. I'm the elite T-Doll AAT-52. You are all my assistants so listen to me.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Come off it! Grow some chest before you think about pulling ranks on me, you blathering piece of tomato!
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Quoi? What's so great about having big boobs?! I had to dig through an extra piece of rubble to pull you out!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Alright, all's good now that RO is fine. We're all safe.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Tsk... What the hell...+So you're all okay, and I've come here for nothing...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:No, Sangvis patrols almost found us...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:We were gonna take them on despite the odds. We even backed up our neural clouds.+Thank goodness your troops got here and drew them away.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Ha... So the operation worked...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:But you actually came here yourself...to confirm our whereabouts?+Have you considered your way of escape? This isn't something a commander should do, is it?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:I told you... I might not be ready to take command...+Besides, I HAVE considered my way of escape...
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hey, RO! You still kicking?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Yeah... Everyone is fine, too. We're all safe.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;PM(0)||:Haha, it's Makarov! You're finally here!+Oh... Have you been crying? Your eyes are all red...
AAT52(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...I rushed here from HQ during the night. I'm just sleep-deprived.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;PM(0)||:But...
AAT52(0);PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:If you keep asking stupid questions, I'm gonna plant all your dummies in the ground.+Anyway, I've called in troops to give you support. You'll make it out before they fire the next round.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Umm... Well... Haha...+In any case, we're finally back together tonight!
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Indeed. The mission is accomplished, too.+Though...we'll have to part again soon...
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Huh? Why is that?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Don't you remember, Sten?+This team is assembled temporarily only for this operation.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Oh, right... And we already have Document 36...+Even though Sangvis Ferri has completely destroyed the city...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:They won't be cocky for long. Makarov will bring word of this back to HQ.+We will come up with something - against that large mortar, as well as the Sangvis ringleader hiding behind it.
MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Yeah. All of us have gone through so much and learned a lot from this operation.+Even if we go our separate ways, I will never forget...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Don't be so melodramatic, Sten. It's not like we'll never see each other again.+Let's have a proper party once we get back tonight!
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+Yeah...+It's not like...we'll never see each other again...+So girls, this isn't the end.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>42</BIN>:We will keep fighting, keep learning on our respective battlefields...+And we'll keep winning, until the day Sangvis Ferri is defeated for good.
92type()<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:...+They say you're not quite the same as other T-Dolls. I think they're right.+You have...a will that Griffin T-Dolls lack.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:...I guess.+So this is why I came back - for Griffin's victory, for justice...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:And...for vengeance...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>43</BIN><黑屏1>:I swear...+I WILL make them pay!+No matter what weapons they fire at us, what strategies they use, what conspiracy they have cooking on the stove...+So long as they cause destruction... So long as they wreak havoc...+I will definitely make them pay!
