()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>22</BIN>:Combat over. Report submitted to Persica.+A short while later, at the Factory at Griffin HQ...
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Here you are, Mr. Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Our next battle is about to begin, so I've come to check up on our T-Dolls.+I've read your investigation report. Thanks for the hard work, Helian.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:It's my duty.+On another note, I just received a report from Persica. She's analyzing M4A1's database.+But the data extracted so far is insufficient. We may need to expand our search area.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:Let her do it herself. We simply aren't capable of organizing any bigger operations.+Our contract states that we should focus our work on things that are so-called...'tactically valuable'.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Another order from the client, huh...+It's almost impossible to get information regarding the AR Team on time when our main forces are left in the wealthy area so far away...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:At least we got something. Those two reports have been very helpful.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Those two reports... You mean the ones about our units stationed in Area S09 encountering M4A1 and a Sangvis Ringleader?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:The AR Team is still surrounded by Sangvis troops in that area. We know that for certain.+Now it's up to Persica.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Then is rescuing the AR Team still our main objective?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||:The AR Team... Or M4A1, at least, must have discovered something very important to Sangvis Ferri.+We still know next to nothing about S.F. Retrieving M4A1 will prove immensely helpful.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:But we can't breach our contract with the client and station our main forces in areas beyond our jurisdiction...
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(1)||:We don't need to send out our main forces.+The commander you mentioned just now is still a rookie, I hear.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Yes. With very dependable abilities.+Someone worth grooming.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<黑屏1>:And I believe here's the first grooming session.
