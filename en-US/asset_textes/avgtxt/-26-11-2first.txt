SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:All enemies are destroyed. What are you waiting for, 416? Report to the Commander already!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Not all. The scanner is reading a few human life signs.
HK416(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Probably just ELIDs. Most of the survivors are unarmed logistics personnel. They either got killed by ELIDs or ran off.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Don't let your guard down. Make sure you leave no one alive, no matter who it is... +...They're right behind this door.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:...They all stop just outside the medical room. Soft moans and a shuffling noise can be heard through the door.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:(Whispers) There really are people in the room, but judging by their positions, they don't seem to be on guard...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:(Whispers) Could be ELIDs.
HK416(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Whispers) In any case, we can't attack unarmed humans!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's not up to you. Just pray our visual reflexes are quicker than our fingers on the trigger. +Ready. On three. One... +Two... +Three!
()||:...Slam! 416 kicks the door open.
感染者()<Speaker>ELID</Speaker>||<BIN>160</BIN><Night><震屏>:GUARGHHHH!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:ELID!
()||<SE2>Gunkill</SE2>:...Bang bang! +...416 and SOP-II immediately kill the ELID within.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I knew it...
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:416, in the corner...
()||:...416 turns her attention to the corner of the room. A few humans are cowering in fear.
()<Speaker>Human female</Speaker>||:Please... I'm just a doctor... please...cough...
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:416, these people are infected, but only mildly.
()<Speaker>Human male</Speaker>||:I...cough...was just trying to save them...cough...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're not saving anybody. SOP-II, tie them up. We're going.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...416 gets in touch with the commander.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Commander, we've seized the surveillance outpost. Now...
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<震屏>:...What? Ange may have been discovered?
HK416(3);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hey, how's that possible...?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:The commander says Yegor's forces...probably realized they hadn't seen Ange with us.
HK416(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Then what should we do? If the military storms the building, this would've been a fool's errand, and we won't make it back in time...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:Their scouts haven't moved in yet. They're probably monitoring us remotely at the same time to visually confirm if Ange really isn't with us.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:What do we do, Commander? Should we return to the building and help Ange?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:...In the comms window, SOP-II is tying up the army doctors behind 416.

RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>160</BIN><Night><黑点2>:416, any ideas yet? The military is going to catch up soon! What do we do?! We can't just conjure an Ange out of thin air!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;RO635(6)||:RO... +Why can't we?
HK416(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:416? What did the commander tell you? What should we do?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:One thing I learned from 404 - no risk, no reward. I'll do anything to complete a mission. +Now, let's play a game.
()||<BIN>46</BIN><黑点2>:...Meanwhile, Ange contacts the commander.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Commander, I... +I'm sorry. I can't think of anything... +Yegor is only after me. If I walk outside, it'll definitely get their attention, especially when they already know something's off.
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Don't give up just yet, Ange. Their scouts are not making a move yet.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:But this time I'm really out of ideas... This is all because of me. I honestly don't know how to keep everyone alive... +Commander, you've done your best, and I have nothing else to say. I think it's time...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ange... <c>I'm here to save you. Are you trying to sabotage my mission? <c>Think about Task Force DEFY. Are you giving up on them? <c>Waving your white flag already? There's still time to think!
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:We've all experienced failure. Most of the time, it's not due to our own fault that we fail. You've done very well. It's me...
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:They can make it out. Yegor won't treat T-Dolls as prey. I...
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:You can't grapple with the military indefinitely. I think it's time to put an end to this. Let me...
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<震屏>:What the hell are you saying, Ange? +If you give up, what are we going to do?
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:The commander will take care of you. You will have better opportunities to put your skills to good use.
NPC-AngeDamage(1);AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But you are our charge. If we fail to protect you, then we...
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AN94(4)||:I know you'll be devastated, but you can just have your neural clouds wiped—
NPC-AngeDamage(2);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Like what you did to the AR Team? You want to delete SOP-II's memories again? +How many more times do you want to die just to make us all forget you?!
NPC-AngeDamage(1)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:... +We're out of time. Get out of here. +Take all the combat records and the HOCs back with you... Avenge me...
