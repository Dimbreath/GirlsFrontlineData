()||<BIN>34</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>：Combat over. The AR Team has reached the database where File No. 7 is stored.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Miss Persica, Commander, we've entered the designated database.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>;RO635(0)||：Ohh... That's easier than expected.+So have you found File No. 7?
NPC-Persica(2);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：SOP-II has made it past the identity verification and is in the process of browsing through the files.+I'll release a signal to trick the mainframe into activating its security system when she establishes the connection.+Once File No. 7 is located, download will commence immediately.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：I see... Thank you so much.+Especially you, RO... You helped M4A1 achieve what she couldn't...
NPC-Persica(2);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I appreciate the praise, Miss Persica.+But I'm merely following orders. It's all thanks to the Commander and the AR Team.
NPC-Persica(2);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Besides, the operation is still ongoing. We can't let down our guards yet.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Uh... I thought you've already found the file?
NPC-Persica(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Downloading the file will take up a lot of SOP-II's RAM, and I won't be capable of acting independently once I enter the mainframe.+We will all be extremely vulnerable during this period except for M16.+S.F. can sniff us out anytime, so the Commander will have to keep buying us time.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：In that case...+RO, why not listen in on the Sangvis channel again?
NPC-Persica(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I do not recommend it. The anti-jamming system will keep running to facilitate the commander's maneuvers.+But hacking into Sangvis comms right now would make it possible for the enemy to reverse trace our location, especially when we don't know the extent of the enemy's technological capabilities...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Ugh... Well...you do have a point...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Sighs) I think you've had too much coffee. I suggest you go into mandatory sleep mode with the help of devices.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：RO, SOP-II has found File No. 7. We can start downloading whenever you're ready.+But there is a lot of data, and the file size is huge, so this is gonna take a while.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Stay here, M16, and don't do anything to alert the enemy scouts.+I'll leave everything outside to the Commander.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：What, feeling squeamish without me?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I'm merely making reasonable judgments based on the situation.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Haha, sure...+I'll stay here to protect you two. But as part of the deal, do NOT leave the database no matter what happens.+I'm speaking from experience. You'd better listen to me.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I have no idea where you got your experience...but fine. I promise I won't.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>：Alright, I'm leaving the rest to you, RO. +I think I really should...take a little nap...
