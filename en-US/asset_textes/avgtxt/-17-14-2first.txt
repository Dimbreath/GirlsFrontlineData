NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Wonderful! We did it! +Gager's stopped her pursuit. Commander, we ought to take this opportunity to rush over—
NPC-Kalin(0);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker><通讯框>||:Griffin Commander, surely you didn't think you had escaped my grasp?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Huh?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:...Click.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll A</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Commander, our echelon's been ambushed by hordes of Sangvis forces! We can't reinforce the rear echelons!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:What?! From where?!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Griffin T-Doll B</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Commander! We're being surrounded by Sangvis units! The enemy hasn't continued advancing, but now—!
NPC-Kalin(4);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Those were the reinforcements that Agent originally prepared for me. I simply deployed them ahead of time as ambushers. +Griffin Commander, most of your rear units are now surrounded by heavily-armed Sangvis units. They can open fire at any time. +The survival of your Dolls depends entirely on my mood...or do you wish to abandon them and flee on your own?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:... +We...we won't throw any of our Dolls away. +Don't think we can't beat you, Gager!
NPC-Kalin(4);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Oh, I don't doubt that. But upon how many Doll casualties will your victory be built?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Hey, wait a minute! That's way too underhanded to be your style!
NPC-Kalin(4);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:My current mission is to destroy all non-Sangvis units in sight. +I'm simply giving you a bonus opportunity.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:So...what exactly do you want?
NPC-Kalin(3);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Architect.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Eh?
NPC-Kalin(2);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:You still have Architect locked up on your side, right? +Give me her location. After I verify it, I'll immediately lift the encirclement. +If you have data on me, then you'll know that I don't lie.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:...Commander? +...Yeah, there's no way we can do it, but we have to try anyway.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Gager, Architect is currently imprisoned in a secret detention facility at HQ. +It's a Griffin internal secret, and we frontline personnel have nothing to do with it. +Of course, we can guarantee that she's still alive—
NPC-Kalin(3);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I told you already, give me Architect's location. That's the condition for freeing the hostages. +I don't care how you do it, find out right now!
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:But...we can't even contact our own superiors, to say nothing of a prisoner, so—
NPC-Kalin(3);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Well then, you'll be losing contact with the first batch of hostages right now.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:Please...please wait, let us try—
NPC-Kalin(4);BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's not the answer I want to hear. Do it—
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:...Whirrrr—! + ... + ...
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Eh? + Was there a blackout?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No...the comms were cut... +What on earth happened...? +Commander...what happened...to everyone...? +What...should we do...?
