NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Communications are recovering... +...Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? +As for the Military... Have they seized Mastermind yet...? +At the very least...please be alright, Ange...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>22</BIN><震屏>:Persica— +Hey, Persica!
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Ange! What happened to you?!
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Me? I'm fine, everyone's fine. +I just used some borrowed units to take a military comms station and took refuge inside.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Phew... +What on earth happened just now...? And...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Good news, the Military failed.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Eh?
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:According to some news I overheard, the Military's plan to hack Mastermind didn't work out. +While the reason was unclear, I'm sure something unexpected must have happened.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Does it have anything to do with the comms going down just now?
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:I don't know, and it's not important for now. +What matters is the Military's follow-up operation...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:Follow-up? Sorry, I can't think of anything yet...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:No, isn't it obvious what the Military is going to do next?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:What are you talking about...?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker></Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:...The sound of rumbling comes over Ange's channel.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Naturally...it would be the tanks at the area perimeter. +You heard that, didn't you? They're pushing in from the base of the mountain. +Once the tanks start rolling, our T-Dolls won't be able to stop them with their small arms.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:This isn't something I can take responsibility for. +But the Military must have learned Mastermind's location through their hacking attempt, and they're trying to physically seize her now.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:That's right, which is why we need to grab her first, using...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>22</BIN>:...Ange, you're right. You're a soldier, and I'm a scientist. +A soldier can sacrifice everything for their mission...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:Hey, don't make me out to be so heartless. I like those Dolls you gave me very much. +Everything's still within my calculations. I've got things under control. +I'll have 404 find Mastermind's position, but you also have to give me a hand.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BIN>22</BIN>:My coffee is ready. All that's left is luck on your part, Ange.
