()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><白屏1>:...+... Some time later.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2>:...Whum—!
()<Speaker>System</Speaker>||:The teleportation is complete. +Welcome back, Jill Stingray.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...+I can hardly believe I actually succeeded. Anna didn't close the gate! +But...dammit, why can't I remember anything... All I know is that at the end, I chose to abandon Anna's mission... +I hope everyone won't be disappointed with me... +No, that's impossible, I'm sure I disappointed them... +Wait a minute...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN>:...Jill looks out at this completely different mental world.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:This world... What happened... +Hey! Is anyone there!? Heeeey—! +...+What on Earth...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Just then, the sound of clumsy footsteps come from nearby.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Thank heavens, someone's here.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, you're...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_reminiscence</BGM>:Greetings, human friend. +Nice to meet you. My name is Elisa, and I am the avatar of Earth's AI.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-12(0)||:Shouldn't you be in the Earth Computer... +Oh right, the Earth Computer's gone.
Jill(2);BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Stella rebuilt Elisa. Alma upgraded Elisa's functions. Anna gave Elisa sufficient information. +Elisa is now linked to the entire world. She can freely manipulate this world.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-12(0)||:It sounds like I'm talking to a god...
Jill(2);BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:I have simply been asked by them to welcome you, Jill.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-12(0)||:Then where are they? Where are Dana and the others... Where are they now?
Jill(2);BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:...They are gone. +Everyone has vanished.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-12(0)||:...+ Why?
Jill(2);BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Sustaining the gate between two worlds required a tremendous amount of energy. +Since the Doll host in reality is about to awaken, there is no way this world can retain the necessary amount of memory required to operate the gate function. +Therefore, in order to free up the memory of this world, Elisa had no choice but to delete a part of the content of this world.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;BOSS-12(0)||<黑屏1>:What... +What have you done, Elisa...
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Elisa... +Deleted everyone. +Elisa has deleted everyone in the world.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...+Why... +Why did you do that!?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:This is Elisa's purpose. It was the reason Elisa was created. +Every deletion order was personally given by the targets in question... +Every Doll, every human in this world—
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:NOOOOO!!! +Elisa, give them back to me! I ORDER you to give them back!!
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Deletion orders cannot be rescinded. +Jill... +I am sorry...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I am sorry...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN>:...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:No... +I should be the one who should be saying sorry...Elisa... +Dammit... I...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Jill. +Everyone chose to do this because they knew you would come back.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:They did it for something that they weren't even sure would happen...
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<震屏>:"In case Jill gets cold feet at the last minute and decides to give her other self freedom, let's give her a place she can return to!"
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<震屏>:That's right! That's right! I abandoned everything in my future life to come back here! +All my friends are gone, and I didn't even get to see them for the last time! +Was the freedom I wanted so good that it was worth abandoning everything else for it!? +The freedom I wanted and the existence of this world... +I... +I'm not...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:You are crying.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Yes...I'm crying.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<震屏>:I'm crying because I'm a selfish piece of shit, because I can't do anything but cry! +Anna...should really have closed the gate right away...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Everyone stopped Anna from doing so, and they convinced her to come around. They believed that you would definitely come back.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:They believed in me... Why? This world is about to end... +Elisa...if they could have survived by deleting my other self, then I would have hardened my heart and done it.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Jill, think about it; why did you come back?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I wanted to see everybody one last time, I wanted to be with everyone... +My friends, my life, my beliefs... +Everything I had was given to me by this world, and I don't think I can live on without them... +But now...I have nothing, and even the existence of this world is...
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Jill, we have all truly existed. +Super-Shorty, Dana, Jericho, Stella, Sei... +Dorothy, Alma, Gr G28, and Anna... +Whether we lived in a simulated world, or were nothing more than a stretch of text in someone else's mind... +All of this definitely happened, in one way or another, so it cannot be erased.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...+Who told you to say that, Elisa?
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Anna. +She said Dana helped her think things through.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I'm guessing that Dana must have used her fists.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:(Smiles) They all used their fists. It was quicker that way. +Everyone wanted to save something; their friends, the citizens, and this world...but this destruction would still have come. +Everyone in this world failed, but they left with a smile on their faces... They knew that all this was not meaningless.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:And in the end, all I can leave to this world are useless tears.
BOSS-12(0)<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What you are leaving behind are not just tears, Jill...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:...They are also the last rain in the world. +They all knew, Jill. You...were worth it for them.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Boombrrum! Boombrrrum!
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:What's that sound?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:This world is asking us to return everything we borrowed from it— + —What is commonly known as "The End of the World". +The host is waking up. The real Anna will be free of her bindings, and everything will return to normal... +In a few more minutes, our aberrant world that was born of an accident will also vanish.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:This world isn't aberrant.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Then you should forgive yourself, Jill, because you have done nothing wrong. +The fact that you came back proves that the life you had in this world was not a mistake. +You liked this world, did you not?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:I... +Yes...this period of time, at least, was very happy for me. +Even if its last moments are worse than most, I think I still came out on top overall— At the very least, I won over that version of myself which was more real, right?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:All the choices that we can make will not make us happier... +...They will only let us travel further. +You have made your choice, Jill.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes... +And now, it's time to accept the answer.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN><SE1>AVG_Rain2</SE1>:...Boombrrum! Boombrrrum!
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:Jill?
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Hm?
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||:It is time.
()<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Mm... +Happy doomsday, Elisa.
()<Speaker>Elisa</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Happy doomsday, Jill. +"Enjoy the present day and the present time..."
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:...Beep—! +... +...
