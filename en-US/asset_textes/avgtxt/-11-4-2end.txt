UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:The signal seems to have led us in the right direction. The drone really is here... +45, I completed the mission! +(Laughs bitterly) Not that you can hear me...
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Please be safe, 45. I don't want to go back...to how it was...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Last chance, Gr G11. +I've already cleaned up the perimeter of the outpost. Time to give it everything you've got.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Ugh... You make it sound so easy. But with only me...
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:So I showed up right on time. +Hallo, little one. You on your own? +Oh dear...looks like you already have a date. I'm too late.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Let's get to business, Gd DSR-50. +Our target is that dog-shaped Sangvis Ringleader. Take it down, and the Dummies will stop as well, and we'll all be safe. +Now that you're free, make yourself useful.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Simultaneous shots. Can you do it?
DSR50(0)<Speaker>Gd DSR-50</Speaker><通讯框>||:You only have to ask.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:These new elite T-Dolls... I sure hope she's as dependable as 45 said. +Gr G11, can you make the shot yet?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't rush it. To avoid making the same mistake, I have to wait until Destroyer comes to a stop. +She's already slowed down considerably after all the fighting so I think she'll soon be out of juice. +Then...we'll just have to wait for her to stick out her big shiny eye...

BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Hey, Dreamer! I can't keep it up much longer! +Where the hell are your reinforcements?!
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>||:Oh dear... My forces are all busy defending the perimeter. +Don't worry, Destroyer, you're very close to completing your mission. +Keep running and don't let the sniper catch you.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:What now?! UMP45 still hasn't turned into a Sangvis unit as you promised, and I'm under heavy barrage here!
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Just get a bit closer. I can take care of the one in command if you just close in a bit.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:What are you talking about? Hasn't the plan to take control of UMP45 already failed?
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Well, UMP45... Heheh... +She IS a slippery one. She's keeping our connection open, so she must be up to something. +Whatever. We have a chance as long as the connection stays up.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:A chance? What chance?
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:If she's using the same protocol as ours, it's gonna make our job even easier... +Have you forgotten about our offensive firewall?
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:You mean...the thing that can simply fry a neural cloud...?
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:That's the gist of it in terms of theory. +I actually used every single idle server at the base for this. That little minx's neural cloud should've been burnt to a crisp by now.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:Oh, so we can now go get her corpse! +And capturing Squad 404 will only be a matter of time!
BossCerberus(0);BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:That's the only foreseeable outcome... +But...will it really be that easy...
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||:Who cares! Let me go check out the outpost she's at!
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:But...what's her exact location...? +Hmm...this body is very inefficient in multi-tasking. I'll have to stop and think about it...
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Destroyer comes to a stop.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Let me see...she should be...

()||<BIN>69</BIN><黑屏2>:They've activated the safeguard program. You know what that means, right?
()||:They're destroying our neural clouds. +So are we going to die here?
()||:No, only one of us has to die. The program will stop running as long as one of us dies.
()||:What...are you talking about?
()||:Hopeless, isn't it? But that's the fate of all Dolls. +Which do you choose, life or death? +Answer me, UMP45!
()||:Why...why does it have to be like this...
()||:Raise your weapon, UMP45. +Don't pity yourself. That's only for losers!
()||:...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Is that me in the past? Guess I can only access it this way... +If it can even replay that memory...then OGAS Protocol has some seriously scary computational capacity... +Still...switching back and forth is taking a heavy toll on me... Cough... +And these flashbacks don't seem very stable. Destroying the program won't be easy even with the help of OGAS.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Huh? What now?!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They spotted me even in such a small port... Damn S.F., are they trying to fry my neural cloud?!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:These attacks...are relentless!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm NOT gonna...fall here... 40...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2>:416 hailing. +9, have you found 45?
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:I found her. I'm right by her side.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:How is she?
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't know. She's just standing here, eyes wide open, like a statue. Zeele, Deele, what do we do?
HK416(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Zeele</Speaker><通讯框>||:Let's start by physically connecting her to the network with a cable. Any ideas, Deele?
HK416(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Deele</Speaker><通讯框>||:It looks like...she was under the attack of an offensive firewall. +S.F. might've tried to fry 45's neural cloud but she was disconnected on the last second so it didn't work.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:Humph. My last shot saved her.
G11(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Deele</Speaker>||:Other than the fact that she's still alive, I can't guarantee anything...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:All the echelons that were aiding us are also out of action. They're standing by in their last-active positions. +That's not good at all. S.F. will definitely send in new reinforcements and we're sitting ducks.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:We're really on our own with no T-Dolls who can issue commands. We've got to think of something.
G11(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Zeele</Speaker><通讯框>||:We aren't entirely out of options... +Damage to the neural cloud can be repaired on Level II, but the repair is usually carried out in a maintenance pod...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:Let me guess. Since we don't have a maintenance pod just handily lying around... +We have to risk being one-shot by S.F. and link up with her on the spot?
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Think about it. We can't make it out of the Sangvis barricade without 45's direction so we'll be dead either way.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:So...how do we wake her up?
G11(0);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Deele</Speaker><通讯框>||:We must first inspect the current state of 45's neural cloud on Level II before we can figure out how to repair her. +But we need your help. It's all on you, Squad 404!
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:We practiced this before we set off... +I hope you still remember how it's done.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Tsk... To be honest, I don't like that place.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Since when do you grumble so much? +You're becoming more and more like me.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Shut up!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, alright, get off each other's throat! +Let's bring 45 back and make it home together!
