？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...45? +Wake up! UMP45!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>70</BIN><黑屏2>:Hmm...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:How...long was I asleep?
UMP45(2);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Not too long. Sier told us your readjustments were complete and asked us to come get you, but...
UMP45(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But it's pretty interesting how you were sleeping with your eyes wide open. Never seen that on you before.
UMP45(2);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You looked like your system had crashed.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:... +I was just a bit disoriented from being disconnected abruptly... I don't think I managed to finish the battle.
UMP45(2);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:Apologies, Miss 45, but there was an emergency... +An unknown T-Doll's signal was suddenly detected while I was inspecting the network.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:A party crasher? Could it be Sangvis Ferri?
HK416(2);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker>||:No, it was a Griffin signal. A T-Doll must have accidentally stumbled into the network. +I'm guessing some new T-Doll must've connected through the wrong port when getting her enrollment authorization. +Dier probably mixed up the ports while he was spacing out.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;NPC-Seele(0)||:Then...we could be exposed anytime...
G11(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Nonsense! It was my mistake, alright, but it's not that serious. +Once she entered the network, the security protocol would've locked down her neural cloud due to her being unauthorized. +She wouldn't have been able to access anything and naturally has no chance of discovering you. Just relax!
G11(2);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hey, this is hardly reassuring! +If Griffin finds out a T-Doll's neural cloud has gone missing, they'll come asking questions sooner or later!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:...Can you find out who she is?
UMP45(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:I couldn't find a match from the database, so she's probably a new recruit. +But that doesn't matter! I'm gonna kick her out of the network. I just need some time to locate her. Now's your chance to rest up.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:... +Let's make the most out of the situation and try to find her in the network.
UMP45(2);NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker>||:Oh? You wanna make this part of the training?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Deele(0)||:We'll be searching for target signals anyway. There's no harm in getting some actual experience. +We can also acquire data about Griffin's newest T-Doll model and help you update your database while we're at it.
UMP45(2);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uh...so there goes my nap?
UMP45(2);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Is this really a good idea, 45? If we're exposed...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:The real operation will be much more dangerous than being exposed. Instead of worrying about the risks, we should think about how to go about it. +With me here, you guys just have to follow my orders, got it?
UMP45(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're precisely what I'm worried about, 45. We're all worried about your current condition.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Don't sweat it. I value myself more than anyone else, but there's really no need to worry for now.
UMP45(2);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Hmm, if that's what you believe, then let's be off!
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>72</BIN><黑屏2>:Locating a signal, huh... Guess we should start with collecting data regarding this party crasher's neural cloud.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:How exactly are we gonna do that?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:It's very simple actually... Just as how we used the camouflage key just now, we simply have to approach her and bring back the data. +Though it seems like her signal got smashed up so we'll have to find all the fragments.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Sounds like a drag... Can't we just bring one back?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:It's not like we can't, but that's horrible... +A T-Doll with missing neural cloud data is like a mentally-challenged human.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:It may just be another training, but don't let down your guard. Let's quickly find all the neural cloud data and bring them back.
