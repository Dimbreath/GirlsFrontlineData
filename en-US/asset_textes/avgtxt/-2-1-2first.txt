RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Guys, we're about to get to the outpost!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hey, over there!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Hey, that's a Jupiter, isn't it?! +They've got one even here?!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:BOOM!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Not just one... +I think we just happened to have crashed in a really bad place.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What the heck?! The cannon blew the outpost to smithereens! +Now what?!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Change of plan. We go around and keep moving! +Keep your eyes open. S.F. has already noticed our presence!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:We've been very careful the whole way. How did they find us?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:No clue. Perhaps the Ringleader here is something else.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:You mean there are other dolls like Dreamer?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't worry too much for now. Sangvis forces haven't completely surrounded us yet, which means they don't have our precise location. +Let's just change our course of action and go around first.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:There's a forest to the west. It may be safer to take cover in there.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Can't be helped. We'll have to give it a shot... +Helian said another freighter was shot down in this area. +We might be able to find resources and survivors on the way. Hopefully we'll make it in time... +Before we're discovered by this unfathomable Sangvis T-Doll...

BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Haha! Yes! I got it! +Bull's-eye! Bull's-eye!
Gager()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:It's early in the morning... Pipe down...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:So...what bull's-eye?
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey! Gager, look! +I just hit that communication outpost!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:... +And...why did you do that?
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hmm...no reason at all. +It was just situated on a super irritating spot and I felt like testing my aim, tee-hee!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Jeez... +Don't waste your OCD on such trivial matters. +If you have the time, why don't you search for Griffin survivors?
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh? There are survivors?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Your shell only grazed that aircraft. The probability that they managed to crash-land safely is extremely high.
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hmm... Since the data is from you... +But we're here to test these cannons, right? If both of us move out, who's gonna guard them?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I'll go look for survivors. You just stay here and keep the base secure... +And stop firing random shots. You might end up hitting friendly units.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, alright, I get it. +Then I'm leaving them to you. Move along!
