RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Understood, Commander. We will coordinate with the other echelons. Leave the assault to us. +Roger that. We await your orders.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Have you issued our objectives?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yes, we're all sorted here. +AR-15, is it really a good idea to let M4 go solo?
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's her decision, and we should trust our leader. +Besides, judging by the current situation, that is the best course of action.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I'm also a bit worried... +If what M4 told us really happens...won't she be in grave danger?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Lighten up. Her resolve is a lot stronger than it was.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, what happened after you connected with M4?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You really want to know?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Yeah. You two felt...different after you came out.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:It was nothing special, really. +We simply turned down some lousy invitations and witnessed a few distasteful moments.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:AR-15... +I don't think I get it...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...That's probably for the best. +Ignorance is bliss.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Fine... I never really care about such things anyway. +All I want is for all of us to stay together!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Right then, gunshots can be heard from the distance. +At the same time, all members of the AR Team receive an incoming transmission request.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点2>:...They're exchanging fire ahead of schedule. Something's not right.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I honestly didn't expect the Commander to come up with a plan to commandeer the armored train...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What's wrong with that? I quite like the plan! If we pull it off, we'll be able to make some huge fireworks!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm surprised you're still so optimistic... I'd count my blessings if we don't get turned into fireworks ourselves before we even get our hands on the train...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Looks like there's been a change of plan on 404's end. Prepare for battle.

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, this is the AR Team. The Griffin forces are all set. Squad 404 has also reached their position but requires support. How should we proceed? <c>Prioritize rescuing Squad 404. <c>Concentrate fire on breaking through the defenses of the armored train.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Prioritize rescuing Squad 404. +We can't take over the control system of the train without them.

AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:A decision that's very much your style, Commander.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood. Then I'll issue the order right away. +Operation Golden Fleece is go. +Charge!

RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Wait, what are you planning to do?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We are the most high-specced Dolls here. +So we must do what only we can do.
