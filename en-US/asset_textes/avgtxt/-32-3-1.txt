MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Wow...there are so many people.
MP446(0)<Speaker>Viking</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:That's why I didn't want to come here, it's so damn bothersome!
MP446(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:But there's nowhere else to go. All the shops and bars are closed, so we've got no choice but to — ah!
MP446(0);MP5(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:...Gr MP5 is suddenly tripped by a human.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Ah...sorry.
MP446(0)<Speaker>Viking</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Gr MP5, are you alright?
MP446(0);MP5(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The human woman stares at Gr MP5 and nods. She then helps her up and walks away.
MP446(0)<Speaker>Viking</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:What a strange native.
MP446(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...I think I've seen her somewhere before.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...The human woman continues to make her way through the crowd.
Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Parapluie infection successful... This module's functions are normal.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Stella, this is Crimson Rose. I'm in position.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Roger. Keep an eye on the situation. Report immediately if anything develops. +The last time I saw this many people was when the Prime Minister took office, and it was Mega Christmas to boot.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Indeed, but security now is very thin. It's full of holes.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:The White Knights haven't shown up, so it seems that Architect and Sei...have successfully delayed Jericho. +And the Prime Minister doesn't believe the Dolls will do anything out of the ordinary, which would be true, unless...
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Stella touches her electronic right eye.
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<SE1>Heartbeat</SE1>:Unless they were all mine.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>I can hear you breathe. You sound a little tense.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Oh? You could hear that in such a noisy place?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>How much did you spend to buy me? I told you before, I'm worth every penny.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:It's true that I am very nervous. Even I don't know what's going to happen after this... +I took advantage of my friend for this moment, so I can't fail. +Just in case, I'm going to ask you again; if I ordered you to shoot the civilian Dolls here, will you really do it without question?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Jeez. Let me say it again.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'm just a product. You bought me, so I'll obey all of your orders unconditionally. Do you want to try me out right now?</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:No, I don't want to mess up the plan, and I want to avoid that scenario if possible. +I'm sorry, I have full faith in you now.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>You really are too tense. Don't hang around in that crowd too long. You need to keep your breathing under control.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:You're right. Many Dolls here have perfume on; I'm not sure what brand it is, but there's diesel mixed into it. +Don't worry about me. Keep your eyes on the stage; the Prime Minister's going to show up soon.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Are you sure? Even the TV stations said that there was no way she'd make an appearance.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(3)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Do you believe those politicians or me?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(3)||:<color=#00CCFF>(Laughs) Doll politicians have got to be better than the human ones.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Politicians are politicians. They're all the same even if you appoint them from Seifar employees. +I'll say it again for you. My confidence comes from the S.F. module in my right eye. It can spread the Parapluie virus and infect every single Griffin Doll in the vicinity. +Every single Doll on this street and inside that big building will serve as my eyes and ears.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Well isn't that handy? Who would have known that the right eye that S.F. took from you would become the tool for controlling this entire world?</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I just want to save Griffin City. I'll pay any price to achieve victory.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>I should post those words of yours to Fatebook. I'm pretty sure you'll get a ton of likes after this is all over.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:By all means, but mind the angle this time around. +The picture last time...made my chest look a little big.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>The picture last time got the most likes of all—</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Hang on...she's coming. Our Prime Minister is about to show up.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Looks like you win, Stella.</color>
WA2000(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No, not yet.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
Dorothy(6)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_troubling_news</BGM><黑屏1>:Ladies and natives! Good Southern Hemisphere! +I am the Prime Minister of Griffin City that everyone knows and loves! +I am Dorothy, Dorothy Haze, the cutest of them all! I'm very happy to see you!
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<黑屏2><黑屏1>:...This victory only counts when I announce it myself.
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Dear citizens of Griffin City, every Doll, every human, every single screw and cell! +I know everyone's concerned about the weather around the globe, and I fully understand how you feel! +Therefore, tonight, I will be taking everyone's questions about the global sand rains in an open and sincere fashion in a public and live-streamed event. +Please believe me when I say that I will always have your concerns at heart, and I will devote all of my efforts from now on to solving everyone's problems!
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;Dorothy(0)||:Prime Minister Dorothy! (Raises hand)
G28(0);NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Human Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Hey, you can't come up here!
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)||:But I want to ask a question! And I want to see Prime Minister Dorothy!
G28(0);Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Uh...have I seen you somewhere before?
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;Dorothy(0)||:I-I'm Gr G28. I've interviewed you many times before! And I've done many part time jobs too, so for the next few hours, I'll be an intern reporter for The Augmented Eye!
G28(0);Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Alright, then I'll pick you, honey! +Come up here and ask me anything you want!
G28(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Dorothy(0)||:...Gr G28 walks up to Dorothy and shakes her hand.
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>;Dorothy(0)||:Thank you, Prime Minister Dorothy! +Uhm...I will be relaying everyone's suggestions. +According to the feedback from the citizens, nobody has seen anything being done about the sand rains over the past three years. May I ask how you intend to respond to their doubts?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Ahaha...solving a global problem like this...will take a bit of time.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Oh, that sounds nice, but we haven't seen your people do a single thing!
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Mr. K writes for the pet and baby section of our magazine, so he has a shorter temper than most.
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Human Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Mind your tone, Mr. Native!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:The hell you say?! You're a native too!
Dorothy(6)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Ahaha, don't worry, I fully understand the concerns of the native residents. +As you can see, I've even hired several natives as bodyguards. +I trust and understand humans very well, both psychologically and biologically...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What the hell is she saying...</color>
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:I know that the biological makeup of natives is too..."civilized", and I sincerely hope this doesn't come across as discriminatory, but I know that your requirements for living environments are stricter than most.
Dorothy(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Please don't play dumb! What we need is a proper answer!
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:Oh my, that's because we've been quietly working behind the scene. I'm not obliged to make everything I do public, right?
Dorothy(0);G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:But...Miss Prime Minister, the citizens elected you three years ago. +Do you think...making such a statement will please everyone?
Dorothy(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:I don't care who elected Dorothy, I didn't vote for her! +How could a Lilim with unknown origins be the Prime Minister!? And do you even know what her private life is like?
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker><Shake>||:I've had it! +Ever since the sand rains began to fall, I've been doing my best to solve them, and I've been putting up with all kinds of rumors! +But in the end, this sort of thing still happened anyway! Why is it that nothing I do can please everyone! Mr. Bodyguard, please escort him off the stage to cool off!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Human Bodyguard</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Mr. Native Reporter, please come this way.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>;NPC-Bodyguard1(0)||<震屏>:Dammit! Everyone, is this the outcome you want? +This city's on its last leg. What the hell are you people even doing?!
NPC-Bodyguard1(0)<Speaker>Human Bodyguard</Speaker>||:Please hurry and don't make trouble here—
()<Speaker>Human Bodyguard</Speaker>||<震屏>:—Aaaaaaaaarrrrrgh!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:What -!?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...The Doll reporter Gr G28 suddenly grabs the human bodyguard's arm and takes him down, then proceeds to subdue him with a textbook wrestling finisher.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||<震屏>:Miss Gr G28? You— +You know the "Walls of Jericho"?!
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:Eh!? Why did I suddenly do that to Mr. Bodyguard? I-I didn't do it on purpose!
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Miss Gr G28, you are disrupting the order of the venue and your public use of a wrestling finisher that is protected by the Native Act is a severe breach of human rights and is an act of discrimination! +My friend, please cease your perverted behavior immediately!
G28(0)<Speaker>Gr G28</Speaker>||:B-But I can't move! I'm innocent! My work doesn't put me into contact with wrestling moves!
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Please don't blame her. I ordered her to do it.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_march_of_the_white_knights</BGM>:...A human woman steps out of the crowd onto the stage.
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:You... You're...
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker>||:Stella? You're still alive!?
Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Good Southern Hemisphere, everyone. +I am Stella Hoshii, and it is an honor to meet you.
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker><Shake>;Stella(0)||:S-Stella—!
Dorothy(3);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:That's right, I'm still alive.
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:Y-You guys! Help me catch her!
Dorothy(3);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't think you'll be able to escape, you little Lilim! +To the Dolls gathered here today, I sincerely apologize for my act of disgrace in advance.
MP5()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<震屏><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:What's happening!? My body—!
海盗()<Speaker>Viking</Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏>:It's the Parapluie virus! We've been infected!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...All of the Dolls present fall under Stella's control and rush onto the stage to subdue the human bodyguards.
Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<BIN>166</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:Miscalculated, haven't you, little Dorothy? If you had a few more immunized White Knights by your side, perhaps you might have been able to hold out a while longer. But you employed native bodyguards to curry favor with the people, yet they do not have the right to do anything to the Dolls. +Everyone, is this fairness and freedom? Are these shallow acts really enough to gain your sincere approval?
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:Uuu... You! What are you up to!?
Dorothy(2);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I'm going to reveal your true face! +You took Alma and hid the Earth Computer!
Dorothy(2);Stella(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Stella steps onto the podium and approaches Dorothy.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:Alma? The Earth Computer? I don't know where they are!
Dorothy(2);Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Sorry, but I'll be the judge of that.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(0)||:Wh-White Knights! Hurry up and restore order!
Stella(0)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Do it, Crimson Rose!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:...Bang! Bang! + Gunshots from afar instantly pierce the critical modules of several mechanized White Knight units rushing up from behind, and they fall apart on the spot.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Eh!? What happened!?
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>All targets eliminated, Stella. It's a three-star victory. </color>
Stella(3)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>;WA2000(0)||:You really are worth your price tag. I shouldn't have expected anything less of one of Griffin City's "Grim Reapers". I apologize for my discourtesy earlier.
Stella(3);WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Anyone who comes across that name would think some middle-schooler came up with it, which is precisely why we're so dangerous.</color>
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>;WA2000(0)||:Give up, Dorothy. I'm not here for your life!
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:But what you're going to do is pretty much the same as killing me!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>RunStep</SE1>:...The Prime Minister turns and flees into the City Hall building!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Stella, there's a large mass of White Knights rushing this way from behind. It's up to you now.</color>

Stella(3);WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Exactly how many Griffin Dolls do you have under your control?</color>
Stella(3)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>;WA2000(0)||:I can give orders to as many of them as I want. This is a module augmented by 16Lab technology.
Stella(3);WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>This will be the wildest moment in Griffin City history...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Stella, our little Prime Minister fled into her HQ. This will be a hard fight. </color>
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>;WA2000(0)||<黑点1>:That's fine. I'll root her out and reveal her true identity... +The farce in this city must be cleared up before doomsday descends upon us!
