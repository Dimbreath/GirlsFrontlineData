BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Hey! The power is out again?! +But don't celebrate just yet! I've found the command for the auxiliary power already!
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:... +Uh, I can't really see during nighttime! +Let me find a light switch first!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is our chance! Retreat!
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? We're not going in while she's confused?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Our objective isn't to infiltrate the base. We'll be in danger once the power comes back online.
M1887(0)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>6</BIN><Night>:I see the power has been cut off, 45. Nicely done.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sangvis signal... +Who is this, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tactical Doll M1887, our informant. +She has a low-level Sangvis signal, which she's been using to aid us covertly. +And just so you know, the AR Team is also with her.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Tee-hee. Since both sides make use of Sangvis signals, our communications are completely off the radar.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Who'd have thought...that we're not the only ones who have mastered this trick.
M1887(0)<Speaker>M1887</Speaker><通讯框>||:It's merely an expedient. +You have bought time for the AR Team to slip away, but the battle is still underway. +Please keep distracting Architect. This is the only way for us to throw Gager off our trail.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We're not very well-stocked ourselves, 45. How long is this operation gonna last?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Not too long, 416. +I have a different plan...
