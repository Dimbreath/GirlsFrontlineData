()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...In the streets.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Griffin entourage is moving through the streets in careful formation. +Other than the Infected who are oblivious to their own tragic fate, the battlefield is littered with broken bodies. +RO635 guns down another batch of ELIDs, then notices something all of a sudden.

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 gestures at her teammate to keep quiet and stay close, then she moves cautiously to a pile of rubble. Behind a metal panel sprinkled with bullet holes, she finds a distraught Doll, clutching at her chest and shivering uncontrollably. +Before her lies the remains of an Infected blasted beyond recognition.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are...you okay?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The gray-haired Doll doesn't reply.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you a Griffin Doll? +Are you part of the surveillance team that we lost contact with...? We have some new recruits on this operation... You're HS2000, aren't you? I've read your file.
HS2000(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girl lifts her head, showing a face full of fear...and shame.
HS2000(1)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... I-I'm so scared... +He... That man...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HS2000(1)||:...Where are your teammates?
RO635(2);HS2000(1)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:They...for me... I'm...I'm sorry... I was too scared... +I didn't know how to respond to the situation... My neural cloud was completely blank... I couldn't move...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HS2000(1)||:Calm down. Look at me.
RO635(2);HS2000(1)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:If I could fight properly, my teammates wouldn't have... +But...I'm just a Medical Doll...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HS2000(1)||:I didn't see so many dead bodies on my first mission - I was a lot luckier than you. +Which is why you, whose first mission is to repel ELIDs on the battlefield, are so much braver.
RO635(2);HS2000(1)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:But...I...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HS2000(1)||:You're facing enemies that shouldn't have been yours to face - this courage alone is commendable. +So stop blaming yourself. What matters now is to survive.
RO635(2);HS2000(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||:HS2000 looks up. Beyond her initial panic, RO635 now sees a glint of surprise and gratitude in her eyes.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HS2000(1)||:I suppose you don't want to suddenly find yourself back at the base in a brand spanking new body with no memory of what has happened before, right?
RO635(2);HS2000(1)<Speaker>HS2000</Speaker>||:I...don't want that...
RO635(2)||:RO635 looks around vigilantly and claps HS2000 gently on the shoulder.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Then try not to get hit. Just survive for now, okay? +Now that you've rejoined our main force, let's all do our best to go home without a scratch.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:With a wavering gleam in her eyes, HS2000 finally nods at RO635. +She gets on her feet unsteadily and jogs over to the group of Griffin Dolls.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 gets up and walks away once she's made sure the Doll has settled in.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If I could help it, I really wouldn't want these girls to experience something so cruel.
