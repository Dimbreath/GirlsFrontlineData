()||:...Task Force DEFY has finally found the mark left by the rescue team!
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Surpriiiiise! +Ahahaha! We finally found you, DEFY!
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:If your movement had been just a little swifter than your utterance, I would have identified you as a hostile target and attacked.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Sorry, this is M4 SOPMOD II of the AR Team. SOP-II, meet AK-12 and AN-94 of Task Force DEFY. I'm 416. You've all met me.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I do not particularly want to see you again, but it cannot be helped.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Right, this isn't the time to deepen our bond. Let's get straight to the point - where is Ange, and how is she?
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...AN-94 looks behind her and finds an unconscious Ange draped on AK-12's back.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange...she—
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:A few minutes ago...she took a heavy dose of radiation and passed out. +It took us a while to find the mark, but her life isn't in danger. However, she'll be sitting out the coming battles. It'll be just us.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What a shame. Guess I'll have to say hi some other time. +Still, it's not "just us". We also have the Commander and the HOCs.
AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:What...HOCs?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Our new toys! They're giving us long-range support and specialize in fighting tanks! You'll love them!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Then we're safe for now. Let's figure out what to do next.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:The contamination index is significantly lower here. Though Ange is not entirely out of danger, her life is not under any immediate threat.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Then let's keep moving to less contaminated areas. At this rate, Ange isn't going to last much longer.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hmm? Who was that?
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Oh, don't mind me. Just making a suggestion—

AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE1>Gunfight</SE1><SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Military units! They're heading straight toward us!
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:There is an abandoned trench just ahead. Get Ange in there first!

AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hurry up! We're here!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:HOCs, give us cover!
()||<BIN>157</BIN><黑屏2>:...Under the HOCs' suppressive fire, Task Force DEFY makes it into the trench safely.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We still have loads of cards up our sleeve. Don't worry, we can handle these tanks!

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-YegorDamage(0)||:He knew we'd come here... He counted on the fact that this is the only route to the Green Zone!
