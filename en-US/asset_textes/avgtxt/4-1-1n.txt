()||<黑屏1>:...+......?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>8</BIN><Night>:Who?!+Who's there?!
()||:...
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:I'm Assassin of Sangvis Ferri.+Commander of Griffin, your time is up.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Humph...+Save it. If you really were Sangvis, you'd have died before you could run your mouth.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:If I really were Sangvis, I wouldn't have given you time to even open your mouth.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:At least lock the door when you're on duty.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:(Shrugs) What's there to fear with you watching my back?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Don't let your guard down, Miss Commander.+All personnel assigned to you this time are notorious punks, present company included.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:You're very dependable as an adjutant. We may have worked together only for a couple of days, but I have no doubt about it.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Why, thank you. But compliments will get you nowhere.+You still have much room for improvement, Commander. Work hard, okay?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Well, it's only for this one-off operation.+And stop calling me Commander. I'm just a T-Doll with temporary authorization.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Whatever. You're in command in any case.+Enough with the small talk, RO. Wash your face and wake yourself up.+There's been new development in the search for Document 36. Time for you to make your decision.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sighs) Okay. I'll make some coffee. Keep going.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:Our teammate found a lead here, but she triggered a Sangvis alarm and is having trouble slipping away.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Tell her to standby where she is. You go get her. I'll cover you.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:How decisive of you. Not gonna observe the situation a bit longer?+This place is prowling with Sangvis forces. Perhaps we should wait for Makarov to come back with directives from the higher-ups...?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:The local human residents have been evacuated, while Sangvis forces haven't completely occupied the area. Now is our only chance.+We can't afford to wait for Makarov. Grab Document 36 and run for it.+But who's the teammate in question?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Who do you want it to be?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Anyone who's reasonably reliable, really. I don't want this to be a fool's errand...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Then sorry to disappoint...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:10 out of 10 in terms of bad news?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Maybe a 7.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:(Shrugs) Fine. I'll just treat it as a rescue mission...+Everybody listen, our target this time is the Sangvis command post in the area. We are to give our companion a chance to escape.+All right, Griffin, prepare to move out!
