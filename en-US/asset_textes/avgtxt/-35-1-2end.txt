()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>6</BIN><黑屏2>:At the entrance of the Griffin base.
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:There. All cleaned up.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Gr MG5 lets out a sigh as she drags a T-Doll sprawled on the snow back on her feet.
MG5(2)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:Get up. Are you this tired just from cleaning up some fodder?
OC44(2)<Speaker>OTs-44</Speaker><Position>0,-150</Position>||:Then can we finally start preparing our presents for real?
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:We already have a clear idea about our gift!
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Really? Tell me... No, I suppose it'd be better to come up with something on my own...
CZ75(2)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:Why do I have a feeling I'm going to draw Spitfire's gift...
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:I've already decided to give away my beloved collection of cola. I wonder what I'm going to get in return?
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||<黑点1>:I just hope I won't get your cola...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><黑点2>:... Behind a shady corner near the Griffin base.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||:Did you hear that, Gager?! +They... they're having a Secret Santa! +What is that? It sounds really interesting...
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||:Any doll who prepares a gift can participate?! +Then I, too—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gager smacks the eager and restless Destroyer on the head, sending her into the snow.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:I see that your intelligence is also astounding.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:Destroyer pulls her head out of the snow and sees a few modified Dinergates wandering among the Griffin T-Dolls. 
OC44(2)<Speaker>OTs-44</Speaker><Position>0,-150</Position>||<黑点2><BIN>6</BIN>:These Dinergates are so cute! They're pretty helpful too...
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:They ARE surprisingly useful...
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Say, if Sangvis Ferri sent in some Dinergates of their own today, we probably wouldn't be able to tell them apart, ahahaha...
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You're telling weird jokes again, M21...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><黑点2><黑点1>:Hold on, I just came up with the perfect plan.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:... Meanwhile.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... Next to the chimney of the Griffin base.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:(Dozing off) Wow... everyone's putting a lot of effort into making their presents! +Jeez... making gifts or whatever isn't cool at all...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:ART556 watches all the busy T-Dolls around her and falls into deep thought.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:If you ask me, the coolest thing has to be the mysterious thief who gets all the presents without having to work for them! Hahaha!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Thus, an exciting show begins to unfold.
