Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Commander, I'm sure you've had your own suspicions.+The Sangvis invasion in Area S09 is by no means a random conflict.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:A Sangvis Ringleader is in fact searching for a T-Doll known as M4A1.+She is part of the AR Tactical Unit under Griffin and has been collecting some research data under the commission of Persica, researcher at 16Lab.+According to our sources, her neural cloud, i.e. memory bank, seems to be carrying extremely important confidential intelligence.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点1>:M4A1 is currently lost in Area S09. We must bring her in safely with all possible haste.+But due to certain agreements, we cannot openly interfere with the situation.+After some discussion, Griffin HQ has decided to delegate this mission to you.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:Launch an immediate search in Zone T6, Area S09 and secure M4A1 before Sangvis forces get to her.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:The Ringleader in the area has been confirmed to be Model No. SP524, an advanced T-Doll widely known as 'Executioner'.+Though she is currently hellbent on chasing one target, she'll still attack if approached rashly. Please exercise caution.
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Occupy the enemy's command post, disrupt their communication channel, and find M4A1.+This mission is of utmost importance, Commander. The higher-ups at Griffin expect much from you.+Don't let them down. Now begin.
