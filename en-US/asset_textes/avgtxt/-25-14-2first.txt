()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>151</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:Where are we going?
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Griffin's new headquarters. A base bigger and better than the old one. +I hear the construction was sponsored by the organization behind 16LAB. We'll get even better treatment from now on.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Those enemies will not let up. We won't have too much free time to enjoy them.
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:At least we got out of this predicament. We're leaving Sangvis Ferri, the Military, and this battlefield behind. +Once the Commander comes back, we can turn over a new leaf.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But where's the Commander?
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Didn't you say there's a rescue mission? The Commander wants to rescue one last person.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...I know who that is. +But it's got nothing to do with me now.
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:True, welcome to Griffin.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:However, 416 believes that she will adapt to the new Griffin and the new future. +...What matters now is to bid her past farewell.
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Oh, aren't those your teammates over there? +Are they looking for you?
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:UMP9... +And Gr G11... +Their transport is here to pick up UMP45. They won't look for too long.
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I know you're sad, but we've already lifted off.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't regret my decision. +I fulfilled my end of the bargain. My departure is only a matter of time. +All is as agreed. They know that.
()<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You still owe them a farewell.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<白屏1>:...If there are no goodbyes, they won't miss me. +...If we don't miss each other, we'll know everyone is safe and sound.

()||:She used her leg this time - or rather, a weapon in the shape of a leg. +I'm starting to miss when she was using her arm. Of course, I didn't enjoy it in the slightest, but it was certainly a lot gentler than this. +My stomach heaves and I hurl up its contents. I can see what these cold-blooded puppets have been feeding me for the last two months... +I stare at the vomit and blood on the floor, but I've got to admit - I was asking for it. I should've come up with a better story.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Now, amend your account. +We know what happened to 416, but we need to find out where she has gone. Your answer must coincide with the subsequent events.
()||:Look on the bright side... +At least I managed to buy a bit more time again, though I'm not sure how much my body can still take. +My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing... +Or at the very least...a bit more credible.
