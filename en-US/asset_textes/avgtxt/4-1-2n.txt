92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:RO, I've reached the destination. About to meet up with her any second now.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Good. Let me see who on earth...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;92type(0)||:Merci! Merci!+I knew you wouldn't just leave me, Mademoiselle Type92!
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:...+If you call this a 7, what's 10 for you?
AAT52(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:10 is if we came too late and all there's left to rescue was a squashed tomato.+And if we go by common sense, a squashed tomato can't spit out any information.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;92type(0)||:Non, non, even a tomato that hasn't been squashed can't speak!+Uhh wait... You're talking about me?
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:（(Sighs) At least tomatoes don't talk nonsense and have us running after things like butterflies and taxis...
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>;92type(0)||:Hey! I really found actual information this time, alright?!+Listen, I know where Document 36 is!+It's currently in the safekeeping of a human that has stayed behind!
AAT52(0);92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:A human that has stayed behind? ...Are you sure you're not mistaken?+All human residents have been evacuated. That's why we could slip in to look for you.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:No... It actually is possible.+A few humans have gone missing during the evacuation. Judging by the information, these people couldn't have missed the evacuation notice.+They must've stayed behind deliberately to move those documents before Sangvis Ferri made it here...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Then it gets tricky. Even if we find them, we can't just fight them for the document.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Uh... Why can't we?
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:Have you forgotten, RO?+Unless given special permission by a superior, Griffin automatons can't exercise violence of any kind against any human being.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||:Not even verbal abuse!+Bien sûr, if they request this kind of service, we are more than welcome to deliver it.
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:What? Don't tell me you don't know about that...
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Ah... Working at Griffin still takes some getting used to...
92type(0)<Speaker>Type92</Speaker>||:I know. You came back not long ago, after all. There must be many things you're unfamiliar with.+You returned just for Document  right? Don't get too excited and botch it.
RO()<Speaker>RO</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I know what I have to do.+First things first, find the human in possession of Document 36. We'll deal with whatever comes next.
