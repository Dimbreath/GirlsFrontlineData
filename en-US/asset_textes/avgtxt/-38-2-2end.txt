()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Once upon a time, there was a kingdom of pasta. +In that kingdom lived a prince who loved pasta. +He would eat it every day. However...there was only one fork in the whole kingdom. The prince who always, always ate with the same fork thought... +"It would be nice to use a different fork sometimes..." +And so he began his quest for another fork.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>Isn't that the story of the picture book that Cano was reading?</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>Some kind of note the account user left behind?</color>
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_16</BGM><BIN>265</BIN><黑屏2>:We wiped out all the bad guys!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I expect nothing less from you, Cano. What a clean job.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:(Pants)
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Angelica, are you alright?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Signore Marco... I was just trying to recall this name...but my body started doing that on its own... +Signore Marco, have I forgotten something important again? +And this gun in my hand... Why does it feel so reassuring? +I don't think I've ever seen you in my life...
()||:Angelica stares at the weapon in her hand, and tears start streaming down her face.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:There must be something I've forgotten! Please tell me!
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:How can a Cyborg forget her own Handler? Signore Giuseppe, you must tell her everything that happened.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Henrietta's Voice</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Angelica.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Signore Marco?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're right, this IS the first time we've met. +I have never seen a girl of such talent in fighting.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:However, that gun isn't something you should use. +I'm sorry for giving you an unpleasant experience.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:B...but...Signore Marco.
()||:I take the weapon away from Angelica and pat her gently on the head. +The police siren draws closer to the scene and the police rush out from their cars. I fish out my ID right away. +Seeing that I'm with the Agency, the armed police officers finally relax around me. +Then I get a phone call from the Agency. I explain the situation briefly and receive the instruction to return immediately.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:This little girl is a civilian caught in the attack. Please take care of her.
()<Speaker>Police</Speaker>||:Yes, sir.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Let's go, Cano. I'm afraid the sequel to your picture will have to wait.
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Hmm...can't be helped. Um, Signore Marco, can I go and say goodbye?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sure.
()||:Cano runs up to Angelica and starts shaking her hand enthusiastically.
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:You were amazing! You really helped me out back there! +If it weren't for you, Signore Marco would've been dead! I really can't thank you enough!
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:U...um! If it's possible, may I have that picture book, please?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:You mean "The Prince of the Kingdom of Pasta"?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Yes... For some reason, I can't stop thinking about it...
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Heheh, it's yours then! +I hope you like the story, too!
()||:With that, Cano shoves the book into Angelica's arms and skips back to me.
()||:Angelica stares blankly at the picture book for a long while, then looks up suddenly as if something just occurred to her.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Excuse me, will we see each other again?
Carcano1891(2)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:If you like that book, I'm sure our paths will cross again some day!
()||<白屏1>:The car sent by the Agency to collect us is here. I get in with Cano, who keeps waving at Angelica through the window. +As the car drives away, the scene starts fading out. I realize the story has come to its conclusion.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:She really loved the story, so we kept making it longer and longer. +I don't believe everything I did back then was for nothing, even though she no longer remembers the story. +Perhaps forgetting everything is the only way she can have true happiness. Happiness which people who have abandoned her — like me — have no part in; happiness that is entirely her own. +Her parents might be unforgivable scum in the original world, but at least they love her more than anyone else here. +Which is why it's enough to leave this story behind. I just want her to live on as an ordinary girl.
()||<黑屏1>:This is the last story I can write for her.
