DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Alright, stop.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:(Pants) +How about now, Miss Desert Eagle?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Your singing, dancing and accompaniment...
()<Speaker>Idols-To-Be</Speaker>||:...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Are all perfect. Congratulations, girls. You're ready to take the stage.
()<Speaker>Idols-To-Be</Speaker>||:Woohoo!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:You're scheduled to perform tonight, right? I'll be there. +I'm looking forward to your show, ladies.
()||:Desert Eagle leaves. +P38 slumps bonelessly down into a sitting position.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:What's wrong, P38? Are you alright?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm, I'm fine... But I'm super nervous... I mean, it's tonight! It's happening tonight, what will we do if something goes wrong?!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Don't be too tense... If you're worried, why don't you get some rest? Go charge yourself up and prepare for tonight.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I feel that will be very necessary.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Al-alright... No, I need to believe in myself a little more. +I'm the lead singer for this show... I need to put my best foot forward! The most foolish thing I can do before a live show is to be frightened of making mistakes!
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:...
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:W-what's wrong?
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:It's nothing... You've changed though, P38. +You've got the look of a lead singer now, you know? You were really captivating just now.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑点1>:What the heck... Anyway, see you tonight, I'll be heading back for now!
()||<黑点2><Night><BIN>4</BIN><BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:That night. +After an intense battle, the tired Dolls trudge back to Griffin. After being screened at the base checkpoint, they slowly head for the repair bay. +Just then, the lights along their path suddenly come on.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:The lights over here shouldn't be on now, right?
ZastavaM21(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:Are they voice-activated now?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Doesn't look like it... Wow, look at that!
ZastavaM21(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:I see people standing on the platform in the grass patch... It's Gr HK45, Spectre M4...and who's that all the way in front?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:I can't tell, but she looks kind of familiar...
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As their colleagues look at them, the three execute a graceful bow. +Then, the Doll in the center picks up the mic and begins a tender song.
P38(2)<Speaker>Mysterious Singer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Moon</BGM>:Looking down on the streets from the highest place... Things like tears and sadness will soon vanish. +The birds, the wind, and light are all my friends... +I'll take my dreams far away, far away, however far.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:...Did the Commander invite a singer over? +She has a lovely voice.
ZastavaM21(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:I've heard this song before. +But the original singer never made it sound so soothing and gentle.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:So you're saying it's bad?
ZastavaM21(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:No, not at all. At least, right now, it feels good to me.
P38(2)<Speaker>Mysterious Singer</Speaker>||:I want to flap my wings and fly so free in the blue sky in my heart.
ZastavaM21(0)<Speaker>Zas M21</Speaker>||:"Far away blue sky... The sky goes on into tomorrow..."
()||:At some point, the Dolls hurrying past because of work have all slowed down, and the idle Dolls have been drawn over. +One of the Dolls plugs the sound into the Griffin PA system, and the gentle croon fills the entire base.
