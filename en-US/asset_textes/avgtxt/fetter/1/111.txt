P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Can we put this junk in the corner?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:It would be better on the shelves, right? +Come, I'll empty this side out~
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:You're amazing, Gr HK45! Is this a necessary quality for idols too?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, if you want to take part in talent shows, you need to learn all sorts of things, you know.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I've got a long way to go...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Aw, don't say that. There's a difference between idols and singers. +Whew... Now we've made room!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:We'll raise up the area close to the shelves and use it as a dance stage, and put the lights on top of the shelves... +That should work.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Oh, there's one more thing. +Don't you think we're missing a very important thing in our prep work?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:A...very important thing?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:We haven't named our venue yet!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Does a venue need a name? We don't even have a name for ourselves...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:It's not the same thing. We can have all kinds of fancy names, but there needs to be a special significance to this venue. +If we take everything seriously, we'll have an easier time getting the outcome we want.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:What you say does make sense... But what should we call it?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:We'll leave that to Miss Center Stage here!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I...hm... +I want to shine brightly, like the stars in the sky. +So why don't we call this place "Where Stars Are Born", or the "Star Chamber"?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:The Star Chamber, that sounds really cool! It's just like what a major label would call it. Let's go with that, then. Hm... "Star Chamber"... Got it, and now we just need to hang it up... I can't reach it!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll help you up. Be careful, okay.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN><关闭蒙版>:P38? Did you hear what I just said?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I did, I did! I was just thinking.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Picking a group name is very important, but you don't have the luxury of taking your time to think it over! +We'll be advertising the event tonight, so hurry up and make up your mind now.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I know. "If we take everything seriously, we'll have an easier time getting the outcome we want." +Hm... We're rising stars, so our group will be called...
