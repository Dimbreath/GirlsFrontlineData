P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Looks like someone uploaded the video onto Griff-chan...
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I saw it, it got a ton of likes! +MDR said she'd like us to join the live broadcast, P38! Us!!!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yeah, I got the message too... +We did it... We did it, Gr HK45, Spectre M4!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:We really did it! +I can hardly believe it, though I've always been very eye-catching myself.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hey! Still, that IS true. +Thank you, Gr HK45. If you hadn't come that day, things might not have ended up like this...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Hey, I was just doing my part for a singer I liked. No need to stand on ceremony. If you want to thank me, why not support me on the late night radio show?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yes, I will. I'll go tonight.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Aw, no need to be so serious. +I'll be counting on you for future shows, then. Let's work together, Apprentice Witch, and... "Spectre"?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Don't just decide my stage name like that! It doesn't stand out at all!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:But it does suit your style, doesn't it?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Okay, so it does, but it's really annoying to have to admit it!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:That was a good performance.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Ack! Miss Desert Eagle!? When did you...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I just arrived. You were too noisy and didn't hear me approaching.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I, I'm sorry...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:There's no need to apologize. I saw the whole thing, and while you seemed a little tense at first, on the whole it was very well done.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hehe, that's all thanks to your teachings...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I simply showed you the way. However skilled a polisher might be, she still needs a worthy gem to make it shine.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I feel embarrassed when you say that...but we'll do our best!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I believe in all of you.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:A compliment from our mentor has completely wiped away all the fatigue from the show. +The high fees we paid to hire a veteran like you were truly worthwhile!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Fees?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Huh?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:You were saying something about fees?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...How did you know that we needed help?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Stechkin told me. +She said you needed help putting on a show, so I came over right away.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Ah, and you didn't ask for an appearance fee or anything?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:We're all fellow colleagues in Griffin, why would I ask for such a thing? +...What's with that look on your faces?
