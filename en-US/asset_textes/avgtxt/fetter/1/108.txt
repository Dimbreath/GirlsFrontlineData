()||:It's late at night in the Star Chamber, but the lights are still on.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Stop.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:(Pants) +Was...it good...this time round?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Better than before, but still not a pass. +I told you, think of the direction where I'm standing as where the audience is. Now do your best to present yourself as relaxed and comfortable to me. Lengthen and draw out your body lines. +Gr HK45, you did a decent job, but the look on your face looks too forced. You can do better. +Same goes for you, Spectre M4. The backup performers might not be standing in the front, but you can't half-ass your pose and stance either.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Alright... Let's do it again!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:No, let's stop for now. You're all tired - let's take a break before continuing.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:But, we don't have time...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Listen to me, P38. +You need to be in top form to put on a show. Pushing yourselves too hard will lead to the opposite of that.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Got it...
()||:As she watches the tired trio, Desert Eagle falls silent for a moment, then beckons to them.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Come on, I'll buy you all a drink.

P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN>:Uh... I thought we were going to the Griffin Café. What is this place?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:The Griffin Café does have live shows sometimes, but we can't always be sure about that.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I see, so that's why we came to the city. I've heard of this bar before - they say people often do performances here.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Yes, I used to come here often. While there are quite a lot of rookies, some old hands come down here to practice, so you'll be able to learn a lot. +Go on in. It's on me today.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Really?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:I never joke about such things, P38.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Sorry!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<黑点1>:It's fine. Now head on in.
()||<黑点2><BIN>87</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The bar's interior is well-lit, and the people inside go back and forth in an orderly manner. The passionate singing from the stage echoes off the high, vaulted ceiling. +Desert Eagle leads the idols-to-be to an empty table and orders three glasses of fruit tea.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:This is my first time in a place like this...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Relax, we're customers now. +Just enjoy the show.
()<Speaker>Singer On Stage</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>10005</BGM>:Now nobody can escape from the terror again... +And again we try to hide our hope... +Our audience below the stage... +But we will never give up, you know! +You can't erase our inner flame! +Every time I look up—
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:She's amazing...
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:How is she amazing?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:She's stirring up the mood of the entire place. +Even though she's standing so far off to the side, I can't see anything wrong with her posture...
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Same goes for her backup dancers. They're energetic and passionate, and they worked the audience members in the mosh pit into their routine.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:And their backup... I need to remember how they did their backup singing.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:How do you think they learned those skills?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I guess they trained for a really long time?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:That group on stage fought in the S11 battle.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:You mean...she was there at the Great Retreat?!
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Yes. She's an ex-military who retired after that battle.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:...
()||:P38 unconsciously reaches for her gun, but realizes she didn't bring it out with her.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:She's not an enemy anymore, P38. Right now, she's just a performer with a troupe of her own.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:But... +...I get it.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Can you hear it? The feelings in her song... +She poured her experiences and thoughts into her creations, and she sang them over and over again, day in and day out.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:So her songs are so moving because she put her feelings into them... That's how humans do it.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Dolls can do it too.
HK45(2)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...I understand.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:What do you understand?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:What do you think the heart is, P38?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:The heart...you mean our neural cloud? +It's the foundation of our thinking.
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:That's what the "human heart" is too. +Our neural clouds were made in imitation of the human brain. They aren't a perfect imitation, but at the very least they can record memories.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Memories... My factory settings and my memories have combined to make the person that I am now... +Just like...how she went through war?
DesertEagle(0)<Speaker>Desert Eagle</Speaker>||:Memories are rooted in the neural cloud. They spring from life, then you take them in and incorporate them into your experiences. +To us, the contents of our neural cloud are our treasure. In that respect, we're very similar to humans. +What truly shines isn't our appearance, but our heart. +Different moods and experiences can color a performer in completely different ways. +And the thing that will actually draw in the audience is the light you give off with each note of every song you sing and each step of every dance you perform.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:It's just like how my songs sound best when I'm singing in my room... I'm good at a cappella songs because my heart longs for something like that... +I get it now, Miss Desert Eagle! I know what you're trying to tell me!
()||:Desert Eagle smiles and nods.
()<Speaker>Singer On Stage</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We have no time to wait, get up now— +I'm not gonna die here, that's what I'm fighting for!
