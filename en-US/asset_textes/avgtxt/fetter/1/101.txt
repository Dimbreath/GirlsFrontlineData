()||<Night><黑屏2><BIN>18</BIN><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:In front of a certain door in the Griffin dorms.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Hm...this should be the address for that "request for one-on-one help on the Griffin late night radio show". +However, whose room is this? There's no nameplate on it...
()||:She presses her ear to the door, but she can't hear anything from beyond it.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Ah, who cares? Not me!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:(Knocks) Is anyone there? It's me, the dazzling Gr HK45,  an offline volunteer from Radio Griffin!
()||:The door suddenly flies open. A dark shape lunges out from within and grabs her by the waist.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker><Shake>0</Shake>||<震屏3>:W-whoa! +I know I'm just too charming but please don't attack me out of nowhere! Please let go, or else I'll have to take sterner measures—
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Help...me...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Huh? You're...P38?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Yes, I am! Help me, Gr HK45!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:So this was actually a storage room, no wonder there's no nameplate on the door... Have you been living here recently, P38?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yes, because this place is better for making music... My current dorm is a two-person room, so I might disturb my roomie if I played music there. +Granted, she hasn't been coming back recently, but I still want to leave the place quiet for her.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:That does make sense. Your roommate is lucky to be paired up with someone as thoughtful as you!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Haha... But it doesn't help me with my current problem at all! Please help me, Miss Volunteer!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Waitwaitwait, don't just hug me again! +So tell me, what kind of difficulty are you having, P38?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, I got worked up and... +It's like this.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Okay~ I'm listening.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I used to be a virtual singer, and although I'm currently being employed by Griffin, it's kind of a shame to give up on my old trade... +So whenever I'm free, I put out new songs on web platforms like the old days.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Yup yup, I do a lot of livestreaming myself! +Which platform do you use? What's your name there?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Ah, it's called "Magic Stage", it's been really popular recently...and my username is...+<Size=30>..."Apprentice Witch".</Size>
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Apprentice Witch?!+Are you talking about THE Apprentice Witch who's famous for livestreaming a cappella songs for free but never showing her face? THAT Apprentice Witch?!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yes... Wait a minute, don't tell me you're...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I'm a huge fan of yours!+You have NO idea how amazing your songs are, they're like the morning breeze over a lake on a summer day, or motor oil pooling in the bottom of a repair vat on a moonlit night! Just hearing them puts me at ease! I love you so much!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm deeply honored that you like me! +But, uh, could you please let go of me? I mean, you just said you didn't want me to hug you out of nowhere...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Ahem, pardon me... So, what kind of problem are you facing? No matter what it is, I'll make sure I think of a solution for you!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That's fine. One of my singles made it to the top of Magic Stage's charts a couple of days ago, so an online event organizer invited me to appear on her program as a lead singer...and she promised a hefty payment for it too.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Isn't that a good thing? Let me guess - there was a scheduling clash between your work and the event?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No, not at all. All I've done recently is run logistics, so it's way easier for someone like me to apply for days off than it is for the elites. +As it happens, that event organizer works in Griffin too, so I went to see her yesterday...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>|||<黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN><回忆>:Hello, are you the event organizer, MDR?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:There you are, Apprentice Witch! I've been waiting a long time for you... +...Wait a minute, what are you doing here?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm Apprentice Witch, MDR.+What's with that look on your face?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Uh, how shall I put it... It's like finding out that the salmon you dropped a lot of money on actually came from a little river down the road from your house...something like that.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hey! That's mean!
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Sorry, sorry. I was just too shocked, so... +Who would have thought that the a cappella singer I had my eye on would actually turn out to be the soprano brainlet who's infamous throughout the base?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That's even worse! And besides, I CHOSE to try the high notes. A voice like M950A's would be better at drawing the Commander's attention, right?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:People have things they're suited for, and I don't think your small-time voice is suited for the songs M950A sings. +Ah, forget it, on to business. I think you're just too plain, P38.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Plain...? But music is my forte! I'm only going to be the lead singer, right?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:That's not what I'm talking about, I'm referring to a more fundamental problem. +I'll be organizing a huge event this time round, so whether it's your appearance!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Urgh...
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Or your disposition!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Urk!
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Neither of them meet the requirements for taking center stage!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Sobs piteously)
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<关闭蒙版><黑屏2><BIN>89</BIN>:Well, that certainly was a hurtful thing to say, but it IS true...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:What you're saying is very hurtful too, Gr HK45！
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:(Coughs) Sorry about that...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In any case, please help me out, Gr HK45! I don't want to miss this huge livestream event! Please help me shine brighter!
