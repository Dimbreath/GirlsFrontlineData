P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:(Sobs) How am I going to break the news to them...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, regardless of how you're going to do it, shouldn't you come back first so you can tell us?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Uwah! Gr HK45! And is that Stechkin over there?!
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Hey, I'm here too...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Ah, and Spectre M4... How did you know I was here?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Stechkin told us. She said she saw you just now while she was passing by. +Why didn't you come back to tell us about it?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I...I didn't dare go back to face you... +I mean, I'm supposed to be the star of this plan, but I couldn't even do a simple venue booking...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, that's something the three of us will have to deal with together. +We agreed to shine together on the stage, didn't we, P38?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:If you're facing problems, you ought to speak up right away. That way we can think of a solution together. +Trying to handle things by yourself is only going to slow progress, P38.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yeah... I'm sorry, I just don't handle stress well. +I need to be strong to take center stage!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:That's the spirit! Now you're starting to look more like our lead singer!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Er...pardon me for interrupting, but what are you talking about?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Thanks for your concern. +This is just a small project of ours, and we're still in the beginning stages of putting it into practice.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Don't feel like talking about it? But the truth is, I'm the one who booked the place.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Huh? It's you? Are you going to hold an event?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Well, I was planning to hold an event to thank my friends for their hard work. +Do you see how everyone's tired when they come back and they just can't bring themselves to cheer up? Now, I'm sure you'd agree that everyone would benefit if I could find some way to soothe their bodies and souls and restore them to high spirits. Am I wrong?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Ah, that fits perfectly with our plan, doesn't it?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Oh? You were planning something like that too? +What a coincidence.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Spectre M4! +...Forget it. Yes, that's how it is. Our project has similar goals to yours.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Would you mind going into detail?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑点1>:It's like this...
()||<黑点2>:Several minutes later.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Hm... I see! So you're planning to use this to build your reputation and earn sponsorship money! +I can help with that.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Really?! +But...it's going to cost money, right?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch. +While I can provide a venue for free, you guys will need to have a certain level of competence. +I've seen Gr HK45 perform before, and she makes the grade. +I've never heard Spectre M4 singing backup, though, and as for P38... I heard about what happened at the beach last time. Apparently she didn't sing too well.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I picked a high-pitched and loud song to get everyone's attention back then, but songs like that aren't suited for me. +If you don't mind, I can sing a song for you right now!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:That would take too long...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Or you can take a look at this!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:"Magic Stage"? You seem pretty active here. +Let's see... Wait a minute. You're Apprentice Witch?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yes, that's me! That should prove my skills, right?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:...I think I understand what MDR was talking about when she spoke to me that day.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Eh?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Like a salmon that...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Fine! That's enough, I get it! I'm a disappointment, right?!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Indeed you are. You're just too plain compared to how your voice sounds.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) ...That's what I'm trying to change!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Well, if you want to change yourself, just having a venue won't work... +You need to learn from someone who's more experienced.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I tried asking M950A and her friends, but they're all too busy.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Well, I know someone with even more experience in show biz. She ought to be able to help you out.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Really? That's amazing!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Calm down, I'm not finished yet. +She's a very famous actor, but that also means she charges a lot just for showing up. I can't cover that sum for you, because my money was spent booking the venue.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:She charges an appearance fee?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:What, you don't trust me, Gr HK45? +Your face is saying, "Stechkin looks like she's trying to soak us for all the money she can get".
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I find it very hard to think otherwise.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You wound me, Gr HK45... I really am thinking of the performance. +You can ask MDR; I'm the only and also the most reliable middlewoman in Griffin. When she was out of money some time back, I even helped her secure a loan from Miss Thompson.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:No wonder the two of you know each other.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Relax, I'm telling the truth. +Although her appearance fees are very high, they're most definitely worth paying. +Compared to her, M950A and the others are like a bunch of rank amateurs in terms of performing experience.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Could you be talking about THAT Doll...?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Indeed, the very same.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, if it's her, then it definitely makes a lot of sense... +What should we do, P38? You decide.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I...I've decided! +I'll work hard to earn and borrow money to make up the appearance fee!
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:This isn't a one-Doll show, P38! I'll help you out too!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:You certainly are hot-blooded... Alright, alright, I'll help too.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In that case, do your best, ladies.
