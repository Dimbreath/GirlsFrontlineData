SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:You haven't come back to the dorm for several days, but Miss Kalina said you came back every day. Of COURSE I'd be worried! +And then I heard your voice just now, so I followed it here, but I didn't expect that you'd...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Spectre M4...
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Quit shouting my name! You're terrible! I can't believe you were planning on doing that kind of training by yourself!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but...why did you come looking for me, Spectre M4? +Did I get a new roommate?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:...I've been your roomie all this time! And I've ALWAYS been in the dorm, you just pretended not to see me!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I, I see... I'm sorry, I just never noticed you.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Ah, forget it... In any case, I'd like to take part in this training as well. +I mean, if it works, we'll be able to draw lots of attention, right?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Well, I don't mind, but we haven't come up with a plan for that yet. +Do you have any ideas?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Why are you asking me all of a sudden?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, we need to brainstorm this together.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Alright, then. I DO have an idea, but it doesn't seem too reliable to me... At least, that's how it seems so far. +If we can find some way to make ourselves known and gain some fame, we might be able to get a third party to sponsor us. How about that?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:...
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Don't go all quiet on me! I know it sounds dodgy, but you wanted to brainstorm this, right? +I mean, I just wanted to give you food for thought...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:No, we're just thinking about it.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Yeah. Actually...I think it's a pretty good plan, Spectre M4.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Eh? Ehhhh? Really?!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Yup. Very few artists manage to make their debuts from famous talent shows, so being able to appear in front of a crowd would be very lucky. +Most artists start out with bit parts and slowly work their way up. I think that given our skills, it would be easier to get a sponsor if we could find a platform for ourselves.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:So you're saying we can start thinking about the details now...
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Why don't we book a small stage in the city? That way people will see us when they walk past.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:That doesn't seem too workable. We don't have that much seed capital. +Also, the humans in the city are all very busy, so the a cappella songs which P38 specializes in would have a hard time grabbing their attention.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I bet M950A and the others would be perfect for putting on shows like that... +Ah, that sure did a number on my confidence.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Get a hold of yourself, P38!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:As for M950A...you know, I just had a stroke of inspiration when you mentioned their band. What do you think of the battlefield?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:The battlefield? There's no way we could perform on a solemn place like that, right?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:But that's where we'll meet the most people! Still, you can't sing a cappella there...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Well, it can't be any more ridiculous than trying to sing for peace in the vacuum of space.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I think I get your meaning, Gr HK45. +Although we can't actually sing on the battlefield, we can comfort our friends with our songs as they return from the battlefield!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Hey, you said that, not me.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:That's amazing! It's definitely got potential!
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Hehe... So it's decided, then?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Yup! I don't mind! +In that case, P38 can be the lead singer, and I'll provide backup...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I can dance while singing backup. I'm good at that.
