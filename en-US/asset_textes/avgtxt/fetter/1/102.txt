()||:P38 screams her plea at the top of her voice, as though she's been driven to her wit's end. +It's so loud that it even makes its way out of the half-closed door and echoes down the corridor.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I'm happy to help you, P38! +However, as an idol, all I can do is help you repackage yourself...like say, giving you advice on how to dye your hair or give yourself a makeover, that sort of thing.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That's enough! Please give me a hand!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:No, that won't be enough. +In order to stand on stage, you need more than just a pretty face. You also need the courage to face the tens of thousands of eyes looking up at you from the audience, and the skills to match your fans' love for you. +I don't doubt your abilities, P38...but do you remember what everyone thought of you the last time you went on that beach vacation?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Well yes, it wasn't very good... My delivery and choice of songs were...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:And that is a major problem, Apprentice Witch.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<立绘震动>:Ah!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Once you give MDR your word, singing is no longer a hobby for you, but a job. +And taking on a job means you need to do it to the best of your ability. Therefore, you need to show your audience the best side of yourself.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Yeah... I ought to do that.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I've never seen you do livestreams with your face exposed before, but according to the records from that time at the beach, what you've done is a long way from living up to the task. +You even got nervous in front of your colleagues, and now you're going to do a "Magic Stage" live show...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) I'm going weak at the knees just thinking about it...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I can't help you with those things, Apprentice Witch. That's a test of your experience, and your experience lies in your memories. +Even for me, I've got nothing worth mentioning beyond this face of mine... Granted, I can dance pretty well, but that's about it.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:So you're bothered by things like that too?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:The road to perfection is a long one. +My singing skills are average for an idol. I can't compare to a pro singer. +I've got fans of my own too, so I owe it to them to take responsibility for what I do.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:That's right! I need to work hard for the people who like me! That said, where should I begin?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Let's start by changing your image... Let me look at this shopping site. +What do you think of this outfit?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:I could buy half of it with the money I've saved up.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Half of it? Which half?
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Uh...the half that doesn't have decorations on it.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:A content creator like you would starve to death.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Well, I DO have a job in Griffin...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:In other words, not having enough money to buy clothes is also another challenge for you.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) MDR said the deadline is in two weeks... If I can't make the grade, she'll have to find someone else!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:That's a really tight deadline, but two weeks ought to be enough. +Perhaps we should ask someone to help you train?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Take me with you...
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Training? You mean, training for standing on stage and letting people look at me?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:I want to go with you!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Yup. I can help correct your posture and your styling... And as for money, how about taking out a loan?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Listen to me! I want to go too!
()||:Someone shoves the door open from the outside. Startled, P38 and Gr HK45 stare at the person standing there.
P38(0)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Spectre M4? What are you doing here?
