()||:Half a day later, in front of the storage room.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:"The Star Chamber"... Okay, who put that sign up?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:It was me. This is where our plan begins, so at the very least we need to make it look decent, right? +Plus, calling it the "Tactical Command Room" would clash with the name of the Commander's room.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Even so, calling it The Star Chamber seems a little over the top...+Forget it, how are things on your end?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:They're going great! +I sent a link to an online questionnaire to all the Dolls who weren't on dispatch, and I got about 50 replies.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:50? That's quite a sizable number... +So how was the feedback?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:There were 20 people who said they wanted to listen to our singing after coming back, 13 said they just wanted to rest, nine other said they would be interested in listening, but might have trouble making it on time since they'd go straight to the repair room upon coming back. And eight more said they were okay with anything.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:That sounds pretty promising... +Wait, am I the only one who hasn't made any progress?!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:You tried to approach M950A, right?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Yeah, but Miss Kalina told me that they've been really active on the frontlines recently, and are pretty much unreachable except through the Commander's combat channels...
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Then we won't be able to absorb performance experience from them. +That's a little troublesome... Is P38 back yet?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I didn't see her on my way back. +Has she gone to book a venue? It should be pretty quick.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:Could something have happened to her? Let's go, we've got to find her. +Wait a minute, Spectre M4, not so...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Ow!
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker><Shake>0</Shake>||:Ah!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...We're in the dorm block, you might run into someone. +Are you both okay?
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:I'm fine... She was sent flying, though.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Sent flying?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Ow, that hurts... +Repairs are really expensive, you know. If any of my parts get broken, you're footing the bill.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:Sorry, Stechkin. +Can you stand? Let me help you up...
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:Oh, I'm fine. No harm done, I think. What on earth were you doing, running around in such a hurry?
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:We're looking for P38. She's been out for a while and hasn't come back yet.
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:P38? Last I saw her, she was crying near the training ground.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker><Shake>0</Shake>||:She was crying? What happened?
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:I think it was some kind of venue problem? +The base facilities have been booked solid recently, and Miss Kalina couldn't find another place for her.
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:I see... Thank you, Stechkin - we'll go find her right away!
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||:You girls certainly have a good relationship. +I happen to be free, so let's go check on her together. I'll lead the way.
SpectreM4(0)<Speaker>Spectre M4</Speaker>||:You're a wonderful person! Let's go!
HK45(0)<Speaker>Gr HK45</Speaker>||:...+<color=#A9A9A9>Is Stechkin really THAT kind-hearted?</color>
APS(0)<Speaker>Stechkin</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Haha, it's nothing. Don't mention it.
