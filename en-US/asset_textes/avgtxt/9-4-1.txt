RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Testing, testing... This is RO with a mid-mission report. The operation is proceeding smoothly, I think...+It's just that SOP II's efficiency is still a little low... I suspect her emotions are negatively impacting her reactions.+That's right... She has noticed it herself, but the situation is worse than she thinks...+For the past hour, her responses to my orders have been slower by an average of 1.3 seconds.+Her processing speed is still within an acceptable margin, but she occasionally zones out while resting. It seems that her concentration has waned as well.+I don't know why, but I have a feeling that she is keeping something from me.+The search operation for M16 relies on SOP II's experience, and we only have one last area to search.+However, it's not just SOP II. I probably need some rest as well since we've been working for 20 hours straight. It's been a bit stressful, not because of the mission, but rather it's that...I've been thinking about too many unnecessary things... +How strange, I'm clearly just a T-Doll...+I'll end the report here for now. We're continuing the operation.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>：RO...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：......
RO635(4);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：RO...?+RO...!?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：Whuh...?+What is it?
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I've finished searching this side. The Commander's echelons still need some time. Shouldn't we have someone guarding our position?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：Ah...right...I'll go...
RO635(0);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：You're the leader, so the load on your neural cloud must be much higher than mine. You're already struggling to keep your eyes open, aren't you?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：......+(Bitter smile) Indeed, whether it be recharging or clearing my cache...+Are you sure you're fine by yourself?
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：The nearby Sangvis troops have all been eliminated, and just standing around won't really drain my energy.+You helped me fall asleep before, so now it's my turn to help you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Uhm...can you forget about that? It was kind of embarrassing.
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Heheh, that's right, only you would do something like that, RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Is that...a compliment?
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Of course...+I'm thankful you're here, RO.+Sorry for giving you so much trouble...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：You don't need to apologize all the time. It's fine as long as you're happy. Besides, you've been treating me very nicely as well.
RO635(0);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：That's because you treat me well, so I'm just returning the favor.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Haha... If only everyone in the world is just like you, then things would be much simpler...+I'll leave it to you, then. I'll try to recover as soon as possible, then you can rest.+Also, report to me if there's any change in the situation.
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：You're really like M4 right now.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Do you like me this way?
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：At least this time, I do.
()||<BIN>9</BIN>：......+...One hour later.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：......+...It's been an hour on the timer. It went by pretty quickly this time...+SOP II...it's your turn to rest.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：...!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：SOP II?!+Are you there, SOP II?
()||：......+...RO carefully opens the door of the safe house, but there aren't any Griffin signals nearby.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Damn it...+Not again...+Not like this...!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：SOP II's signal should still be trackable... I need to find her.
