NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:I'll now assign you an important mission. I hope you're ready, Commander.+Our frontlines have retrieved several injured T-Dolls that are in urgent need of repair once they're transported back to base.+But intel shows that a Sangvis outpost is still operating autonomously under minimal command along our transport route.+They don't actually pose much threat to us, but these injured T-Dolls are very important to us, and there must be no room for mistakes.+So if you'd please dispose of that outpost quickly to ensure our T-Dolls' safe return.
