M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Everyone at Griffin! +This is our last stand. +Thanks to 416, we all made our way safely back here. +Our defense line remains strong and robust; we're sufficiently armed; we all have the courage to fight for our survival. +The enemy units are immensely powerful - more powerful than the usual PMC. +They attack us relentlessly, fearlessly. +But we have the Commander, flexible tactics, and a wealth of experience. We also have each other, but most importantly, we know why we're here. +True, they don't fear death, but only we know what it truly means to live. +Say something, too, 416.

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<白屏1>0,5</白屏1>:...We made it. +But it wasn't thanks to me, I didn't think I could save you all. +It was the Commander who believed in you. The Commander said we must save all our T-Dolls, and so I did. +I don't have the right to stand amongst you, but if it's an order, I'll carry it out. +Because only the Commander can lead us to victory, and only in victory do I see the future...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I will get what I want my own way. +It may not be a simple question of "should I stay or should I go".
