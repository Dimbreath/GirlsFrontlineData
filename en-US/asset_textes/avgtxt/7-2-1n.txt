AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker><通讯框>||:Galil hailing Negev. Do you copy?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Get on with it.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Target location is confirmed. It's inside that abandoned car factory, just as our intel says.
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Humph. Of course. It's my intel.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Fine, fine. Everything is yours. We're all yours. +But you know how to read a map, right? You see how far we are from the car factory?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Is it that far? It's only a three-hour walk, right?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:We could get there in three hours IF this was a smooth marathon route with no enemies or obstacles. +Guess where we are, my lady?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||<震屏>:We're in bloody Sangvis territory!
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:That's why I sent you to scout ahead.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Ha, ha, ha. How "cautious" of you. +Now what? I did my job. What about you?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:You stay here and keep gathering intel. The Commander is about to lead our echelons forward. +I'll get in touch with Tavor and find out her infiltration progress.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Hmm, Negev?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:What?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Be careful.
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:It's just a night op. Nothing I can't handle.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||<黑屏1>:I keep saying... +Whatever. Do your best. Keep everyone safe.

<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||<黑屏2>:Negev.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Hmm?
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:You're too reckless.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I know.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:You didn't learn anything I taught you.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I wouldn't call that teaching, Jericho. You sent me to die. +Even if I had learned anything, I forgot all about it after dying.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I told you I'll help you remember.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:But then...we'll forget about you.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I don't care. We are soldiers.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Humans don't leave their own safety in the hands of cold, rigid robots. That's why they chose us. +My neural cloud tells me that I don't want to forget you. If I can have my way, no one will ever forget you.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Who taught you...to have such..."thoughts"?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:... +What on earth are you afraid of, Jericho?
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:... +You really have grown a little when I wasn't looking... At least in terms of rhetoric. +But what exactly was your target of retrieval in your operation?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Well...wait for it... +Let me organize my thoughts. I'll reveal it in good time.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I was right. When you retire, you'll make a great talk show host.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:Anyway, so I directed the Commander to advance towards the car factory. +After a skirmish, we took the outpost and got in touch with Tavor...
