AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I never thought it'd be so hard to operate without being able to shoot...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:We're lucky the enemies' sensors aren't particularly good... They don't seem to be able to scan us. +An entire convoy will be passing by 15 meters away in ten seconds.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Got it... I see them.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Steady... Steady... Alright, they have their backs to us! Cross the road now!
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We did it... That was really close. Can you make out the locations of the other enemies?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I can only hack units that are close by... I don't want to be too conspicuous. We're dead if they notice our presence.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I've picked up some weapons and ammo, but they don't match our Imprints so don't expect anything amazing.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:All the more reason we have to be extra careful. Slipping away right under the enemies' nose without making a single peep is our only chance.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But even if we aren't discovered, time is still a problem if we just keep crawling our way through this rubble bit by bit. +If Ange and the others manage to get out, they'll leave this area as fast as they can. +Once they go beyond our signal range...then we...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Tsk... I see your point... But we don't really have any other choice, unless...
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Unless you can move in a way that's completely invisible to your enemies – like ghosts.</color>

()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Surprised?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>But weren't you...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Left behind in the white units' system?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you hadn't attempted to hack them, I probably couldn't have found you. Sadly, you don't really have a choice.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So we meet again. It must be fate.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Tsk...</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I was working so hard trying to help you, yet you gave me the slip just like that. Don't you feel the slightest bit guilty?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You're only helping me to achieve your own goal. When it comes to you, there's nothing to feel guilty about.</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Really? Really now...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Really. I'm my real self only when you aren't meddling.</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmm... I was going to come back and help you get out of here.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But I've changed my mind.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>What...are you trying to do?</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>All this time, I've been helping you for your sake, but you let me down again and again.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I don't need your help, and I certainly don't need you!</color>
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's time I make your realize just how weak you actually are.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>If you think you can get out of this on your own, then prove it.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>However, no one will be there to pick up the slack for you this time. You must taste the consequences of your failure for yourself.</color>

M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:M4, what's wrong? +Spacing out again?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I was just searching for the best route to take. We...we have to run! Now!
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But aren't we supposed to keep out of sight...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||<黑屏1>:We don't have time for that! +Hurry! Follow me!
