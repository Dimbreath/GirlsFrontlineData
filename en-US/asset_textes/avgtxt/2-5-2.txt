NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? Well... Could you play it, Commander?

M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:I do not know how much longer I can keep this up. I have to get in touch with someone from Griffin as soon as possible.

NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:In any case, thank you, Commander.+As expected of the ace that Helian thinks highly of. Hats off to you.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter how highly I think of the commander. It's up to Kryuger to decide who to focus on training.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah! True, the boss has the final say in everything. By the way...

NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Uh... Don't worry.+I've got the data. The results will be out in a mo.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(1)||:Then please make haste. We're running out of time, as you well know.+Besides, we're not training the commander to help you find your beakers.
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Hmm... Commander... Thanks for this time...
NPC-Helian(0);NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Next time I'll treat you to coffee...in my lab...

NPC-Helian(1)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Unless you fancy drinking dirty water used for doing the dishes while sitting in a freezer, I'd suggest you forget it.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's get back on track, Commander.+Griffin is now assigning an important mission to you. I'll give you a detailed explanation...
