()||:【Haven't you just been hanging around in the air and watching us work ourselves to death?!】
()||:【Nonsense. I've been carefully carrying Agent's order and watching over our Lady Elisa, you know.】

()||:【Argh...this is so BORING... What even is the point of our existence...?】
()||:【Perhaps you'd be happier fighting Griffin as a mechanical dog?】
