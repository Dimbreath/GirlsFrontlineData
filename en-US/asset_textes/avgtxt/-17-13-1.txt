HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Haven't our reinforcements arrived yet? +If we keep falling back, we'll have to use the Sangvis database as cover.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;HK416(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:That might actually be a good idea. +I mean, they wouldn't really attack their own main server, right?
UMP9(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Hey, are you serious? +Just being surrounded by them means it's only a matter of time before we're finished off!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||<黑点1><BIN>34</BIN>:Gager is already chasing the fake signal M4 and I created. +Just hold on for a while longer...we'll be able to begin our counterattack soon.
()||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点2>:...Several minutes later.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:45, their attack is weakening. +Eh? They've stopped?!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Looks like the plan worked. +Gager ought to be focused on dealing with M4 now.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Ughh...does that mean I can take a nap? +We've been fighting for 7 to 8 hours straight... I'm so tired...
()||<BIN>34</BIN>:...Two minutes later.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Some of the Sangvis units surrounding us have withdrawn.  +Though a few of them have stayed behind... It looks like they're going to continue fighting.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:So they're not going to let us off so easily... +Gager...you're pretty cautious.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:What should we do now?
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Wipe out the enemies surrounding us. +After that, cut off Gager's escape route.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Whaaaat... We're still going?
G11(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点1>:Just give your best one more time, Gr G11. +If it works, you'll be able to have a good rest soon.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点2>:We've taken care of all the enemies in this area!
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Good, now let's hurry and catch up with Gager.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Why do we still have to move...? +Didn't you say I only had to work hard one more time?
G11(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:What comes next counts under "one more time".
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Ah...you're so sly, 45...
G11(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I told you, you can't believe a word she says.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Eh...but... +416...I can't run anymore...
G11(3);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Don't look at me, I'm not going to carry you and run. +There are military units all around. Who knows when they'll wake up again. +If you don't want to be left in a pile of monsters, then you'd better do your best.

BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:Checkmate. +In truth, I did not expect you to pick this corner as the place where you would meet your tragic, pitiful end. +M4A1, I am very glad that we will no longer need to keep harassing each other.
BOSS-7(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...Oh yes. +There's no need for that anymore. +I'm glad you were willing to accompany me all the way to the end of the line, Gager.

BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:404?! +You're still alive?
BOSS-7(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Oh, don't look so surprised. +That's right, to celebrate our reunion, we've prepared some presents for you. +Please, don't be shy and accept them.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...What?! +The signals of the units behind me have vanished... but how?!
