One of them closes the half-opened driver-side door, and her form is reflected in the window's glass.

RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Well, it'll be the same no matter where we go. After all, the opposition are a bunch of pretty tough customers.+Let me think... Got it, we'll look for an opportunity to flank them. That way we'll win for sure!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_Landmine_Movement</SE1>:A torrent of enemy fire rains down on the cop car which they're using as cover and throws up a shower of sparks. MDR reflexively throws out a seeker mine, which activates and swiftly rolls out from under the vehicle.
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Nicely done, MDR!
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I mean, I'm the one suffering here. Seriously, that was my last one!

RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Wait, MDR, don't run around!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:However, the burning MDR completely ignores Am RFB's words. The moment she leaps out from behind cover, all the firepower pouring down on the cop car focuses on her.

RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Who would have thought The Division would be so hard.
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Well, it's only natural for games to be a bit challenging. Otherwise, what would be the fun in playing them?
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Fun?+In the first place, it was a very old game circulating on Grifchan. I decided to go play it to unlock all the achievements because it seemed interesting, but instead we've been dying right before the mission finished, over and over again, from 9:30 PM to 4:30 AM.+I don't know if this is fun or not, but the lifespan of my parts is quickly running out!
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Well, it's not like we've been on missions recently anyway, so what's wrong with killing some time?
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Have you heard that urban legend recently about a civilian Doll who had mobility issues because her parts got old and she ended up slipping and falling into a furnace ...

RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Play on Normal? What does that mean?
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Well, if it's difficult to play with just two people...+Then wouldn't it be easier if you had more people helping you?
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Can we really get that many people to help?
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Of course we can! This game supports up to 24 players at once!
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:... +So you're saying you were just making the game harder on purpose?!
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Ah, well, you can't really say that!+We were just starting out, so I wanted to test the waters...
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:(Sighs) So, how are you going to get another 22 players to join us?+I mean, we gamers aren't exactly numerous to begin with, and this is a pretty old game too. Even if we went and asked people, they might not be interested, you know?
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Oh, that's simple. We'll just have to offer them an incentive!
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What incentive?
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Didn't you say something about them browsing Grifchan regularly? If you use "that", they'll be jumping at the chance to take part.
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What is "that", anyway?
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>;MDR(0)||:Well, to be precise, come a bit closer...+(Whisper whisper whisper)
RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Hm...+Mhm...+Ohhhh! +That...that sounds really fun!

RFB(0);MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Plus, we'll get to show off our skills to those noobs. I'm kind of looking forward to it now, hahaha!
RFB(0)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Well, it's only to be expected since we're pros, hahahaha!

()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Late at night, a post shows up on Grifchan...
()||<黑屏1>:
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>97</BIN>:—Griffin HQ.+It's morning, and the warm sunlight shines in through the skylight.+The corridors are still quiet. Groups of two or three people walk by every now and then, but when they pass by the Data Room, something seems to catch their attention. After stopping and watching for a while, they enter.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Inside the Data Room, a large group of Dolls have congregated outside the door of the innermost room.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's so interesting?
路过的人形()<Speaker>Doll Passerby</Speaker>||:Ah, good morning, Commander...+It's Miss Kalina, something seems to be wrong with her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Doll points inside the room, where Kalina is sprawled motionless on her desk.+The Dolls don't think she's ill, probably because she's radiating an aura of unapproachability.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Ah... Good morning, Commander...
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ugh, you look terrible...+Are you alright?
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Uh... Yeah...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina forcefully slaps her cheeks, and after recovering her spirits, she seems a little better.+...Probably.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sorry, I had a really long session of Radio Kalina last night...+And I haven't been able to sleep because something's been bothering me lately...
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you pulled an all-nighter?+This isn't a good habit, but if that's the reason, then you'd better go catch up on your sleep.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But-but how could I do that?
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's better than you wearing yourself out. Relax, the only thing that needs doing today is the accounting, and you can do that tomorrow.+Leave whatever's been bothering you till tomorrow as well.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:...Ugh, the accounts ARE what's bothering me!
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...What's wrong with the accounts?
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Here's the thing... I was checking our income and expenditure for the previous quarter and I found that even after factoring in the funds we've been allocated and adding in all the commissions for all our future assignments, we won't be able to break even.+And the worst part is that the discrepancy is only going to grow as time goes on!
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Wait a minute. So you're saying...
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Yes, we're out of money.+We're not penniless yet, but it's only a matter of time before we get there.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We haven't been able to accept commissions and fulfill contracts for various reasons recently, but that alone shouldn't be enough to put us into such a state.
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No, it's a stain on my professional career for allowing our finances to dip into the red!
NPC-Kalin(12)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, you don't need to be so hard on yourself. I'll talk to Miss Helian about this. Before that, you should go get some rest.+You girls, take care of Kalina. I'm heading to my office for a bit.
()<Speaker>Surrounding Dolls</Speaker>||:Sure thing!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After sorting out everything, the Commander turns around and is about to leave the office before coming face to face with a couple of Dolls.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Huh, the Commander's here!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Good morning~
K5(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Let me guess, looking for me?
K5(0);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well...we were mainly looking for Miss Kalina. It seemed like her sort of thing.
K5(0);R93(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Kalina burned the midnight oil and she's resting now. I'd advise you not to disturb her for the time being.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:I see. Well, that's a shame.
K5(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:What exactly happened? Can you tell me about it?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Well, a friend just saw this on Grifchan.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:R93 seems ready to demonstrate and gestures for me to check my personal data terminal. It shows a connection request coming from R93 herself.+After clicking "accept", a message expands to fill the tablet's screen. There is a spiral-shaped logo on it.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:..."New major event — 'The Division' Survival Tournament"?+What's this, were you going to invite Kalina to play?
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Not really. The important part is the reward — the winner gets a prize of 10 million dollars! 10 million!
R93(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Offering that kind of money is typically the lead-in to a scam of some sort. Sounds very sketchy to me.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:You sound pretty familiar with this sort of thing?
K5(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Things like this were common enough back in the peaceful days. And when you consider the state of the world now...+You get my drift.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:But I did a quick reading just now and my financial luck is going to be great today. No matter how you look at it, it all seems related to this game tournament.+Are you really not going to consider it?!
K5(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, you say that, but I'm sure nobody would be interested in a dubious message like...
()<Speaker>Kalina's Voice</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Did somebody say 10 million bucks?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...+...Perhaps I spoke too soon, because someone actually IS interested in it.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:Ah, Miss Kalina!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:How come you're suddenly so full of energy? Are you alright?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm perfectly fine!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You look much better now, but you didn't sleep at all last night, so maybe you shouldn't take this kind of suspicious news so seriously.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Wait a minute, Commander. Whether it's real or not, it's still 10 million dollars!+If we can get our hands on that prize money, all our financial woes will be solved!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh, maybe you should calm down a little.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:How can I stay calm after hearing that? This is my ticket to not being known as "the financial black hole" among the adjutant circle!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Do base adjutants actually have their own social scene?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:R93, this message was posted on Grifchan, right?
NPC-Kalin(8);R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position>||:Huh? Y-yeah, but why?
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Very good, then our mission for today will be to take part in this event and win 10 million dollars!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;R93(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||:Wait a minute, we're not on vacation today...
NPC-Kalin(8);K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker>||:But we haven't been deployed on any missions recently!
NPC-Kalin(8);K5(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Right, I forgot about that part.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;K5(0)||:Therefore, I'm sure you understand just how important this is. Without that 10 million, we'll have nothing to do BUT go on vacation.+So please, just for today, help me solve our financial problems!
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You're seriously going to solve our financial crisis by playing games?+...Oh well. But only for today.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:You're the best!
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm only doing this because I don't want you to be so frustrated, but you should know that this isn't the right way to solve your financial woes.+And if we don't get that 10 million, I'll still have to consult Miss Helian about the matter.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:No problem! I'll go arrange things right away!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina's previous fatigue is swept away, and she rushes out of the room, brimming with energy.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...+This is a little worrying, but it's good that she's all cheered up now.

NPC-Kalin(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Leaving that aside for now, why are we the only two playing the game?
NPC-Kalin(13)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Aw, playing games is easy! Just shoot the enemy until they die and you win!

NPC-Kalin(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Contamination... Sounds like there's ELID infection in the area.

NPC-Kalin(11)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Is the game THAT realistic?!
NPC-Kalin(11)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I mean, it's snowing really heavily... Though I have to say, the conditions this game is simulating are pretty harsh. Seems worse than the Green Zones.

指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well, our objective is just recovering medicine, but we'll probably run into a lot of trouble on the way, so we'd best be careful.
NPC-Kalin(13)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I don't get a chance to do this very often, but now that I'm in the game, I ought to show my stuff!
