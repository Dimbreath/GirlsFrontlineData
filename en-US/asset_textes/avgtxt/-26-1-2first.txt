()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>157</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Task Force DEFY charge ahead blindly until they come across a communications outpost.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:There it is! Cough...get in!
NPC-AngeDamage(3);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Nyet, this place isn't clean at all. We can't stop here!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Obey my orders! Hurry...cough!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2>:...Task Force DEFY enters the outpost.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:The radiation level is too high here. New ELIDs will emerge anytime. We can't stay here for long.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:Cough...do as I say... +Now, turn on the comms system...and scan for signals!
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:On it. The instrument isn't too badly damaged. Attempting to reactivate it... +This equipment is left behind by the military. I've bypassed the firewall. 94, you can now try to access their network and collect some data.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:Understood. Scanning... +Bad news. I have hacked into the system and reassembled information regarding the topography. Units bearing military signals are already on the move in this area. +Judging by their speed and formation, they do not seem to be ELIDs. +I would assume that they are reorganizing their remaining troops. In the worst-case scenario, they have already discovered us.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:Then let's pray they haven't, or we're dead...cough... +Quick, still remember the Griffin Commander's comms frequency...? Try to get in touch.
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Are you sure? Gathering information in a data blackout is one thing, sending a transmission from a military outpost is another matter. There's no way we can hide our tracks - they're gonna surround this place and blast us to bits.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(2)||:This is our only chance if we want to walk out of this building alive... +We've come this far, we have no other choice but to raise the stakes. Establish a connection immediately. If we're fast enough, we might be able to leave before the military reacts!
NPC-AngeDamage(0);AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Got it. Establishing a communications channel. Ready in thirty seconds.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:While this battered communicator still has some battery left... Persica. Persica, do you copy?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There's a bit of static, but I can hear you. How are you doing, Ange?</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:My satellite communicator is almost out of juice. Let's keep it short. +DEFY found me. I'm relatively safe for now. We're using a military outpost to establish comms. Whether the Griffin Commander gets it is up to chance.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:We're transmitting. Pick up...please pick up...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...Nothing but static.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:【Static】......+......
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:So Griffin has left already... +This...is how it ends...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange...</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Haha... Can't be helped. I didn't expect it to end like this...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Wait! There's a reply!
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What?! Who is it on the other end?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's the commander! Commander, can you hear me? It's Persica!</color>
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...<c><color=#00CCFF>Miss Persica! Are you okay?</color> <c><color=#00CCFF>I think I heard a familiar voice?</color> <c><color=#00CCFF>Persica...who's that again?</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:<color=#00CCFF>That's Angelia...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Uh...I think you know who she is. I'll let her do the talking.</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:<color=#00CCFF>Humph. Don't worry about me, worry about yourselves.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ange is here. There's a favor she needs to ask.</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:<color=#00CCFF>Forgotten all about your technical supervisor already? You're getting a pay cut.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Enough jokes. Ange needs to talk to you.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hello, Commander. This isn't the first time we talked, but it's the first time I'm introducing myself. +"Angelia". Of course, it's just my codename, but I quite like the name, so feel free to call me that. +I'm an agent from the Bureau of State Security. We've worked together numerous times in the past. I'm sure you have a lot of questions, but you must understand that we're on the same side.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2>:<color=#00CCFF>I can vouch for her. I've known her for years. She's a nice person, but she does have a bad temper.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||:Whatever, Persica... Our channel won't hold for long, so please listen to me. +I understand you've suffered heavy casualties, so Persica is going to provide you with Heavy Ordnance Corps to aid you in battle. +Send the coordinates to Persica where you need help. She'll find a way to deliver them there. Persica, how's Havier's withdrawal plan coming along?
NPC-AngeDamage(0);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Havier has already provided me with the extraction point, but said it'll still take a while for the transports to get clearance into the area.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I've sent you the coordinates, Commander. Guard the extraction point with your life. I hope you'll last till the tranports get there.
AK12(3)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:Ange, we've been discovered. A transmission is forcing its way through.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ange... 【static】I know it's you... I will make you pay for what you've done【static】!</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Cut him off. I've got no time to chat with him.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Okay.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Yegor's transmission is cut off.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:As you can see, Commander, the situation isn't looking good. We should all prepare for the worst.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, we've given you everything we can. I hope we'll all come out of this alive...so please find a way to help Ange...</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Commander, you can't save everyone on the battlefield... Ensure Griffin's safety first. Only consider our rescue if it's at all possible. +I'll send all the information I have to you. AK-12, set up the data transfer.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:On it.
NPC-AngeDamage(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:If I can't make it, please take care of Task Force DEFY, find the AR Team, and stop the enemies who want to destroy our future.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange, the military units we detected are closing in.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Tsk...he really hates us to the bone. Commander, we'll wait till dawn. No matter what you choose to do, no one will blame you. Good luck.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Data transfer in progress. We can move in 60 seconds.
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Persica...I'd better go. If I come back alive, I think I'm gonna get a cat.
NPC-AngeDamage(2);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Can I come over and pat it?</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;NPC-Persica(3)||:As long as you pay for the cat food...
NPC-AngeDamage(2);NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I will, so you better make sure you come back alive.</color>
NPC-AngeDamage(2)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I really can't say for sure this time...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Transfer complete. We can go.
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:This means we will not be able to contact anybody from now on. We can only feel our way around the dark on our own or wait for Griffin's signal.
NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I know... Let's go. We must hold out till the commander comes to our rescue.
