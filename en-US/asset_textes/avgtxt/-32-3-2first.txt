()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_va_those_who_dwell_in_shadows</BGM>:...The battle ends.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<震屏>:...Bang! +...Stella leads the Parapluie-controlled Dolls and kicks open the door to the Prime Minister's office.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:WA2000, keep an eye on the outside.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Stella stalks up and pulls Dorothy out from where she's hiding under the desk.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>||:Uwaaaahhhh—!
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:So you were hiding here after all, little Dorothy. +Were you planning to die surrounded by all these mementos of your vanity?
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Uuuu... I surrender, I surrender! +You you you, what do you want? Money? A *Kira* Miki handshake voucher?
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I do want a *Kira* Miki handshake voucher, but I can buy one with money.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Then...maybe I could try fixing your cat ears?
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker><Shake>||:These aren't cat ears! +Dammit, I can't believe we actually elected a Prime Minister who doesn't even know what Cat Boomers are! Do you even care about anything?!
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:I...I care about what you're going to do to me now...
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I would very much like to slowly dismantle you and livestream it on Youturbo, but that won't get me the answers I want. +Tell me about the Earth Computer or Alma! Give me an answer to one of them at the very least!
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:You won't find out what you want even if you take apart my brain, because I really don't know where they are!
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Is that so? That's fine too. I expected this.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Stella dumps Dorothy on the ground, and Dorothy pulls herself into a sitting position.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then I'll take you apart piece by piece and we'll see if that "Anna" can bear to not tell me.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:...+Why... +Why do you know that name?
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I looked into many things while I was gone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Dorothy falls silent for a moment, and then she takes a deep breath.
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||<BGM>m_va_reminiscence</BGM>:Stella, I really should have finished you off when I learned what you were investigating that day.
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:You couldn't have, Dorothy, because you're not a bad person. +I know that "Anna" exists. I also know that she's your big sister. You're not loyal to the Earth Computer, or Griffin City, but to her.
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Well done. So what can you do about it?
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:There's no doubt that she was the one who hid the Earth Computer! +I need to find her as soon as possible to recover the Earth Computer and put it back in its original place to prevent Griffin City from being destroyed by the sand rains!
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:And so you came looking for me? Stella, you don't understand my sister at all, do you? +She doesn't care about me, so taking me hostage is pointless. +Even if you ripped my tongue out and made sushi out of it before dunking it into wasabi, she would keep that same stiff smile on her face. You wouldn't even be able to get a dimple out of her.
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I've seen your personal ID. She raised you by hand.
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:She raised me by hand to be what she needed - a tool.
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Yes, that's right! And everything you've done so far is about as useful as a bottle opener on a beverage can. +Pointlessly pushing the sand into the ocean and having everyone in Griffin City make merry every night. All we're actually doing with our lives is just waiting to die!
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||<震屏>:That's because there IS nothing else we can do but wait to die! +Stella, my big sister is the most dangerous and the most mysterious person in the world... +There's no way you can find her, and even if you do find her, nobody knows how to deal with her!
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Don't tell me even you don't know her true identity?
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:I don't know. I don't even know what she is. A human? A Doll? +Every time she appears, it's like a ghost in my mind, and then she vanishes mysteriously without a trace. I've even suspected that she was just a bug in my neural cloud, but I could never locate it no matter how hard I've tried.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:All I know is that she's eagerly awaiting the end of the world... There is nothing I could to do stop her...
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:All I could do...is to let everyone die without regrets...before the apocalypse arrives...
Dorothy(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;Stella(2)||:...Dorothy's words trail off into sobs.
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Nobody can wait contentedly for the end to come, unless they've already struggled with all their might.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:I don't understand you, Stella. The concept of "death" lacks substance to us Lilims... +My fear of death was programmed into me, but what really terrifies me is losing Griffin City and my friends.
Dorothy(2);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I won't just sit back and wait for the end, Dorothy. +"Strive endlessly on the road to victory" — I would like for my life to end while living that way. +So, are you willing to help me? I know you want to make a choice. There's still time for you.
Dorothy(2)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:...+While I don't think it's too likely that you'll win, I think I can understand your point of view... +Perhaps I should really give it some thought— +...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Dorothy freezes.
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:(Bitter smile) But it looks like it's too late...
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Dorothy...?
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:...She's coming.
Dorothy(4);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:What?
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:No...I can feel it... +My body...it's not responding to me... +How is she doing this!? She's never controlled my body like this before!
Dorothy(3);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:What's with you, Dorothy!?
Dorothy(3)<Speaker>Dorothy</Speaker>;Stella(2)||<黑屏1>:I'm sorry, Stella...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +...+ ...A burst of white noise erupts from inside Dorothy's body.
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:...Dorothy?
多萝西？() <Speaker>Dorothy?</Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_synthestitch</BGM>:Who am I? +Am I really alive?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...A creepy laughter then erupts from the white noise.
多萝西？() <Speaker>Dorothy?</Speaker>||:I am very special to all of you. +I am your everything. +...It is time to become one.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...The white noise inside Dorothy's body begins to grow in intensity. +...Suddenly, everything returns to silence. +...
Dorothy(0) <Speaker>Dorothy?</Speaker>||<BGM>m_va_those_who_dwell_in_shadows</BGM><BIN>8</BIN><睁眼>:Greetings... +Good evening, Miss Stella Hoshii. +I am "Anna".
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:And a good Southern Hemisphere to you too, Anna. We meet at last. +Did you take over your sister's body?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Of course. Why else would I have taken in and raised a Lilim? +Although, rather than Lilims, I prefer to tease my own kind.
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Your kind?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:I am a human like you, darling.
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I've never seen a human who could possess a DFC-72.
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Stella, there are many ways in which life can exist. +Mine is a more... elevated form, much like a "god".
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:...How old are you?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Mentally speaking, I'd be a high schooler in the blush of youth? +Oh, don't make that face, Stella. There are far too many things in this world that you don't know.
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I just want to know why you willingly showed up.
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:That's because there's no need for me to hide myself anymore. +In this moment, all the fragments I need are at hand. +And now, there's only one last step remaining, a little "experiment" if you will...
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:What are you going to do, Anna? +Why did you hide the Earth Computer?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:Oh? +Are you so sure that it was me?
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:If not, then who? Who else could have done something like that?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:You got one thing right, at least. I do want to find the Earth Computer to destroy the world. +But the current plan is taking too long. Definitely not my style. +However, I feel that I've already been very generous. I've given my poor little sister a chance to deceive everyone, and I've allowed you to accept your fate without a struggle. +You, yes, you were the one who shattered Becky's little dream.
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:Becky? Who's Becky? +Alright, listen up, I simply don't want to sit back and await my fate!
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:If I were you, I would do the same thing, but unfortunately, I am not, so I won't. +Do you understand what I mean? All this...is no longer important.
Dorothy(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Stella(2)||:...Snap! +...Anna snaps her fingers.
Dorothy(0);Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:What...did you do?
Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>;Stella(2)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Something I couldn't do before... +...Add a bit of chaos to the world.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>;Stella(2)||<BGM>m_va_march_of_the_white_knights</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Stella! A whole bunch of White Knight mechanized units suddenly touched down from the sky!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>There's too many of them, and they...they...</color>
WA2000(0);Dorothy(0)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:I've always wanted to see how the White Knights would fare against Griffin. +These big white bruisers are a lot more useful that those little black S.F. Dinergates.
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Dorothy(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>The White Knight mechs have gone berserk! They're attacking the Dolls here!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The White Knight Dolls and humans are trying to organize a resistance, but there are too many berserk mechs!</color>

WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>;Stella(2)||:<color=#00CCFF>What will you do? Are you going to carry on with your plan?</color>
Stella(2)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||:I don't know if I'll be successful... +But I have to say this development...is a little beyond what I expected. +Anna's true nature might be something more terrifying than I imagined.
Dorothy(4)<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||:Are you afraid, Stella? Do you regret lifting the veil?
Stella(3)<Speaker>Stella</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm excited, Anna. +I originally only wanted to find proof of your existence, but now I'm directly looking at you. +The results of my three years of investigation are more accurate than I predicted.
安娜()<Speaker>Anna</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Accurate? ...You don't get to be the judge of that. +Now then, as the ruler of Griffin City... +...I shall pass verdict on the validity of your findings.
