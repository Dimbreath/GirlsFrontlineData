PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:Outpost secured. Flawlessly done, Commander.+I shall start decoding the data. Get me a chair, SKS.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Ha, and where do you suggest I get a chair? We couldn't even find the door knob when we came in.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:Hmm... How can Sangvis units bear rotting in this dumpster?
AK47(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:This place is only for those in the lower ranks. You should be glad there's a charging port.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:Ha, I pity those pugs and angelfish.
AK47(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:You aren't a fish. How do you even know they're pitiful?
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:Just look at this place. Not a single drop of vodka. I can't stand being in here for even half an hour.
AK47(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:See, AK47, that's your problem. You mustn't indulge in such worldly material gratification.+You should always be contemplating the purpose of our existence as T-Dolls.
AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:Tch. So you're saying, those Sangvis trash have a higher form of existence than me?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:What kind of nonsense are you two prattling about?
PM(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Aren't you the least bit intrigued, Makarov? About the origin and objective of Sangvis T-Dolls?
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>;SKS(0)||:They are enemies who threaten Griffin's interests. We just have to destroy them.
PM(0);SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Humph. Surely you know quite a lot, Makarov, since you're such good buddies with OTs-14.
PM(0);AK47(0)<Speaker>AK-47</Speaker>||:That's right. C'mon, give us some insider story!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...+There, target location acquired. Break time's over.
SKS(0)<Speaker>SKS</Speaker>||:Hey! You know something, don't you?! You must know quite a lot, Makarov!
PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||:...What difference does knowing make?+AK47, SKS, no matter what we know, our order as T-Dolls will never change.+Destroying Sangvis Ferri is all we have to do. So let's continue our mission.
