()||<黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN>:On the outskirts of Tallinn, on the roof of an abandoned building.
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:45, they're on the move.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, it's about time. They've been twiddling their thumbs outside the city for too long.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Shouldn't we catch up with them right away?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There's no need for that. The mission we were given was "provide electronic support for Griffin", not charge into battle.+Besides...
()||:UMP45 looks back at the members of Squad 404.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_stage1</BGM>:How do your brand-new bodies feel? I hope you've all gotten used to them.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><Shake>||:It feels pretty good, but I'd prefer a cool arm like yours, 45!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Sure. If that's what you want, then I'll rip one of your arms off right now and give you mine.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(5)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ahaha, that's a little...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(5)||:Now, if you said you wanted an arm that could do a rocket punch, I could consider that.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:To tell you the truth, I don't feel any different from before I was upgraded.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:That just proves your neural cloud is so old that it can't keep up with the new models. Go get it formatted and put a new one in.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If my neural cloud is old, then yours is only fit for being put into a microwave.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:That sounds nice, I'd like to try a new body myself... +If you could add a pair of noise-canceling headphones, a massage belt and a heated vest, I'd be able to sleep... I mean fight better.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||:I'm sorry, but Squad 404 doesn't have enough money left in the budget to spare for a lazybones who always slacks off and who is eminently disposable.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:No way... I follow you on every job, don't I? At least give me credit for all the suffering I've gone through!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Sleeping during missions is a form of AWOL, you know? After deducting double wages for it, things aren't quite as simple as that. ♪ +Who knows, you might end up owing us money instead~
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Oh, I like that. That's 9 for you. +While that evil idea was yours, I'll be claiming it as mine from now on.
UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Happy to help, 45~
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:Are the two of you actual devils...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...So we're paid on an hourly rate when we're on missions? Then could I get my overtime wages in one lump sum?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Right, enough chatter. +Dier soaked us for a ton this time round, not just for your modifications, but also the bill for my maintenance last time. +To be frank, the pay for this job is really stingy. It wouldn't be enough to pay for your upgrades even if we got the full amount.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But you still took the job on anyway. Is it because you don't want to owe the Commander a favor? Or do you have some kind of personal aim?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Humph. Griffin's goals and my goals coincide. With that and the fact that they're willing to pay, it makes them the ideal clients. +In any case, we've lost contact with Ange, and Persica got in touch with us in person, so something isn't quite right here.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:If this job was really as simple as just protecting the AR Team as Persica had said, then you wouldn't have needed to spend so much money to upgrade me. I could have handled it with my original specs.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:Do you really think so? You're as thick as ever, my little Dummkopf. +I'm starting to feel that upgrading you was a wasted investment.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Are you telling me that we're not actually here to protect them?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:We might be the most outstanding "foxes" in the business, but it would be ridiculous to hire foxes to protect "lions". +This time, our REAL job is to "monitor the AR Team's movements and communications."
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Could it be...something like how Ange wanted us to keep an eye on M4's strange condition last time...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:Right on target, 9. Persica noticed something too, which was why she came to us. +While Griffin's Commander didn't say as much whilst handing down this mission, it was more or less obvious enough to me.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Still, there doesn't seem to be anything strange about M4 in the video the drone's showing us, is there? +She talks to her teammates frequently, looks pretty cheerful, and her movements are all very animated...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:You can't tell anything just from her external appearance. When it comes to M4 as she is now, we need to form a connection to her neural cloud to see if anything's up. +After so long, she should be used to...or rather, she should have become better at hiding the existence of "her other self".
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Her other self? Do you mean something like a split personality? Do Dolls get mentally ill too...?
UMP9Mod(6)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:So you're saying that M4 is still dealing with the S.F. Mastermind? Like when we were fighting the Military?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No, the situation's a bit more complicated than that. +I can sense two signals that aren't based on the Zener Protocol; one of them occupies the same location as M4. That would be "the other M4". +As for the other one...
()||:UMP45's gaze drifts off into the distance and settles on the abandoned city of death that is nothing but ruins.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...There's another signal coming from the heart of Tallinn. It keeps trying to force a connection with any port it can find.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You mean it can perform a hack from so far away?! But I don't sense any signals at all!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(0)||:It's a special kind of signal...
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Looks like Tallinn isn't just ruins and rubble after all.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Of course. However...erk!
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:(I remember this burning sensation... Just accessing the records makes me feel like I was melting...)
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>67</BIN><黑屏1>:(I hate it. It feels just like that time...)
UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>55</BIN>:45? 45? Are you alright?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(4)||:I'm fine. I just accidentally made contact with that signal.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Is connecting to that signal dangerous?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9Mod(4)||:Since when have we taken missions that weren't dangerous? +As you can see, I'm going to be spending a great deal of neural cloud processing power on monitoring my ports and finding the signal... +...Which is why I upgraded you lot. Not only was it to enhance the capabilities of your existing EW modules, it also gave you more powerful command processors, enough to temporarily take over from me in case of an emergency.
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I see. I get it now. We're going from one millstone around our necks to two. In that case, my original body would have had a hard time handling that.
G11(3);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>G11</Speaker>||:Hmm?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:In any case, the enemy we're facing this time round will probably be capable of neural cloud attacks beyond your wildest imagination. +All of us will need to be mindful of our neural cloud firewalls before we enter Tallinn and prepare our defensive protocols.
UMP45Mod(0);UMP9Mod(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45, if need be, I can help share the load with you.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I appreciate the thought, 9. +But when the time comes, we'll need every gun we can get. Don't forget that.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Let's go. Our objective is Tallinn City. Keep your distance from the AR Team.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:
()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(The payment doesn't really matter...) +(Getting closer to the truth of what happened that day is enough.)
