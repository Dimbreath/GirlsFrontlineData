TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Ah, that was...
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:K2. So that's the music that's been holding you captive.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Yeah...I think I am able to log off now.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:It seems that's how El Fail "defines" you.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Define?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:El Fail chooses the kind of music that she thinks would adequately sum up your existence. +The part of your neural cloud that was trapped believed that this song was her everything, which is why she didn't want to leave her cage.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:In other words, the song is what El Fail thinks of me?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:She seems to think pretty highly of you.

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:(Sighs) If you're like this more often, my job would be a lot easier.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Haha...but she HAS seen it. +Besides, one must have a stout heart to be gentle.
