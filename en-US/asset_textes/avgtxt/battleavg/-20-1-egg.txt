M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:"I knew it's gonna be something like this..." - that's how I feel about it. I don't know what else to say.

CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点1>:Uh...I think I'd better introduce you to Fairies with a more positive message... +(Mutters) If TMP ever ran into the NB Rangers, I wonder what kind of weird chemistry they would have... +(Mutters) Nah, I'd rather not think about it.
