FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Miss Rider, I'm giving you one last chance! +Max or Break!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Well...how should I put it... +When I first arrived here, it was awesome. +This place has everything I have ever wanted – music, freedom, infinite joy that transcends time and reality.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Exactly. This is what I want. It's what you want as well, isn't that right? +So why not give it a try? +Let go of everything and enjoy absolute freedom... +Isn't this the ultimate victory in your search for the rock'n'roll spirit?
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Sorry, I think you misunderstand. +Ever since I decided to take on the world, victory has never been my goal. +Otherwise, the moment I achieve absolute freedom, I'd stop being the AEK-999 who isn't content with anything, don't you think?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:...
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:So, that's why I'm not interested in your proposition of blissful ignorance! +There is no Rock'n'Roll in paradise!

CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:What...?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_ShadowFlowerF</BGM>:Oh... this? +It's what happened during our last confrontation. I just woke up and it surfaced on its own.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:AEK... +You're surprisingly eloquent.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Uh... I was really angry and just transitioned into rant mode.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:You don't show this side of yourself very often, AEK.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:(Laughs dryly) Shut up. You make it sound like I enjoy doing this...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:Poetry and Rock'n'Roll, they are one and the same.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:True. AEK might just be a diamond in the rough!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Uh... let's talk about music! +I really like that song. It suits me a lot. Well done, Miss El Fail.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Heh, now you see that I do indeed have incredible taste.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You like it? There are a lot of Fairies like that in Pocket City.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Haha! I'll get to know them all!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Try not to cause trouble when you go biking at night. +This goes for ALL worlds.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Right, I'll remember.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:But you always go too fast.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:Yeah! I always feel like I'm gonna get flung off any second!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:Really...? +I thought only the Commander felt uncomfortable on my motorbike...
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:I'll keep an eye on you. +About this, and about the Commander!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Okaaaay... +I seem to have landed myself in more trouble... +(Chuckles) I suppose this is the cost of loving Rock'n'Roll.
