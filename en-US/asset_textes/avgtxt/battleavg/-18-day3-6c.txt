M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Persica wasn't lying. You have changed.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:The way...you look... +What...happened to you...?!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:What happened to me? +I was captured and brainwashed by Sangvis Ferri. +Unfortunately, that means I have no choice but to fight my former friends. Is this explanation adequate?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...are you talking about...?
()||:M16A1 flashes an enigmatic smile. The smile is unquestionably hers.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'm actually feeling pretty good. Nothing is more reassuring than possessing immense power that I'm free to wield. +Still, the time hasn't come for you to meld, and it wouldn't be wise to stay here any longer... +I'll be...taking Elisa with me.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Wait! You can't take her!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Why? Because the humans said so?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I don't give a damn about why... At least explain yourself!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:She's too dangerous for you right now... No, she's too dangerous for all of us. +It's not time yet.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:If you won't let her go, I'll just have to take her by force!
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh yeah? Perfect. Show me how much you've grown.
