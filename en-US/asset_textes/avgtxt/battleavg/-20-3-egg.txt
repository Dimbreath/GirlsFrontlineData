Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:... +Have you...been waiting this whole time? +For you own name and music?
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Preiya and Camilia. +We finally remember our names and this song. +Thank you. Our endless night is finally over.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:One of you is a Doll.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:That is our fate.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||:I see! +Since one of you is a Doll, you can process memories mechanically. +That's why you remember more than the other Fairies.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||:You made that crazy connection right away, that's our TMP after all.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:My... I honestly didn't consider that. My mistake.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:You're not scared anymore, are you?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:... +I'll be fine.
()||:...Thunder looks at M950A, who nods back.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:No matter what I lose, I've learned to try my utmost best to get it back. +Thank you for keeping me on track and showing me the way.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:You have the courage to step out of the cage to begin with.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:But without your help, I couldn't have done it.
()||:...The twins, Preiya and Camilia, smile a little.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker>Fairy twins</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||:Neither our story nor yours will come to an end tonight. +We look forward to meeting you again in the real world, Miss White Doll.
()||:...The Fairy twins vanish.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Looks like that's gonna be your stage name!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) Even though we're all Dolls.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:I know for a fact that Thunder is no less emotional than anyone. +Do you mind being addressed as such?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||:I don't. In fact, I like this name a lot. +Through this name, I'll remember myself... +And I'll never stop trying to change for the better.
()||:...They all look at each other and share a moment of laughter.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||:What the hell... +But I think I get what you mean. +Let's change together, Thunder.
()||:...Thunder nods.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Alright, we've released everyone! +Oof...that was hard work!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:All the Fairies in Pocket City have got their music back. +It took me a long time to collect them, so it's a bit of a shame.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:You're the one that caused this mess to begin with!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Okay, okay, it was all my fault! +I'll make it up for everyone here in Pocket City. What about you, El Clear?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:I'm going to the real world and help my Doll friends at Griffin. Not to mention the Commander that's been helping me along the way. +I owe everyone too much.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:Heh, that's not bad. My Fairies and I might join you some day. +But make sure your name and your music are loud enough when the time comes.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Of course! Don't slack off yourself. I'll come back and check up on the city every now and then!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||:I don't want to work... +But I don't wanna have my butt handed to me by you Griffins either! +Hey, just kidding! I simply don't want to be looked down on in the real world.
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Humph, I have no trouble believing that.
()||:...El Clear and El Fail wave at each other.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||:Have you said everything you want?
CLEAR(0)<Speaker>El Clear</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<黑点1>:Yeah... +Please take me to reality! +I want to meet your friends, your Commander, more music, and a bigger world!
