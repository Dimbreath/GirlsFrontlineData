()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN>:In an empty white virtual space, countless girls with identical faces surround and attack UMP45. +Squad 404 helps 45 hold off the enemy attack from the outside.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:45! Don't let them touch you— +I saw it, just now... The places where they walked on vanished!
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk...they're trying to fuse with M4A1's neural cloud. +Looks like I can't go offline yet.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Huh? Then what are you going to do? We can only buy you a bit more time!
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:9, do you see that progress bar over there? I'm trying to visualize the situation for you. M4A1's own systems will help to maintain her neural cloud's stability. The progress bar will grow longer as her neural cloud becomes more stable. +Once it fills up, I'll be able to log off. +Make sure you don't let it empty out, or we'll be in big trouble.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45Mod(0)||:Okay...but the progress bar decreases a little every time they show up...
UMP9Mod(0);UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's why I need you to help me get rid of these annoying pests. +Also, we need to take care not to harm M4A1's neural cloud... If her neural cloud breaks down, we won't be able to get out of this in one piece!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Got it, 45! Alright, let's begin the operation!
