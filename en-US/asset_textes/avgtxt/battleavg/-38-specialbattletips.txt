Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Oh, Signore Giuseppe is here! Buongiorno! +Please give me lots of guidance in today's training as always!
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Right, that's it! +Cyborgs aren't the only ones who take part in battles; their Handlers are also present on the field in person, that's why they have even more experience in combat than the Cyborgs.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Each Handler gives personal guidance to their own Cyborg during their routine training to foster better coordination between the two.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:The training program hasn't changed much. It's just my usual target practice. +Get into position, now fire...
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Oh, there you are.
Henrietta(0)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Buongiorno, Rico. +Are you here on your own?
Rico(0)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Signore Jean is out on some business so the Agency asked me to come and train with you.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Now you have two students. +Henrietta knows the drill pretty well, but Rico will need a few pointers from you.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Still, I'm sure you're very familiar with this kind of training, right? +Here's the score-keeping system. You fail if you don't meet the score requirement after using up all your rounds... +You won't disappoint your devoted little girls, will you? Don't be careless, Commander!
