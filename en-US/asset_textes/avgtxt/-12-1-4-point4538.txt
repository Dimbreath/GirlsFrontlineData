But I don't think I'm ready yet... +Hasn't your accuracy gone up to 60% already? +That's all thanks to you, 40. +Hahaha, you're right. I'm the best teacher there is! +Of course I'm happy that they're sending me on missions, but that could be dangerous. We'll be fighting with live rounds, after all... +It'll be fine! I'm not particularly strong, but I'll do everything to protect you if you're ever in danger! +Really? +Haha, of course! I'm sure you'll do the same if I'm in danger, right? +Yeah, that's right... I'll also protect you, 40! +Though it's more likely that we'll both end up getting killed... Our fault for being so weak, hahaha... +Getting killed together...doesn't sound so bad. +Huh? +If the neural cloud is intact, we may get a new body! +A new...body? +Yeah, then we'll no longer be held back by our own body, and no one will ever look down on us again! +Oooooh! You're right! That'll be awesome! +Still...we aren't advanced T-Dolls so the commander probably won't be bothered to get us new bodies. +Well, it doesn't hurt to dream. If we somehow do something worthy of recognition out there, that'll show them, right? Then surely we can request for new bodies, hmm? +Yeah...we can do it. +Great! Then it's decided. One day, we'll accomplish a mission that's impossible for anyone else! Then we'll get the best bodies they could possibly build, and no one will ever look down on us again!
