56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:What...are we even doing...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:(Sighs)...+All that fighting has made me even hungrier...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Even this base has been looted...+We're guarding a kitchen but have nothing to eat... How sad...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Say, Chief... Can't we go?+Hasn't the Commander cleared the way already?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, but it isn't time yet. We can't move until there's a gap in the enemy's patrols.+A Sangvis Ringleader is lurking in the area, and according to intel, she's in control of a Jupiter...+If we expose our presence, not only will we be screwed, even the neighboring human settlements will suffer.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Tsk. How long do we have to wait...?+Why should we starve for humans' sake...?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Hey, has your empty stomach driven you mad? How dare you even say such a thing...+Many people are still waiting at home for the emergency rations we're delivering...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:But the problem is...+Those humans aren't actually short on food...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Huh? What do you mean?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Those supplies...are actually ingredients for the rich to throw banquets with...+They're all of top quality. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been looted so thoroughly.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><震屏>:What?! Then why didn't you say so?!+So we've been risking our lives and starving ourselves all this way just to move leftovers for the moneybags?!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:I was gonna bring this up when we got there. We could even ask for some if we're lucky...+But at this point, we're going nowhere anyway. Why don't we sneak a bite first...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<震屏>:Hey, don't do it!+Once again, a mission is a mission. We can't unpack others' goods for our own use!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:I also think it's a good idea to bear with it for now and wait till we break through the enemy's blockade...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:But how are we supposed to fight when we're starving to death...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:That's right! The body is the capital for revolution!+Besides, there's only this much left of what we can deliver, and we've been delayed. We'll get scolded even if we make the delivery...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:It's gonna be hell if we go, and it's gonna be hell if we eat up the goods. It's gonna be hell either way, I'd rather go to hell on a full stomach!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What kind of argument is that...+Though...you do have a point. Imagine the shame of losing a battle because of hunger...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hey, not you too...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Chief, this is three against one.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ugh...
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:……
NZ75()<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Now listen. Let's get our story straight. If they ask, we say the goods were lost on the way.
Type97S()<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:As long as we're all in this together, nothing can stop us. Let's go!
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Is this really the time to quote lyrics...+And I'll allow only one pack - no more than that!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM><BIN>4</BIN><Night>:Haha, don't worry! These will be enough to cheer us up!+I have a huge piece of pork here. Still fresh! What about the vegetables, 97?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Hey, take a look at this persimmon! So red and fleshy. As expected of the city dwellers' food!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Tsk. That's a tomato. What a country bumpkin. Can't even tell them apart, huh.+Remember that time when they asked you to bring back some persimmons and you came back with dried persimmon pastries. Type56R took a nibble and couldn't stomach anything else for the rest of the day.+The only good cooks are Type64 and Type88, but 64 keeps hurting herself in the kitchen...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:She's way too delicate. That little princess can cut three of her fingers just popping a can open...+Besides, they may be good at cooking, but they don't use proper ingredients!+Miss 88 makes mapo tofu with tofu pudding! 63 was so pissed she just left!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:So that's why 63 threw a fit that time? I had never seen her so angry...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:63 is also a blockhead herself... The only sort of seasoning she knows how to use is raw chilli!+You know how picky 92 is when it comes to Sichuan cuisine. If she saw that, she'd kick 63 right out of the kitchen!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hey...I didn't know you bunch have so many issues. You all seem fine working together...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<震屏>:I can put up with anything that comes up during work, but sacrilege against proper cookery is unacceptable!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||<震屏>:Are you really one to talk?+You approved quite heartily that time when NZ put ketchup onto sweet and sour pork!+If I were Chief, I'd send you over to eat potatoes every day with Miss Lee Enfield and Sten!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Huh? Was that NZ?+That tasted really nice, you know. Much better than your so-called "proper" sweet and sour pork...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:What?! You couldn't taste the ketchup?! Is something wrong with your stomach or your tongue?!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<震屏>:You mean YOUR tongue, stupid fat hawk! Have all the walnuts you ate yesterday gone to your brain?!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Listen!+Stop fighting, guys! We finally decided to all work together. It's not worth it to start another argument over nothing but a dish...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Chief, that's why you always lose out - you let things pass all the time...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:And what do you mean "nothing but a dish"?! You know nothing about sweet and sour pork!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:Uh, sweet and sour pork... Isn't that just ribs seasoned with sugar and vinegar?
()||<BIN>9</BIN>:...+......
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Why...have you all suddenly gone quiet?
NZ75()<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Just run, Chief. Hawk's gonna break your tiny body bone by bone any second now...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Uh...Hawk, what's with the creepy smile? Cut it out...
Type97S()<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Chief, I've been sincerely happy hanging out with you these days...+But sadly, sweet and sour pork is sweet and sour pork. Not ketchup. Not sugar or vinegar either...
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hey, Hawk! What are you doing?! S-Stay away!
NZ75()<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:H-Hold on! Is that an engine I'm hearing?!
Type56-1()<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:It's Jupiter! Duck!
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1>:...BOOM!
()||<BIN>41</BIN><火花><黑屏2>:...
NZ75()<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Cough...+Hey, is everyone alright?!
M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Cough, we're fine... We're all in the bunker. Only the kitchen collapsed...
Type97S()<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Come again?!
NZ75()<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:K...+Kit...chen...?
Type97S()<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:56! 56, are you alright?!

Type56-1()<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1><关闭火花>:...+Gone...+It's all...gone...
