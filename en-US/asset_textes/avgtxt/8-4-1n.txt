AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +It must've slipped your mind that these Sangvis communication devices most definitely contain the Parapluie virus. If you become infected...
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:You'll take over as the leader of this squad. +If I'm the only one who has to suffer, then so be it.
AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I'll only cover for you temporarily, or are you trying to advertise how replaceable you are?
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +G17 and SSG are putting themselves in great danger. If you don't want to watch me being rewritten...
AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I object. +Whatever they're going through can't be worse than what you're doing to yourself here.
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:The poisonous substance on my remains... means I was in direct contact with the cargo, right?
AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +If it wasn't for the intel you acquired and requested of me to deliver back to base, we wouldn't have uncovered any of this.

IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Then why did you ask SSG to search for our remains?
AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:I made a promise.
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:A promise?
AUG()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:There's something we have to take back.

IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +Understood. Then I'm leaving it to you. +Let's go, AUG. Is the warning message for the Commander ready?
()<Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:The moment you send it out will be when I despise you the most. +...Bad timing.
IWS2000()<Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:What?
