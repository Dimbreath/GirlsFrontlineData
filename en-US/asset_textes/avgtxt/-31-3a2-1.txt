()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:...Five minutes later.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Phew... ELIDs are pretty easy to deal with. They're just a bit...gross. +But our friends in the back are starting to falter. The enemies are pressing in...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm just glad that you've killed off the one that looked like a Nyto...
NPC-Nimogen(0)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:You really think I'd be killed so easily?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏>:Whoa! +You scared the crap outta me! +How can you still be alive?! Didn't I blow you up into pieces?!
NPC-Nimogen(0)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||<>:I would've wiped out all of you right now, but to make Father happy, I must wait till I'm done with more important business. 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:With that, an object is launched into the truck. Smoke rapidly spreads through the vehicle.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BIN>86</BIN><黑屏2>:Cough, cough cough... It's a smoke grenade! +RO, are you back in the truck?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<震屏>:...! +Madam! Crap, the Chairwoman is gone!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They just won't let us go!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Clad in black, Nimogen stands proudly at the end of the road, as if waiting to be seen. +She looks in the direction in which the smoke grenade was launched, a cold and sadistic smile on her face.
NPC-Nimogen(0)<Speaker>Nimogen</Speaker>||:Heeheehee, we can finally begin, Mercurows. We've kept Father waiting for too long.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Then she vanishes from the Griffin Dolls' view along with the unconscious Chairwoman.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:SOP-II, we must get the Chairwoman back! +No matter the cost! We must hurry!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Meanwhile. +In the office of the Bureau of State Security.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Ring—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zelinsky sits primly in the center of his not particularly well-lit office, staring at the telephone that's emitting an unpleasant ring. +He frowns deeply and dreads having to answer this phone call. After all, it is obvious that this call won't bring any good news.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The line would probably have disconnected in another two seconds, but Zelinsky still decides to pick up. +On the other end of the call is a voice that Zelinsky finds absolutely odious.
神秘男子()<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What took you so long to answer the phone? I almost thought Statesec was raided by some new secret faction.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Glad to see I was just being paranoid.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:...It isn't funny. +Just say it. What do you want?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I just acquired a fantastic bargaining chip...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Your guest is currently enjoying my hospitality.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you want her alive, give me access to Base 22.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:I don't know what you're talking about.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>She's such an important diplomat... Is it really okay if she dies?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Humans are so fragile when they're at the mercy of these weapons⁠—</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:(Interrupts) Statesec doesn't negotiate with terrorists.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Ha, I see. So you never really cared if that woman lives or dies.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Which means that's not the point for you... Hmm, I see. You have some other objective, don't you, Mr. Chief?</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:...Like I said, I haven't a clue what you're going on about. Stop this nonsense.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Chief of Statesec is leaning slightly forward in agitation. He fights the urge to punch himself on the thigh with his clenched left fist and blurts out a crass denial. +The tense silence hanging in the air makes him restless. He fervently wishes the mysterious man would just say something, but... +He also knows that nothing good will come out of his mouth.
神秘男子()<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know exactly what you want. I also know exactly what Statesec is after.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:...
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It's more convenient for you if you just leave certain things to us, don't you think?</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:Who...exactly are you?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Me? Ha, surely you can hazard a guess?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I have been through a lot more than you, Chief.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>My connections and intelligence network have also extended to places where even Statesec cannot reach.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I know you are trying to trace my location. I suggest you save your efforts.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>You won't get a clue even if I give you another decade to trace me, so let's not waste each other's time. Just give me the security code for Base 22. The Chairwoman will be yours, and you can take all the credit. Why, you can even have the locations of the other 13 bases.</color>
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zelinsky is rendered speechless. With clenched teeth, he stares at a single point in space and frantically rummages through his brain for whatever tiny detail of that particular period of time he might have forgotten.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||:How do I know I can trust you?
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because you have no other choice. Either we both remain empty-handed, or we can work together for the time being. Hahaha, that's right, a temporary partnership.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Zelinsky grows even more uneasy. Even through the digital distortion, he can hear the sudden chill in the mysterious man's voice.
神秘男子()<Speaker>Mysterious Man</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>This conversation has gone on for long enough, Chief Zelinsky.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I suppose the one thing that time hasn't been able to teach me is patience...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So give me an answer soon. This isn't an offer...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>But an order.</color>
