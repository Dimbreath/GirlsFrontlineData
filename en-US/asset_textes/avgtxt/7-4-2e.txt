PM(0)<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：According to 16LAB's analysis, Dreamer has been operating through her dummy this whole time.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：As expected... She still has a lot of aces up her sleeve...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Still...she's nothing but a hypocritical coward...+In any case, we made it back, so it's a job well done. We can all relax for the time being.
AAT52(0)<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：We're heading out for a big dinner tonight. You coming, RO?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Uh... You guys go on ahead. I have to talk to M16 and SOP-II.+Let's say our goodbyes here. See you around.
MK2(0)<Speaker>Sten MK-2</Speaker>||：Hmm... So our squad won't be dissolved, right?+Even though Miss RO is in another team, we're still members of Squad Palette, aren't we?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：That's right, we are companions for life.+The higher-ups have promised to preserve the serving records of Squad Palette for us.+And if I ever need help, you'll be the first to know.

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>：So...+I read the report. How was the program? Did it work?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Uh...+Sort of... It was a bit awkward to work with, but we got the hang of it.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：That hacking program...was coded from a Sangvis authorization module.+We only managed to crack it last month...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Ah...now that you mention it...+That's what the AR Team risked their lives to get in Safe House 3, isn't it?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Hmm... Kind of...+They're all...relics from the past...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Relics...? You humans are such troublemakers...+That's why we're having so much trouble...
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：(Chuckles) Solving our trouble is what motivated us to develop Doll-making technology in the first place.+By the way...why is your voice all mumbly?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Mmm...+I had a couple of drinks with M16...+Would you like to talk to her?

NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：...+I'm sure M4 will be fine...+As for AR-15... I'm still working on it...+What about you, RO? Are you okay?+I was really worried...you know...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：I know...+I must become even stronger than AR-15 in order to avenge her.+I can't wait to prove myself...
