<Speaker>???</Speaker>()||:...Let's put it this way, Negev. +If today was to be your last day... If it's gonna be over for you today, what would you do?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I... +I'm not sure... +I'd probably give myself a holiday. Read in the dorm, listen to some music, and water my flowers.
<Speaker>???</Speaker>()||:Water your flowers... So you like flowers too?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Well, I'm not crazy about them. It's just a hobby.
<Speaker>???</Speaker>()||:How leisurely of you... Wouldn't you want to make up for some of your regrets?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Regrets? With the precious little time I have left? Why?
<Speaker>???</Speaker>()||:Don't you have any regrets?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:She once said... +"If someone tells the whole world 'I love you' on their very last day, they're lying."
<Speaker>???</Speaker>()||:But you never know how to lie, I know.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I just want to be myself, Jericho... The closer I am to dying, the more I want that.
()||:...Jericho chuckles with great difficulty in the shadows.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:That's exactly why I chose you... +To be my adjutant...over them...
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I don't know... +If I've actually made myself useful...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Goes without saying that you've only been dragging us down ever since you joined us.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Yeah, I'm "a piece of junk with zero self-control". Your exact words.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Humph... +Let's talk about something else. Something lighter.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Is the 【Test】 still not over? +Is this really necessary, Jericho? It's been two hours. If the rescue party still can't get to us, we'll...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:The rescue party can't get to us. That's exactly why we should have a chat.
()||:...Negev takes a slow, deep breath.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:... +Could this be...the final step of the 【Test】?
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Is there any other choice? Even I can't think of anything else, not to mention you. +So, how have you been doing at Griffin recently?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:(Sighs) You said you wanted to discuss a lighter subject...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I'm sure you're keeping something from me.
()||:...Negev falls silent for a while and finally sighs.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Fine. There's no hiding from you. I was planning to tell you at a more proper occasion. +A week ago, my squad carried out a major operation for the Commander.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Wait, YOUR squad? You're my adjutant.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:It was temporary. I was ordered to lead a mission in Area S05 during your last recovery.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2>:Area S05? That's not a very nice place.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Well, it was no better than the hellholes you've led us into. +Plus, I've taken an enemy head-on that even you would find surprising.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:You encountered the Mastermind?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||:One of her aces.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:And you lived? You expect me to believe a little girl like you defeated a Sangvis Elite and survived? +Go on then, tell me all about it. I want to know.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Ah, there it is again. Miss Jericho's infamous "not really the best time".
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I'm still your leader here. I won't go easy on you.
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Yeah, you've always been terrifying, even with your body like this...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Even if there's nothing left of it but my head, you have to obey me. As I've said before -
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I know, I know. "You're mine. All my subordinates are mine."
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:And come closer. I can't hear you very well anymore.
()||<黑屏1>:...Negev sits up and shifts over.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Now, where do we start?
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Start from when you hopped off the carrier. Skip over the part where you received your orders like a hotshot.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Tsk... Shame... +After receiving my orders, I led my subordinates off the carrier... Then... +Let me think...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:You must've made a fool of yourself.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:No, back then...I was...
()<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Negev?
()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh, right. Galil called my name...
AR(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:...Negev. Negev?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:...Huh?
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Don't "huh" me. What are you spacing out for?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Back then, I was spacing out.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:See? Told ya.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:I like thinking. Or have you forgotten?
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:Yeah, I have. What happened then? What did Galil say?
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:Same old things. Rambling on and worrying about everything. And ended up being right about everything.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Focus, Negev. Can't you take this a bit more seriously?
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Ha, I was just thinking about something.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Huh? Even you "think"? What was it that you said? That famous quote of yours? "Thinking..."
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:"Thinking is for idiots. Prodigies need only their ingenuity." +But this is an important mission. I'm just being extra cautious.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Cautious? Ha, ha. Look at me, Negev. +Let me see how you define "cautious".
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Being cautious means I want you to help me with recon.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Give me a route that'll allow me to finish mapping out the area without dying. Then I'll go.
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Humph, you make it sound like a challenge for me.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||:Might not be for you, not sure about our superior. Don't make trouble for the Commander.
AR(0);NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Everything is up to fate. I'm just an enforcer.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>;NEGEV(0)||<黑屏1>:Lovely. More Negev-esque quotes... Yep, you're still you. +I'm off to make my prep. Contact the Commander.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:I didn't know you can be so cocky.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||:Being self-assured and being cocky are two different things. +Any T-Doll will become an elite under your hellish training.
<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>()||:IF she survives it.
<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>()||<黑屏1>:That's why I'm the only elite. +As I've promised, I'll make it till the very end.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2>:...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||:Good evening, Commander. Did you sleep well? I hope you've adjusted your biorhythm properly. +Have you finished reading the mission brief? +...Hey, is that a yawn? I told you to fix your body clock, didn't I? +...I don't want to hear your excuses. Go wash your face and let's begin the operation.
()||<黑点1>:...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑点2>:Feeling better, Commander? Can we start? +This mission is highly dangerous. We're heading deep into Sangvis territory to retrieve something. Conflict with S.F. is probable. +The Ringleader presiding over the area is still unidentified, but don't worry. Just listen to my advice. +As a Griffin elite, it's my job to help you achieve victory. Trust me. +Now let's be on our way!
