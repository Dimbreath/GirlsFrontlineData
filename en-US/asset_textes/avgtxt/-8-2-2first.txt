FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:How are things ahead? Still not done?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Non, not time yet! Intruder really is a handful!
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:All we can do is slightly reduce her strength, but we're far from actually neutralizing her.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:I suggest we retreat for the time being, FAL. Wait for her supplies to deplete.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Can't be helped. Break it off for now. I'll put together the next round of offensive ASAP!
