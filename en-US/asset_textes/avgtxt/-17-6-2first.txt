()||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...Task Force DEFY continues breaking through the lockdown toward the repeater station. +Meanwhile, M4A1 looks silently at AR-15 as she adjusts her gear in the darkness.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM><BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I guess you're not going to let the matter go, are you?
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Do you have something to tell me?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:... +It was a forcefield.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.6</黑屏1><BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Hmm?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>36</BIN><黑屏2>0.6</黑屏2>:That day... +The moment the explosives went off, Mastermind created a forcefield around me. +I somehow managed to survive, although most of my body was blown to bits.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>36</BIN>:But then...how did you get out of that place...?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>36</BIN><黑屏1>:Ange's T-Dolls rescued me. +I went through a whole mess of things after that, but in the end...I was fixed.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑屏2>:AR-15 sighs and looks at her wrists, which she dextrously rotates.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:They also upgraded me along the way, and that's about it...
AR15Mod(3);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...That's it? +You've always been like this. You've always loved to hide and burrow yourself away. +Did you know that back then, all of us thought that you...you...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:They had to shut down all my external interfaces in order to curb the Parapluie still within my body. +I spent a long, long time lying down for servicing in an underground room where I couldn't even see the sun, so don't ask why I didn't contact you.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...If you had come back earlier, a lot of things wouldn't have ended up like they did now. +At least we could have...gone back to how things used to be...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:That's just wishful thinking on your part, M4A1. +When I woke up, I was told that my neural cloud had been heavily altered thanks to Parapluie... +Part of that involved deleting my original principal order.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Principal order... What's that?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...AR-15 gazes intently at M4A1.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Everything I did had protecting you as my top priority, even if it meant sacrificing myself.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:You should have sensed it too, right? +This was our original principal order... Not just for me, but the other members of the AR Team as well... +That was why everyone fought so hard for your sake.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Did that order...make you feel very uncomfortable?
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I just thought it was stupid. +Good thing it was deleted. I'm no longer bound by this order. Perhaps, technically speaking, I am free. +And so, after going through all that, I won't risk my life to protect you anymore.
AR15Mod(3);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:Right now, I'm no longer like how I was in the AR Team. +Are you still planning to take risks even with someone like me at your side?
AR15Mod(3);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:But of course. That's completely irrelevant. +Or rather, it might be for the better that nothing can force you to do anything anymore. +...It also makes me feel less burdened.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:You've really changed, M4A1. I think it's for the better.
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:But I still haven't figured out why Mastermind would save you...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:I don't know either. Perhaps... +Our orders to destroy Sangvis Ferri, or perhaps everything else, aren't as simple as we thought. +Even though we're still enemies with all the Sangvis units that we see, the enemies behind us...
AR15Mod(4);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:It doesn't matter. Clearing obstacles from my path has always been the way of things. +I just want to know who really needs to die. That's enough for me.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...M4A1 gets to her feet and walks off.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:...For a moment... +There was an icy gleam in M4A1's eyes.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>7</BIN><Night>:(She has changed... )+(But is it really for the better?)
