NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sorry, it doesn't have anything to do with our last case either.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:S-Still, quiet days aren't so bad. Plus, the pay is very good!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:According to our sources, Sangvis troops didn't evacuate immediately after Scarecrow's destruction.+They've formed into several guerrilla squads and remained active in Griffin territory.+Their objective is unclear. At the very least, they haven't taken the initiative to attack us up to this point.+However, we can't just sit here and do nothing. Chase them away, Commander!
