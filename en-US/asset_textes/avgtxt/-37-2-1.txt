G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<BIN>239</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I didn't realize the mansion was this huge until I saw it up close.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:You say it's abandoned, but it doesn't look like it's rotting at all.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:MDR, did the mansion look the same the last time you came?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I dunno. +I was only here for recon. I didn't get this close to the building. +According to the accounts given by the local residents, someone seems to have entered the mansion in the past, but no one has heard from them ever since. +For safety's sake, I left once I ascertained that the noises do exist.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:56-1 is right. For an abandoned building, it is in extraordinarily good condition. +You can hardly see anything through the gloom from outside the windows, but it doesn't smell of decay either. +Even the doormat outside the main entrance is squeaky clean. I honestly find it hard to believe this mansion is uninhabited. +But the plants and mosses are growing rampantly on the porch with no sign of having been disturbed, so no one has entered or left the building for quite a while.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Wow... That's some impressive observation skills. +You seem a lot more animated than you usually are?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:It's elementary inductive reasoning.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:You're different than what I imagined. +The posts on the anon forum say you're the taciturn type.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Your impression on most Dolls isn't the most accurate. +You shouldn't put too much faith in the information you obtain from the internet.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Inductive reasoning, eh...? This does seem like  the perfect setting for a detective novel.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Don't jinx it... It's not like any murder is gonna take place. +How should we get in?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Through the front door. If the reclusive master of the house is actually living within the walls, we can't forget our manners.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:So we're knocking...?
()||<SE1>AVG_doorknock_wood</SE1>:Gr G36c walks up to the main entrance. Looming over her small stature, the heavy wooden door looks very imposing.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:I expected as much, but there really is no answer. +Well? Should we turn back?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Manners aside, we can't forfeit the mission.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:True. Besides, if I can somehow get a paranormal picture, it'll cause quite a stir on the forum. +Gr G36c, can you open the door?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Let me check. If it's locked, I can try hacking into...
()||:Click— +The door sudden opens slowly inward all by itself. Gr G36c freezes for a moment, not comprehending what just happened.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Oh my...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What's this? Are we being invited inside?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I'm not detecting any electronic activity. Is there some sort of mechanism in the door?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Or it could be a ghost.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Whatever it was, if the door is open wide for us, we have no reason to turn down the invitation.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Right, let's go then!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><黑点2>:The mansion looks spooky from the outside, but it looks pretty normal in here.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The internal structure is exactly like any other house. +But don't forget – this mansion has allegedly been abandoned for over a decade. +This state of orderliness where even the electrical installations are still fully functional and all the lights are still on in the hallways...  +There's nothing "normal" about it.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Without a whole team of household staff or a single Miss Gr G36, it's impossible to maintain this level of cleanliness in such a big mansion. +But we haven't seen a single person since the moment we came in, nor do we know who opened the door for us. +...This is turning out to be a real thriller. The kind that sends chills running down your spine.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:At least we can be certain that this mansion does have an inhabitant. We simply don't know why they aren't showing themselves. +In any case, we have to find them first. However, the scope of our search is limited if we stick together. +Let's agree on a meet-up point and spread out.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Now that you mention a meet-up point...don't you think that door over there looks slightly different than the other ones?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Go and take a look, Gr G36c.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Sure.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:We'll cover you, so don't worry.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:If a ghost comes popping out from behind, make sure you do something to save me.
()||:Gr G36c approaches the door at the end of the hallway and opens it carefully.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Report, Gr G36c. What's behind the door?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Hmm...well... +I don't really know how to describe it. You'd better come see for yourselves... +Oh, and no suspicious beings discovered. It's safe.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Ooooh, the mystery. +Don't tell me it's the chocolate factory where a troop of Oompa-Loompas make choc... Wow.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...A church?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Who'd have thought there would be church in the middle of a mansion?
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:If there really is a ghost, then they sure have an awful sense of humor to live in a church.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Look, over there.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see... So that's the origin of the legend about the ghost bride?
()||:On the alter, right beneath the statue, there are a lot of wedding dresses on display. +These dresses surrounding the statue are all of unique design, and the handiwork is so exquisite even the T-Dolls can appreciate the tailor's extraordinary skills. +If they were being worn by actual brides and not merely displayed on hangers, they would be even more stunning.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:What kinda guy could have so many brides all at once? Must be quite a stud. +If the Commander did this...the forum would have a field day.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:This seems to be the central point of the mansion. Let's use this as our meet-up point and start our investigation.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Even if we spread out, we don't have enough people to cover all the grounds, don't you think?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:We didn't have enough information and miscalculated the size of the building. +We don't have to push ourselves too hard to attain results. Just come back and meet up in about an hour.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Are we all going off alone?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What if something happens to us?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:If the situation calls for it, you're authorized to open fire. +The moment we hear a shot fired, we make for the source of the sound immediately.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Roger that.
MDR(0)<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||:Got it.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Understood.
