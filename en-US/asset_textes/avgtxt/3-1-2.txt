M16(3);M4A1(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:M16! What happened?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(3)||:A few Sangvis units are very close by. I'll have to turn off the comm soon.
M16(3);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Then long story short, I got away and am currently working under a commander.+Our troops are stationed near the frontline. We can provide backup for you whenever you need it.+M16, how is the AR team doing?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:We got separated when I was bringing up the rear. But they were safe the last time we got in touch.+Leave me for now, M4A1. Find AR-15 and SOP-II first.

M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||<黑屏1>:Sorry, they're coming. We'll talk next time.+Don't worry. We'll meet again.
