 ()||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:...Arrived at the second check point.
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Um... Is anybody here?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Oh, it's MP5! Welcome!
P7(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Hello, Miss P7.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Hello, hello. It must've been a tough journey for you! Come sit down and have some snacks!
P7(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh... Th-Thank you...
MP5()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Pffft!!+Th-This tastes like...!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hahaha! It's my special tasty pie!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Stop pulling my leg. I have eaten a lot of pies and none of them tasted like this!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Tee-hee. This is a recipe I learned from Miss 56-1. It's a local specialty from her homeland.+An exquisite delicacy with five types of nuts, only eaten on a particularly full moon every year.
P7(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:So what are the five types of nuts...in this pastry?
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Well... I've forgotten the recipe, so I just made do with five types of pepper and some cheese powder.
P7(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Hold on. Pepper is not even a kind of nut!+And...why does the cheese powder taste like strawberries?!
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Well...56-1 said I needed to add something called "rock sugar".+I don't know what that is, so I just threw in some strawberry ice cream.+It was the last scoop, too. I spent an awful lot of effort to 'serve' you, you know!
P7(0);MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:(Whimpers) ...P7 really is a prankster.+But...I still have a job to do. I cannot let my emotions take over.+Here are some supplies from Miss G36. A large can of iced juice.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||:Humph. It's red. Tomato juice?+G36 is trying to make me drink that horrid stuff again. Like I'd fall for it.+Do not worry. I have a straw here. Just take a little sip. You can turn it down if you really don't like it.
P7(0)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>;MP5(0)||<黑屏1>:Hmm. All right, just a sip...
P7()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Pffft!! W-What the heck is this?!+Cough! That's not tomato juice! It's something even worse! So spicy! My throat!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:She is actually rolling on the ground. It looks very effective.+This is vegetable juice squeezed from a kind of super spicy chilly called 'viper'. Just a sip has the effect of a tear gas grenade.+Miss G36 said to let you drink it if you prank me with weird things.
P7()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:How could you do this to me?! That's so mean! I'm tearing up like mad!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:She also said to give you the iced tomato juice if you behave. I can let you have it right now if you want.
P7()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Don't even think about making me drink that gross stuff! I want ice cream! Strawberry ice cream!
MP5()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:Have you forgotten? You used up the last scoop to prank me.
P7()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:(Sobs) How did this happen...?
MP5()<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:That is the recon report on the desk, right? Mission accomplished. I shall take my leave.
P7()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Wait! Cough... Please hold on a sec! MP5! Big Sis MP5!+(Sobs) T-Tomato juice...please...
