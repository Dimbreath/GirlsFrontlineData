()||<BIN>41</BIN><SE1>Battlefield</SE1><BGM>BGM_SpecialOPS</BGM>：...+Three minutes later, location targeted by Sangvis artillery.
Makarov()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：Bozhe moy...+Are you star-spangled T-Dolls all this prone to heroics?
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Haha...+Probably. We're never known for our levelheadedness...
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Ah, you're finally smiling, RO.+I thought you'd changed after joining the AR Team.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Well...+The AR Team has very different dynamics. It's easy to become affected without realizing it...
Makarov()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：(Sighs) That's why it's a surprise you guys managed to survive this long...+Always doing such crazy things. I'm not just talking about AR-15... You...+You lot...can actually die, you know...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>：Carpe diem, I guess. We succeeded though, at least for this time.
Makarov()<Speaker>Makarov</Speaker>||：Humph, just barely.+But you did manage to make yourself useful as a team leader.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Sighs) You have no idea how troublesome our operation was...+Thank goodness Miss Persica's hacking program is working. The muzzle velocity of the last shot was indeed significantly weakened.+Thanks everyone. Sten and AAT, thank you for helping us in taking over all the bases surrounding the mortar.
AAT52()<Speaker>AAT-52</Speaker>||：Heheh. With that, The Jupiter mortar's power will be greatly impaired.+So Sangvis Ferri's new toy isn't invincible after all!
MK2 ()<Speaker>STEN MkⅡ</Speaker>||：But...what about Makarov and the others?+They're hurt and pinned down, not to mention Dreamer's troops are still searching for them...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：(Stands up) Let's meet up with them first, and I'll contact the commander.+Don't worry. Everyone will be fine.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Commander, this is RO635.+We have successfully neutralized Sangvis Ferri's mortar. It poses no more threat to us.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：However, we might encounter Dreamer and her forces along our retreat route.+Please keep us safe, Commander. I'll see you back at Griffin Control.
