()||<BIN>2</BIN><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Combat over. Squad Negev safe for the time being.
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Phew... Finally, it's over.+Thanks, Commander. We've troubled you many times already.+But this area is still filled with Sangvis forces. Don't let down your guard, guys.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:Hey... Has any of you seen M16?+She should've collected SOP-II long ago, right? Why isn't she back yet?
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:She must've got information on M4 or AR-15 and didn't want us to get involved?
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||:Dammit! All these rule breakers!+Turn on your comms and search for them!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:Sorry... I'm not reading any of their signals.+Seriously... It's so dangerous here. She should've moved out the moment she realized comms are being jammed...
NEGEV(0)<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
Negev()<Speaker>Negev</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Unless...the jam happens to be what she's after...
()||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑屏1>:Meanwhile...+...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>38</BIN><黑屏2>:In that case, I'm your first friend.+Argh... This sucks.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You are...AR-15?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Oh? You know me?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Your firearm...matches the description of T-Doll AR-15's in my memory module.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is that so...
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You do not...seem very happy?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'm not unhappy.+Making friends with you is the first order I was given. Displaying enthusiasm is also part of the order.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But...if you are happy, should you not smile?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+Then order me to smile. Give me an order, and I'll do it.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You want me to...give you an order?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Give me an order. Order me to do whatever you want me to do.+This is your prerogative, M4A1. Everything is prepared for your sake.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...

M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is...my memory?
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Yes, M4A1 of Griffin.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>16</BIN>:This is your very first memory.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who are you?! What are you doing?!
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Looking for the answer to the question just now.+The answer to the question...of who you really are.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I am a T-Doll under the employment of Griffin and a member of the AR Team.+Other than that, I do not know how else to answer.
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Sure enough, the memory in your neural cloud completely mirrors that of AR-15.+But this isn't what I want. So c'mon, tell me the answer.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I told you. I do not know...
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:How can you not know the reason you were made?+Tell me! C'mon, tell me!
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<震屏><BIN>9</BIN>:I do not know!+I don't know the freaking answer! You jerk! Freak!+Who the hell are you?! Leave me alone!!
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Why are you angry?+Why can't you treat me nicely like everyone else?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Because she really doesn't know the answer.+The neural clouds of the AR Team members have all been encrypted by 16Lab. Many files are not accessible even to ourselves.+Looks like the information regarding M4 is one of them. I can't read them even through Parapluie...
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:...In other words, you've failed to bring me information about M4A1.+You've broken your end of the deal, AR-15 of Griffin...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I told you right from the start that this most likely won't work...
()||<黑屏2>:Clap! Clap!
??()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...I despise oath breakers.+Go, Alchemist. The authorization is now yours.+Take M4A1. The rest is dispensable.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:You hear that, AR-15?+You have M4A1 with you, right? Then we'll meet very soon...+At long last, I can do you in with my own hands!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Alchemist...+Don't get ahead of yourself, you won't get what you want so easily.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But you have nowhere else to go, AR-15...+You know that better than anyone else, right? As the first experimental subject of Plan Parapluie, and...+...The source of this signal jam.+Before long, you'll regret not delivering M4A1 to us while you can...+Soon...
