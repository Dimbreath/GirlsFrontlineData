AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:The contamination index in this area is falling! There must be a safe spot ahead!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Hurry, Ange! Keep running! We're almost there!
AK12(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Heading towards something. That's what Ange has been doing all along.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange?
AK12(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...But she has never felt so lost before.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Ange...

AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Didn't you hear her, AK-12? +She wants us...to kill her.

AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, Ange's radiation sickness escalated and became rampant. We obeyed her dying wish and put her down.</color>
AK12()<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The rescue mission has ended in failure. AN-94 and I will bury Ange's body and self-destruct in 15 minutes.</color>

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:We are surprised you are still capable of such deception under these circumstances. +We have truly underestimated you, Griffin Commander. +We must administer a larger, but not fatal, dosage.

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Ange did not die, at least not in this battle. We saw her kill one of us with our very own eyes. +So tell us how she survived and with whom she has had dealings.
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:I will tell them everything that comes to mind. +The lies, the truth. Let them guess. +I know what they're really after. I also know the consequences of giving them what they want.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Humans are fragile contraptions that break down easily. +If you wish to leave this facility with your mind and body intact, value the chance you have been given and tell the truth.
()||:That's why I need time...as well as all sorts of fantasies to counter the truth serum. +How many more times will Miss Ange die in my story? +At the very least, she has to keep dying till I can live... +...
