NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||：Commander, there's an emergency!+Communication has been cut off from the detention center currently holding the AR Team. The situation is identical to the last Parapluie attack.+At the same time, a large number of Sangvis units have suddenly emerged within Area S05 and are moving to the detention center.+But we can't take the risk of storming the building at the moment, so we can only count on the defense system and our T-Dolls inside.+Your priority is to destroy the Sangvis troops on the outside to alleviate the pressure faced by those within the detention center.+Please mobilize as quickly as you can and try your best to stop the enemy from surging into the building!
