RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Commander, we're in the vicinity of Base 0.+We shall proceed to enter the base and set up a temporary camp for the search of File No. 7.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Let's talk about how we split the work, RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：I'll remain in command of the team as I establish the anti-jamming system and track down File No. 7 as well as Sangvis movement.+SOP-II will be on stand-by, alerting us immediately of enemies in close vicinity.+We can just leave those in the outlying area to the Commander's forces.+M16, you're to screen and revise your operation stratagems according to the situation and aid me in completing the mission.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||：Dear me... I guess competent people do get more work...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Miss Persica, is File No. 7 our sole objective for this mission?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：Well... The authorization is hard to come by, so I'd also want to keep an eye out for something else.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Apologies, Miss Persica...+But according to my calculations, investigating other matters beside File No. 7 will increase the risk of the mission exponentially.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：Ah...you're right.+Anyway, get moving. I'll give more directives when something comes up.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Understood. Then let's continue with the operation.
