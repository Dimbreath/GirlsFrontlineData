NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Tsk... +Fine. But just to make this clear, the price is not negotiable. We're making a living here, you know.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:As long as I have the file, name your price. +And...one more thing. I think you should know...

驾驶员()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Roger that. Holding and circling.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What is it?
驾驶员()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:It's strange. This route didn't have so much air traffic control before.
无线电()<Speaker>Radio Broadcast</Speaker>||:IOP helicopter, the airspace you're heading to is now a military control zone. All unauthorized aircrafts are barred entry. Please divert immediately.
驾驶员()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:Understood. Diverting.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:So we can't get there?

M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is the ground also in lockdown?
驾驶员()<Speaker>Pilot</Speaker>||:I'm not sure about that, but seeing that it's a military control zone, I'd say it doesn't make a difference whether you're on the ground or in the air.

M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...came on short notice and haven't had a chance to meet my commander yet.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>Human Soldier</Speaker>||:Then contact your master first, Miss Doll. +But I'd leave it if I were you. A scrawny Doll like you won't be of much use in there, especially with a weapon like that.
