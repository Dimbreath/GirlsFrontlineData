Alchemist()<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh? How long will you last with your antique rounds?+Now let me guess. Are you gonna get shredded along with your little friends, or keel over as you run away on your own?+Paint your face with the sweetest kind of fear and let me have a taste!
()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><BIN>2</BIN><SE1>Battlefield</SE1><黑屏2>:One hour into the operation. Squad Negev is surrounded by Sangvis troops and in dire situation.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Dammit... It's as if we've kicked a hornet's nest! They just keep swarming at us!+Since when were there so many Sangvis units in Area S08?!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:This is abnormal. Commanding this many units is far beyond the capability of a regular Ringleader.+Alchemist could just be a bait to lure us into this trap...
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Whatever the case, we're not gonna last long!+Negev, order us to fall back!+...Negev? Negev, do you copy?!
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||<黑屏1><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Negev's signal has vanished. She must've gone within the Parapluie jam.+She's out for blood. Looks like we're on our own again...+Commander, are you listening? We've temporarily lost contact with Negev so we need your help.+Please fend off these Sangvis interceptors and cover our retreat.
