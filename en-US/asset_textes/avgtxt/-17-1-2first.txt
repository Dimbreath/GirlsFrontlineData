()||<BIN>85</BIN>:...There is an encrypted personal communications request.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Oh? And at a time like this... +Good evening, Persica.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:What, is it nighttime already?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:How's M4? Did the neural upgrade go well?
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Not bad so far. There's nothing to worry about. +I should thank you on her behalf for providing the upgrade data.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:Would you mind letting me take a look? I don't mind if it's just peeping at her.
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Sorry, but they're already preparing for their next mission.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:You gave her a new mission again?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:I handed my precious Task Force DEFY to her, you know.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:You're not worried Mastermind's going to capture her?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Wouldn't that be better? Mastermind showing herself is a good opportunity for me. +But speaking of which, do you know why Mastermind is so eager to capture M4A1? +Right now, it looks like she considers that to be more important than even the survival of Sangvis Ferri itself.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:I've been looking into the matter myself, and I've got a few thoughts on the subject...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Such as?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:Lyco. +Do you still remember him?
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:I do. He developed Mastermind and he's arguably the man behind it all... At least, that's how it appears on the surface. +What does that dead man have to do with M4A1?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:You should know that we used to have a relationship. +When I was taking the brain scan of the biological model for M4, Lyco asked me for a copy as well. At that time he was developing his own AI framework.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:So as I understand it...you gave him M4's neural cloud model?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:That wasn't M4's neural cloud model yet. From an unscientific point of view, perhaps you could call it a "soul"...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:What...? +Still...that alone doesn't prove a direct relationship between both parties, and it certainly doesn't explain why the Military cares so much about Mastermind.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:Indeed, it makes no sense. I had some ideas about that earlier...but I need more clues to back them up.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Are you phrasing things this way on purpose?
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:I haven't forgotten about what I asked you for earlier.
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Sier will send it to you in five minutes. +Still, getting it was a lot harder than expected. You definitely owe me for this.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:That'll depend on the contents. Have you looked at them?
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Didn't have the time to. Besides, you'll tell me about them anyway. +Oh, and some good news, I found some encrypted data on a military theatre command server.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:What? Things went that well?
NPC-Persica(1);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:I'm guessing the Military got careless. +Want to know what's inside? Though I only peeked at a little bit.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:What are you willing to tell me?
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:A few lists of names concerning participants in OGAS. I'll send it over to you in a bit. +Besides, all this chaos is linked to the OGAS system, and that restless lot in the Military...
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:I can imagine. The OGAS Project was an infrastructural plan to build a nation-wide system from the previous century. +Still, it's very unsettling that the Military is so interested in a national-level management system like this.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Who knows? +And there's one more person, Persica, a certain person you know is on the list. I have a good offer for that answer.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:Who？
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:Your boss, Havier Witkin. He took part in a military operation in '32 involving OGAS and a Relic, along with that Carter guy. +He was present as part of the technical personnel, which means that he is very familiar with both of these things.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN>:... +So Mr. Havier was involved in this after all.
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>85</BIN>:I don't know what I should say, but I guess this is useful information?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>85</BIN><黑屏1>:Yes... +Very useful indeed... +The question is...what should I do now?
