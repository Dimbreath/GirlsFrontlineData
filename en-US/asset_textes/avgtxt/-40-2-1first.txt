()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1><BIN>162</BIN>:... +The last target has been shot down and peace is restored to the beach.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That was unexpected.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As I watch the Dolls inspecting the battlefield, I recall Kalina's promise of a peaceful holiday and feel a sense of déjà vu.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Woe is me, but at least it's over...
G41的声音()<Speaker>Gr G41's Voice</Speaker>||:Didn't see that coming, did you? I'm gonna show you what I've really got!
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:...I hope?
C-MS的声音()<Speaker>C-MS's Voice</Speaker>||:You dare challenge me? You've got guts, I'll give you that much at least. TAKE THAT!
G41的声音()<Speaker>Gr G41's Voice</Speaker>||:Ahahahahaha~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:We've picked a relatively clean section of the beach for our holiday spot, sandwiched in between two clusters of reefs that are easily taller than a person. The commotion seems to be coming from behind them.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Since this morning, the girls have been running around causing a ruckus like birds let out of their cages. +Everyone completely lets themselves loose, probably because it's a hard-earned vacation – they're so relaxed they didn't even notice the fight that just took place over there. +The splashing waves and the sound of merrymaking starkly contrast the tense atmosphere after the recent battle, creating the illusion of two entirely different worlds.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I remember they even brought toys for a water fight...?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Commander, all targets eliminated. That was some brilliant leadership, Commander!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Before I can reply, Serdyukov notices the Dolls who are still completely oblivious.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Look at those little sparrows chirping and having fun.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander. Their comms module seem to have been deactivated when the emergency hails were issued. Probably because they're playing in the water...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It did happen completely out of the blue, so this isn't exactly a case of dereliction of duty, but we must all remain vigilant while we learn more about our enemy. +Besides, it's not a good thing to lose one's head like that – they probably don't even remember today is Thursday.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Commander, it's Friday today.
SPS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hmm?
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Hmm? +Oh...!
SPS(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ahem... Scout the surroundings while I call them back.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Serdyukov tactfully catches up with her fellow Dolls and starts venturing deeper into the island. +I watch as they disappear into the distance and let out a sigh. Once I go around the reefs, I see the group of little sparrows gleefully fighting their own "war" on the beach.
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Heheheh, I'm gonna pay you back double!
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:O-only if you catch me~!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The two girls are locked in a chase with pure smiles on their faces, as if they lived in a world with no more strife...
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:I look around to make sure that neither SPAS-12 nor the Damascus steel axe is around and sigh in relief... +I'd better stop thinking about stupid things. I don't want to interrupt them, but this really isn't the time to fool around.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Alright, that's it for today. Assemble over there at once!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:... +Those two are still frolicking.
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:They haven't turned off their auditory module as well, have they?
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Oh, Commander! You're right on time! Come with me!
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;CBJMS(4)||:It's no use to hide! Commencing counterattack~!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;CBJMS(4)||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Counter what...? Hold on, why are you running towards me?!
G41(2)<Position>0,100</Position>;CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:As my subordinate, it's your job to sacrifice yourself! I'll remember you!
G41(2)<Position>0,100</Position>;CBJMS(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I didn't agree to being your meat shield...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Dammit! How dare you use Master like that? I won't forgive you! Take this!
G41(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Your "this" hit me square in the face! +Wait, what did you put in the water pistol?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr G41 and C-MS are so into pushing me around it's practically impossible to reason with them, and I suddenly find myself yanked over to the water.
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Commander? I didn't expect you to enjoy such childish games. I guess I'll have to lower my expectations.
FAL(4)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Says you, who's holding a water gun yourself? +Listen here, things aren't looking good on that side of the beach. I need you to...
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:Ahahahahaha!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Please...let me finish!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I've never seen the Commander so lively.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>I must document this for future reference! Show me more! More!</color> +I-I'm coming too!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_splash_water</SE1>:For whatever reason, I seem to have become everyone's target. +Waves and jets of water splash everywhere and have me completely disoriented. +As the attack subsides a little, I finally manage to catch a glimpse of the beach, but I also see a small object flying straight at me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Smack! +This thing hits me on the forehead like a bullet. Its strong momentum actually knocks me off-balance and I topple backwards.
Ameli(5)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>||:Oh no! Where did my button go?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_fall_into_water</SE1>:Oh boy. +Before I can even utter this, I'm completely submerged in the cold seawater. +The currents swirl around me and drag my body into the deep. +As I'm still struggling to find my equilibrium, I feel the back of my head hitting something hard, then I lose consciousness...
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Commander, we've finished searching the perimeters. Are you still not ready? +...Where's the Commander?
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;SPS(2)||:Huh? You're right, Master is gone! The Commander was here just a second ago!
G41(2)<Position>0,100</Position>;CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>||:Must be hiding!
G41(2)<Position>0,100</Position>;4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Huh? Does the Commander know how to swim?
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;4type(2)||:That doesn't matter because the problem is pretty obvious, don't you think? +The Commander is drowning!
G41(2)<Speaker>Gr G41</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;4type(2)||:Drowning?! +O-oh no! Master, I'm coming to save you!
CBJMS(4)<Speaker>C-MS</Speaker>;4type(2)||:I can't let anything happen to my precious subordinate!
4type(2)<Speaker>4 Shiki</Speaker>||:Hold on, the waves are getting too strong!
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Don't panic and don't rush it! We must keep calm right now!</color> +Hailing all Dolls. Hailing all Dolls! +The Commander is in danger! Please rally at my location!
Ameli(5)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker><Position>0,100</Position>;SPS(2)||:Oh, they're coming!
Ameli(5)<Position>0,100</Position>;SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:So soon? No, those are enemy units!
FAL(4)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;SPS(2)||:At a time like this? What awful timing.
FAL(4);SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:We didn't pick up any signals in our recent search though... Anyway, we need to put together a counterattack right away!
SPS(2)<Speaker>Serdyukov</Speaker>||:Our reinforcements are going to arrive soon! Let's eliminate the immediate threat in the meantime!
