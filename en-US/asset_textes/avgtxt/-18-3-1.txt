NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:M4, do you read me?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Loud and clear.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I believe you understand that we're in treacherous waters. +Just destroying Sangvis Ferri will not be enough to stop the Military. +We need to know more, understand more.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Hmm.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So I'll give it to you straight. I already know you're going to meet Mastermind. +I'm guessing she traded you the location of the missing SOP-II and M16.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:...
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:But in truth, you don't actually have much hope of finding them, so you're prepared to take her with you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:They've been gone too long... Are you going to stop me?
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:There's a saying, "Our eyes are our prison, and all we see are the walls of our gaol." +Don't be bound by what you know, and don't let a blind thirst for revenge lead you astray.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:So what?! So I shouldn't do anything at all?! Just obey your orders?! +You promised me you'd let me find my friends! Well?!
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:And if they're no longer around?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:...If they're no longer around, then everyone who hurt them will pay!
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:So if you want revenge, on whom will you exact your vengeance? +Are you planning to kill every Sangvis unit? Kill Captain Yegor? Then what?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:There's no "then". +I can't just do nothing... I can't go back to being my old self...the weak and cowardly M4A1...
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Cowardice may be shameful, but it is not fatal. +Courage may be awe-inspiring, but it will lead you into the abyss.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Then...what should I do...? +I don't want to keep being protected by everyone, nor do I want others to sacrifice themselves for me. If I had the choice, I wouldn't even want to be M4A1!
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:You still have a choice. +Choose not to die with Mastermind, even if your teammates are no longer around.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:... +You want to capture her. You want ME to capture her.
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This is our last chance. Our last chance to keep more people from getting hurt. +Meet her. Buy time.Then the others will find a way to seize her. +Do you accept this request?
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:And if I fail?
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Then I will activate the last resort. There will be nothing left.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<黑屏1>:Then...it makes no difference to me.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>98</BIN><黑屏2>:It's about time. +M4, can you see the airdrop location? +And how are things on 404's end?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4?
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ah...sorry... I haven't seen any airdrop.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:How about 404?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...I wasn't synced with them just now.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...What's with you...? +Don't tell me you're starting to get cold feet at a time like this.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No... I'm just... +...It's a message from 404. +They've found the drop site.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2>:This mission's gone on for way too long... My limbs are about to fall off...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ahahaha, well, we need to train you from time to time, Gr G11~
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't want to train... I want to stay at home forever...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hang in there a little~ Who knows, we might never need to go on a mission again after this~♪
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hearing that from you gives me chills...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't sweat the small stuff. How are our surroundings?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do you think M4 really doesn't know where M16 is?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is that your patrol report?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I don't think she'd vanish just like that.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:If you're so concerned about her, then why not leave 404 and join me in looking for her?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:So you're already here. +How about it, 416? Sound like a good idea to you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Tsk. Gr G11, keep watching the perimeter with me.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Why do I have to go too...?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It seems the main cast is all here, so let's see what this airdrop package contains.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>133</BIN><黑屏2>:A strange...container? +Could it be a warhead?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like some sort of cannister. There are five of these... +I don't know where Ange got them from, but it's clear that a single one of these glass shells is scarier than all of Sangvis Ferri put together.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Are they so dangerous? They look pretty unassuming to me...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looks like this is going to be the biggest surprise we can give the Military. +AR-15, it's time for you to shine. I'll leave the connection and installation of the explosives to you. ♪
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Bitch, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well, you're the record holder for explosions among us. Didn't you load up with those things when you set out, as always? +I don't want to die for nothing because of a little mistake during the preparation, which is why I'm leaving it to you.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>71</BIN><黑屏2>:AR-15.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...Understood.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I have eight blocks of C-type TNT which can be detonated by remote control. I also have smoke flares and thermite strips for controlled demolition. +What do you plan to do with them?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Frankly speaking, I'm not too sure either. Why not ask Ange? +Ange, can you hear me? We found your package.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:Is that so? That was sooner than I expected. +Is everyone there?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:We're all gathered, just waiting for your next order.
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Alright. This means we can move on to the next stage.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Before you send us to our deaths, would you mind telling us what these things contain?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Let me see... +From the image, I'm guessing that they're sealed radial polarizers.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:So what's inside them?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:I can tell it's Collapse Fluid. I can't believe that old man actually dared drop this stuff from the air... And five cannisters too. +Still, each cannister doesn't seem to contain much...which means the contaminated zone won't be too large either...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Isn't this the stuff that triggered the previous world war?
UMP9(2);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:To think we'd have a Doll who actually read up on her history. That deserves praise.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:Hehehhe...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:By putting the Collapse Fluid together with the remote controlled explosives, I take it you want to make dirty bombs? +This stuff is going to affect humans a lot more than Dolls when it goes off, right?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Collapse Radiation. Dolls were initially developed because humans couldn't enter contaminated zones filled with radiation. That's part of history class too.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:So we're not the only ones who're going to die.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:This may sound weird coming from me, but I'm the one who's most likely to die. After all, death is a distant concept for Dolls.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:A distant concept, huh... +I can't just agree with that.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:That's true. After all, you've gone through different things than ordinary Dolls. +Alright, enough chit-chat. I've sent the coordinates where I want them to be planted. Once they're in place, get as far away from them as possible. +Dolls aren't easily affected by Collapse Radiation, but the explosion generates extreme temperatures that can melt even military armor plating.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:The ideal weapon for dealing with the Military and Sangvis Ferri.
AR15Mod(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Yes, but I would like all of us to get out of the blast radius before using it.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||:But I suppose we can evacuate only if we have Mastermind with us?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:We either capture her or blow everyone to kingdom come.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, you heard her. Y'all know what to do?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Pairing up will make it quicker. I'll handle two cannisters.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No problem. 9 will be with me and 416 will be with Gr G11. Alright, get to work~
