()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>260</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_xGS2_27</BGM>:Back in the garden. +We've left Angelica's Vita and returned to the garden in the blink of an eye. +Henrietta has re-materialized next to me, with two girls sleeping soundly using her lap as a pillow. She strokes their heads gently. +The sun is holding off the night with its final blaze and turning the clouds a fiery red, but it is still gradually giving in to the descending darkness.
Henrietta(2)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I see that both Angelica and Cano are sleeping nicely. +I most certainly didn't expect Angelica's story to end like that.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Were you surprised?
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yeah... Very much so. +A Cyborg should never forget about her Handler. To me, it's akin to an act of betrayal.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But...what if that's the ending that her Handler wanted for her?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:You mean Signore Marco wished Angelica would forget him?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:In that Vita, I could sense the Handler's guilt and regret, as well as the feelings he had for Angelica. +"Instead of sacrificing herself for me as a Cyborg, she'd be better off forgetting everything and living happily ever after." +That's the gist of it...
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Is that...how Signore Marco feels? +I would never be able to accept that.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The sentimental attachment you have to your Handler is a result of your Cyborg Conditioning... +There's no need for you to sacrifice yourselves over these artificial emotions.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:That's not true! +My feelings for you have nothing to do with my Conditioning! If even you think I should forget you, I'd rather...
()||:Henrietta jumps to her feet in great agitation, then immediately realizes her indiscretion and sits back down sheepishly.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I'm so sorry, Signore Giuseppe. I promised everyone I wouldn't let my emotions get the better of me... +But...I still hope if I ever end up in that situation, you will do whatever it takes to make me remember. +I don't want to forget everything I've done with you just like that, Signore Giuseppe.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Uh...right.
()||:Henrietta's abrupt movement has jolted Cano and Angelica awake. +The two girls sit up groggily and look around in confusion.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Huh...? Where am I...? Is that you, Commander?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Cano seems to have returned to normal. We should talk on an encrypted channel. It'd be bad if those children overhear things that they shouldn't know.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's what Kalina said.</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright... But that's a strange request.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Have your memories returned? Do you still remember me?</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What an odd thing to ask. Aren't you the Commander?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Oof... My head feels really woozy, as if I just had a very long dream.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do Dolls also dream...?</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I think you were there in the dream!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Oh right, where are Ceno and the others?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Answer me first. How did you get in here?</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>S.A.T.8 found a really interesting place on Level II, so we came in for a stroll while enjoying our pizza.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The next thing I knew, you're standing right in front of me.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Our Dolls seem to have gotten lost in the stories of this place. Their neural clouds are being used to simulate stories that belong to some other characters.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That's why they're trapped here until their stories draw to a close.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So the only way to get them out safely is to play through all the stories?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That would certainly be the most benign way of doing it... The girls in this space don't seem to be hostile, so we should solve the problem without hurting them if possible.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I think you're just curious about the stories...</color>
NPC-Kalin(5)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ha...haha... I mean, they ARE interesting.</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So what should I do now?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It looks pretty safe in the garden. You should be able to come back to base anytime, Cano.</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hmm...I think I'll wait for the others here. If I leave without Ceno, she'll kick up a massive fuss.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Is it okay for her to stay here?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It should be fine as long as she doesn't run off. The garden doesn't have any authorization restrictions.</color>
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Even Miss Kalin says so. Besides, I can't stop thinking about that girl with the long hair. I have a strange feeling that I've met her before.</color>
()||:I turn around and see Henrietta chatting with Angelica. Angelica asks her when the Handlers are coming back. Henrietta shakes her head in response and Angelica looks disappointed.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:My body is mostly recovered. I wish Signore Marco could see me soon so he'd bring me along on missions again.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I'm sure he'll be back shortly. After all, Signore Giuseppe is here.
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Uh...um, my name is Carcano. Mind if I join you?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:Oh...s-sure. Are you a new Cyborg?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:Hmm? Cyborg? I guess so?
Angelica(0)<Speaker>Angelica</Speaker>||:You seem kind of familiar...
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Carcano M1891</Speaker>||:What a coincidence! I feel exactly the same about you! +Uh, listen... Do you know the story of the Prince of Pasta?
()||:Cano and Angelica strike up a conversation naturally as if they've known each other for a long time. +Henrietta takes my hand and drags me away from them quietly.
Henrietta(2)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe, let's sit here for a while.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sure.
()||:Henrietta and I sit down on a bench on the other side of the garden. The sun has almost set completely; only a stroke of salmon pink lingers above the horizon. +Henrietta keeps changing the way she clasps her hands, as if still bothered by what happened just now.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Something's on your mind.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Signore Giuseppe... +But I still can't fathom why you didn't tell Angelica the truth. Even if you aren't the real Signore Marco, surely you can still understand the bond between a Cyborg and her Handler?
()||:I think back on the days I've spent with my Dolls. We are fortunate to have discovered neural cloud technology. If my Dolls were destroyed in battle and ended up forgetting everything afterwards, I would be devastated. +If I could help it, I'd also do whatever I can to keep my Dolls from dangerous fights. If one weren't compelled by the circumstances, who would willingly watch everything they cherish crumble to dust?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry if I was being presumptuous.
Henrietta(2)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I understand how you feel, Signore Giuseppe. After all, you've always been kind-hearted... +An ordinary girl would be happy to live an ordinary life.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You are all ordinary girls to me.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:But we aren't. Can ordinary girls kill with no remorse? +We are not ordinary girls – we are Cyborgs, and Cyborgs have our own way of life. +That's why to us, severing our bond with our Fratello is more painful than death. +If I were just an ordinary girl, I wouldn't be able to do anything. If I want to be of any use to you, Signore Giuseppe, then I cannot afford to be an ordinary girl!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Not an ordinary girl...? It's hard to agree with her when she said that looking so innocent...but I can't bring myself to argue with her.</color> +I'm sorry, I understand the full extent of your resolve as a Cyborg. +Let's make our way to the next Vita. The other girls are probably waiting for us.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:...Do we have to go now?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I must get my new friends out. There are important missions waiting for them.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:But it's very safe in Vita; maybe they could come out by themselves. Why do you have to trouble yourself with this task, Signore Giuseppe?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:It's my mission.
Henrietta(2)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:...I see. +Then let's go to Rico's next. Her Vita is also quite easy to find. It's just behind the second window to the left of the door.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, then let's go.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Okay... +Um... Before we set off, could you please stay with me for just a little longer? +Think of it as my reward for staying with you in Angelica's Vita.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Fine, if that's what you want. +What would you like me to do?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Heheh... +You don't have to do anything, Signore Giuseppe. Just sit with me.
()||:Henrietta shuffles a bit closer to me inconspicuously and looks up at the now completely dark sky. +I follow her gaze. The distant stars are already shining faintly, twinkling as they're occasionally obscured by the drifting clouds.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:The stars are beautiful as always.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Do you like the stars?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yes. Have you forgotten? The first time I went stargazing was with you on the rooftop. +People came up with stories for the stars, and I came to understand how kind you actually are as you told me those stories. +Whenever I see the stars, I'm reminded of all the legends and myths that you've shared with me, Signore Giuseppe.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that so...?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:That's why I want to help Signore Giuseppe no matter what... +I don't want to forget anything about Signore Giuseppe...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Giu...I won't forget you either.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:(Giggles)
()||:We speak no more and simply watch the night sky in silence amidst the fragrant flowers and chirping critters. +A few fireflies hover before me. I stretch out towards the faint glowing orbs , but they're beyond my reach despite their apparent proximity. +Henrietta is now leaning against my shoulder, breathing evenly. I noticed she had looked a bit tired before, and now she's fast asleep. +Just how long has she been waiting? If I hadn't entered this space, how long was she going to keep waiting? +And where has her Handler gone, or has he already forgotten about her? +I recall how long it has been since the last login record – she has undoubtedly been left behind by the world in which she had belonged. +The thought makes me melancholic. Perhaps time will inevitably erase all traces of our existence – both hers and mine. +And perhaps that is why she was so upset.
()||<黑屏1>:Perhaps the final wish of these girls is to never be forgotten.
