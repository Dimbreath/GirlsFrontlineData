M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4A1, the structure of Architect's command post has been thoroughly mapped out. +But SAA still needs some time to set things up.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I know. I'll buy time for her. +We may be outnumbered, but we have ample supplies and can keep this going for a long time. +Tell them not to rush and remain vigilant at all times!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Can we though? Judging by Architect's character, she probably won't put up with our harassment for long...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm not too sure about that. Architect...seems a bit different than how she comes off in our data. +I also need some time to feel out the way she acts and come up with corresponding tactics. +Perhaps then...we can deal with them all - Architect...as well as the Sangvis AI core.
