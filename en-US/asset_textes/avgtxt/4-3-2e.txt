M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:This...is the third recording.+Then, I shall play it...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:Audio starts playing...+'They...are...'+'...in the skies...'+...End of recording.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:'They are...in the skies'? +What on earth does that mean?
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Nothing. Just some random verse.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:Can't believe you guys are actually studying them so seriously.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:AR-15, you are here.
M4A1(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Just wanna see what we're risking our lives for.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:This operation is issued and directed by none other than the commander. We should not have any objections.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I don't have any objections whatsoever, but if all we get in the end are these mystifying recordings...it'll be a waste of effort.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:There is still one last recording left. Once we have it, everything will be clear.
M4A1(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Better be careful, M4A1. As you know, our neural clouds can't be backed up to Griffin's server.+If we're destroyed, we'll... (shrugs)
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:Rest assured. Now that we are all finally reunited, I will not lose a single one of you again.
M4A1(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph. Getting confident, aren't we, M4A1? You'd have started doubting yourself if it was before.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:This is because...our last separation made me realize what it is like to lose you.+I do not know if I have indeed become more confident, but I must fulfil my responsibilities in order to avoid making the same mistakes again.
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's good, but don't push yourself too hard.+For us T-Dolls, the worst nightmare isn't death, but disappointment.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:AR-15...+Have you actually experienced...'death'...?
M4A1(2);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+What meaning is there...to an T-Doll's 'death'?+If these recordings are really left behind by a T-Doll, does her feelings matter all that much, compared to the truth?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:AR-15... We are already very lucky to have the commander take us in and care for us. It is like...having a home.
M4A1(0);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Sorry, Commander. I didn't mean to bring this up...+But we're just a bunch of AIs. Tools made for fighting. That's all we are.+Now let's finish our mission, M4A1.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:Okay. Miss Kalina has sent us the coordinates. I am going to confirm the location...
M4A1(0);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Hold on.
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:These coordinates...+Can it be...that place from before?
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:Before?
M4A1(2);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Where we ran into Agent in Area S09.
