()||<BIN>55</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Nighttime, territory under Sangvis control in Area S15.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Here we are. +Well, do you like it?
UMP45(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tell me more about this place. Maybe I'll come to like it more.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:There's not much to be said. You know all about the contamination zone. +Beilan Island, collapse fluid, WWIII, then...this.
UMP45(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Euroky Low-Emission Infectious Disease (E.L.I.D.)...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Don't worry. The radiation index isn't too high here. +We'll also be doing most of the search in cyberspace so we'll keep out of the most dangerous areas. Follow me.
UMP45(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Will we come across zombies?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Well...let's hope not.
UMP45(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:WHAT?! So there ARE zombies?!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Nein, at least not here. It's not like we're in a movie or a game. +So you're scared of this kind of thing, 9?
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ugh...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:So that's why you always say you have some errands to run every time I watch "The Flying Dead".
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Sighs) I guess... +Now that you mention it, Gr G11, that is one hell of a long show. You must've watched over 20 seasons...
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:26 seasons, then WWIII happened and it just stopped like that. +I was actually really looking forward to the Underwater Zombie King that can do the German suplex in episode 9. He got injected with Virus Ж plus an extra 3L of T-rex embryo in the easter egg after the credit. +Damn I just love biopunk. Love it...
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't really get it...but you sure love this sort of stuff...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:That's because the only difference between this piece of junk and a zombie is the fact that she does utter something intelligible every now and then. +The kind of thing you watch always puts me to sleep. "Humans are the ultimate enemy" is such a cliché. +I believe the sense of horror brought solely by biting and tearing and gore is the true essence of zombie films.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:I don't disagree, but that kind of movie is pretty much extinct, right? +Besides, it's not like we haven't experienced an actual zombie apocalypse...
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ugh...I've had enough of this conversation. Let's focus on the mission instead... +Are we there yet, 45?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:...
UMP45(2);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45? Say something!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:...Huh? +Oh... We...we're almost there. +Ja, that base just ahead. Let's go.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:... +Don't you think...45 has been a bit strange lately?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:You mean...how her reaction sometimes comes a bit slow?
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:The brain can be the first thing to turn in a zombie...
G11(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hey, that conversation is over! +(Sighs) Maybe we should keep an eye on her condition and report it to Sier when it becomes necessary...
()||<黑屏2>:Fifteen minutes later.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We've taken care of the prep work. What now?
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now...we search for a suitable surveillance base to organize our search for the drone.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Is this a tongue twister or something...
G11(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:The mission itself is pretty simple, right? +I'm gonna connect to the network and direct an echelon to figure out an infiltration route. +You guys wait here. I'll give the green light when I'm ready.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<黑屏1>:Sure, 45. We'll wait for your signal.
