()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:...Sometime earlier... +Within the ruins of the Earth Computer.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Everyone, look closely! What you're about to see is the final miracle of human civilization— +The— Earth— Computer—
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏2>:...Or rather, its remains. Yes yes, I know, those words of yours woke me up. +Come with me, I know where the tunnel is.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:So, how does it feel to revisit your tracks in the same day, shorty?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I don't know... I've experienced so many bizarre things in one day that this is instead the most nostalgic part of it.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You seem down.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I only just regained my memories! My neural cloud's still trying to categorize which memories are the precious ones that I lost and got back, and which ones are just bad luck on my part after meeting you today!
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Are you bothered by your memories of the past?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Dana(0)||<BGM>m_va_where_do_i_go_from_here_</BGM>:
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:How do you manage to see through me... +Think about all the things I did, like abandoning my partner and sleeping in a pile of S.F. carcasses for three years. +There should have been a better way. If only I had been more reliable...
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You've already done very well, shorty. It was cooler than the coolest thing I did.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:No, it's all because of IDW... +Dana, do you know why it's raining sand?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Let me sort out the facts... +First, the Earth Computer was going to destroy the world. In order to stop Elisa, who was going to carry out that plan, IDW substituted herself as the computer's AI core.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Dana and Super-Shorty sift through the electronic debris, enter an access code which opens an access hatch, and then jump in.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:And then, the Computer used IDW's neural cloud to reformulate its plan to destroy the world. +And...the plan to destroy the world changed to drowning the world in sand. +And so...yeah, why sand rains, anyway?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Because of cats.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Cats?
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:IDW's original design included feline characteristics. +That's why her appearance included cat ears and a tail, and her personality was probably referenced from the noisier kinds of cats. +Perhaps it was because she was an early product of IOP, or perhaps she was made to be a friend for someone who liked kitty ears...or something like that.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:Cats? Then Jill would have liked her, but what do cats have to do with sand— +Ah, wait... +So the stuff that's falling from the sky isn't real sand...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Yes, it's not sand. +It's kitty litter.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:...It's the most direct solution a cat would use to deal with a pile of shit. +Hah...I have to say, it's certainly a little weird...
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hehe, it's not often that you say that...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Super-Shorty and Dana pass through a cavern filled with wires.
()<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Because IDW's processing speed was too slow, the efficiency of the plan went down. +Therefore, the Computer's plan to destroy the world was greatly delayed.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:Er...which means, if it was a smarter cat-eared Doll in there instead, we would probably have been buried by several trillion tons of sand over the course of a single night?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:(Bitter smile) Yes, we were all saved by an idiot...
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Shorty, you and IDW did your best. The danger was caused by that Anna person. +If she hadn't snatched Alma, the matter could have been solved three years ago. You couldn't have thought of this.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:You say that, but...can we really beat that Anna? She seems to be omnipresent and omnipotent.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Are you getting cold feet, shorty? I heard Alma say you used to be a real firecracker.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I-I'm not! +I'm not as mature as Jericho, and I'm not as carefree as IDW. My personality...is terrible. +Back in Griffin City, I was always seen as an insignificant little shorty. I worked my hardest to try and shed that view of me. I wanted to be acknowledged and liked by everyone.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Super-Shorty and Dana climb down a narrow passage.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN>:When Alma gave me this mission three years ago, I was very happy. I thought that everyone had finally approved of me, until Alma said that IDW was my partner... +That was when I knew that I had not been chosen because I was important, but simply because I was a midget. The characteristic about me that I most hated became the reason I had been chosen for such a glorious task. + I couldn't accept that, and I kept cursing at everyone around me. I told IDW that someone like her would only hold me back and other hateful and unpleasant things. +In truth, I was really talking about myself. I had simply projected my resentment and hatred onto her.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Super-Shorty's voice starts to grow depressed.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:I don't understand. Why didn't she hate me? Why did she go so far as to wish me goodnight with a smile? +I didn't do a single good thing for her. I even forgot her. I'm a total and utter bastard.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Hey, shorty. +You may have done a few things wrong, and you may have hurt your partner. +But you owe her, not yourself. If anyone should be calling you a bastard, then it should be her, and not you.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I...just...
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You're just thinking of hurting yourself to make yourself feel better, but all that's going to do is distance you further from her to avoid what she really thinks of you. +What you need to do now is bravely face her and let her decide whether or not you are a bastard. +Until then, don't put yourself down for no good reason. Give her the chance to do that, okay?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I don't know if I'll be able to see her. It's been three years. +Could her neural cloud have endured operating the Earth Computer for that long?
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:That's why we're doing this now. +We're going to find that IDW, and let her curse you out or beat the crap out of you, and then we're going to save the world.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:Hah, and you said you didn't care about this sort of thing before.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I'm certainly not too worried about the crisis now. I can live with the sand rains or S.F. in my own way. +If you wanted me to put on a suit and deal with inflation and income tax problems, I'd tell you to sit on it and twirl. +The reason why I'm still living in modern society is purely because I like spicy fried chicken and that I don't have to invent the electric lightbulb by myself. +But saving the world? How could I miss out on something as cool as that?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:I don't think saving the world is that simple, but that's alright. At the very least, I won't let my mind waver anymore. Let's start by finding the Earth Computer.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:You really hid the Computer in a strange place. If Earth hadn't stopped spinning, I don't even know how we'd have come to the core.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>;Dana(0)||:It's because there's no electronic signals here and I hid it in a place where the Elevator couldn't reach, so even Anna couldn't have found it. +However, finding it is a little troublesome. This route is way too roundabout; even I don't know how much further we have to go.
SuperShorty(0);Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:But...I have the feeling we're almost there!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1>:Why— Ah!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Dana grabs Super-Shorty as a laser beam streaks past Super-Shorty's head!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Because there's S.F. here!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Look for cover! They're defense units for the Earth Computer! +We've been found. We won't be able to get past them with just the two of us!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Now this is quite a pickle, but could I do this myself...? +No, I guess it would be pretty hard to take them all out.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Are you seriously considering to fight them all by yourself!?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Honestly, they're really dragging their feet, aren't they? +Jericho! Walk any slower and you'll miss a performance that rivals my highlights from the Grand Slam!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:...Bangbang!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:I don't care about your highlights. They clogged up the TV channels for an entire year. +You owe me one now, Dana.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Unlike you, I don't keep track of how many times I've saved you.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:About three, maybe four times? Couldn't be more than that?
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Jericho!? Are you Jack, the legendary hero of White Knights' Blitzkrieg Corps!?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:You're Dana's little follower, aren't you? I heard you got your memories back. Congratulations.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Wait, why do you look so ordinary...
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:That's because Alma fixed me up. You can thank that hacker and 16Lab's quick repair technology.
()<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:And me! I was the one that contacted Alma!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:No, Jack, I'm asking where's your transforming uniform? And your transforming hero buddies!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:No, I'm not this Jack or whoever.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Yes you are, I remember that voice!
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:That's not important. Anyway, I've brought all my Doll subordinates who are still willing to follow me. Shall we get to work, Dana?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:There sure are a lot of Dolls who are willing to follow you.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Yet, there aren't many people like you.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I told you, I don't like using guns.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:Then you can regret that choice of yours, because now it's time for us to shine—+ ...There's a bit too many S.F. here, shall we wipe them all out?
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Has your heart gotten soft?
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:I've been chasing S.F. for so many years, and that damn Architect just played me like a fiddle. All I want to do now is thoroughly exterminate every last Sangvis Ferri there is, and you're asking if I've gotten soft? +But we'll need a bit of time. We're in a confined space, and our numbers are limited, after all.
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:We don't even have the time to spare for that. We need to get to the Computer ASAP and have IDW bring down the firewall!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:Then let's get a move on. Jericho, cover us.
Jericho(0)<Speaker>Jericho</Speaker>||:Don't run too far ahead. Our bullets won't reach that far.
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||:I'll try. Stay focused, shorty! Time for a workout!
SuperShorty(0)<Speaker>Super-Shorty</Speaker>||:Hmph, this is exactly what I need. I'm just itching to kill something right now!
Dana(0)<Speaker>Dana</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Looks like you've found the right target for your frustration. +Come, let's get through this place ASAP and find the Earth Computer!
