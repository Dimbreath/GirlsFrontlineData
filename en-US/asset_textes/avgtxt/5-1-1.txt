NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Welcome, Commander.+I believe this is the first time we meet in person. Glad to see you're punctual.+...Actually, you've come a bit too early. Mr. Kryuger is still attending to some other business.+Now let me fill you in on why we've called you in this time.+Persica has pieced together a few keywords from the intel acquired from Safe House 3 by the AR Team.+At this stage, we can safely assume that Sangvis Ferri is plotting to initiate an unknown plan codenamed 'Parapluie'.+No matter how this plan is implemented, it will undoubtedly pose an immense threat to Griffin.+Which is why Mr. Kryuger has decided to call an emergency meeting here at our secret base to discuss countermeasures with several field commanders.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:Commander, this base isn't very far from your control center so you can continue to manage your troops here.+You may participate in an operation drill while we wait for Mr. Kryuger and the others to assemble.+Test the current efficiency of our T-Dolls and update the HQ database.
