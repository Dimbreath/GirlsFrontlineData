 ()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><Night><BIN>1</BIN>:Objective accomplished. FAL has rendezvoused with all members of Team FF.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You two are late.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:A-Apologies, Mademoiselle FAL! This place is swarming with enemy units so we spent a lot of time making detours...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:You should've set the rendezvous point closer to them, 57.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:They said they were okay with it. There was no reason to question them.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:I'm sorry... We thought we could make it in time. Turns out we were stretching it a bit...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Don't force it if you know you can't do something. You should be more aware of your own shortcomings.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Don't be too hard on them. Just pay more attention next time, FF FN49. +Now, give us your scouting report.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Sure... The information is with FF FNC. FF FNC? +Stop eating and start talking!
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Mnghggng...! Okay I'm done! +So...we've had it all figured out! +The local Sangvis Ringleader is indeed Alchemist, and we've ascertained that she's the one behind the missing T-Dolls.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Alchemist? I didn't expect her to still be here... +This area should hold no strategic value to Sangvis Ferri anymore, so why...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter why she's here. Let's come up with a plan for now.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Huh? Is this the team? Just the four of us?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:The other two members of Team FF are away on another mission, so we'll be having fun here on our own.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||:Merci. We're honored to be given this opportunity. We'll definitely do our best!
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:I don't care if you do your best. Just do as I say.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:At least give them some sort of encouragement, FAL. They're newbies after all...
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:FF FNC, FF FN49, I chose you to join this operation for one simple reason. +Your Imprints are similar to ours so it'll make coordination more efficient. That's it. +You may only be temps, but if you perform well, you'll be rewarded handsomely.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||:Oooooooh!!! We're gonna hit it big this time!
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Maybe. Let me take a look at the map... +The abandoned base is the most prominent structure in the area, isn't it?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:Oui, according to intel, that's also where AR-15 abducted M4A1.
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Heheh...then that's our landmark right there. +The base can be divided into two sections - perfect for two people. It's settled then.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:You're grinning ominously... What evil plan are you hatching this time, FAL?
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:If we're to capture Alchemist, what is the first thing that needs to be done?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:Finding her, bien sûr.
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:And luckily for us, she'll take the initiative provided that...?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||:...There is prey worth her effort.
FN57(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:So the most efficient plan is...?
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...To bait her.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ah... I understand... (Gazes at FF FN49 and FF FNC)
FNFNC()<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:Hmm? ...Quoi?
FN49()<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? Don't tell me... +Whaaaaat??!!
