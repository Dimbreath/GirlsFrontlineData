NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So you really decided to sneak away, vile rats!</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Artillery force, fire at the target area! </color> +<color=#00CCFF>All other units, block all the exits! Kill everything on sight!</color>
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:We're busted. The military is on our tail!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They're not pursuing us. They're trying to blow us to pieces with artillery fire!
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Isn't that worse?!
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We have you completely surrounded! You'll either die from the artillery fire or my own bullets!</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Run! Don't look back!
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:94, don't drop Ange! We'll cover you!
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Which way should we move, Ange? +...Ange? Hey, Ange!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ange passed out! We must get out of here ASAP!
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Shut up, RO! You're slowing down my reaction speed!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I'm scanning the terrain! That's more important than whatever you're doing! +Yegor is bluffing - the military hasn't completely surrounded this area. There is an opening right ahead of us! +Run to the cover over there and head east, 4 o'clock! Don't let the enemies intercept you!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Follow RO's direction! We're making a run for it!
()||<黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Ten minutes later.
NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Sir, Ange's party slipped through the encirclement.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:I saw that five minutes ago. You got outrun by a few Dolls?
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:Our pursuit was less efficient than we expected. Their HOCs kept disrupting our attempts.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||:Their firepower doesn't pose much threat to us. Send out the high-mobility units first and confirm their whereabouts. Is the drone still not ready?
NPC-YegorDamage(0);NPC-Yegor(3)<Speaker>Military Corporal</Speaker>||:It's still being repaired. We can only scan for their signals at the moment, but have no way of confirming visuals. However, their movements are still clearly traceable with our surveillance. +And sir, there is an abandoned structure in the direction Ange's party is headed toward. They are very likely to seek refuge in there.
NPC-YegorDamage(0)<Speaker>Yegor</Speaker>;NPC-Yegor(3)||<黑屏1>:We're in the heart of the battlefield; they have no hope of getting help. Capturing them is only a matter of time! +They'll be digging their own graves when they walk inside that building. I will savor her despair and kill her with my own hands!
()||<黑屏2>:...Meanwhile, the rescue party is on the run.
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:AK-12, I see an abandoned building just ahead. With a thick exterior wall, the radiation should be lower inside. +We can take refuge in there to treat Ange and contact the Commander.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:The military will find us and have us surrounded.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Or...just demolish the building with their tanks...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Their tanks won't get here so soon. I'm guessing only their mechanical units or human soldiers will enter the building. +And you heard Yegor - he wants to seek revenge against Ange himself. +So should we all head inside and set up our defenses?
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That will be more secure, but having all our signals in one place will make us too conspicuous. +If only AK-12 and I are in the building, we can hoodwink their scans by camouflaging our signals.
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:416 and I can only disguise ourselves as Sangvis signals, which is basically useless against the Military.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:If we do that, we'll have to split up. You can figure out a way to draw the military away so that we have more time to wake Ange up. +But even for me...this is a bit too risky...
SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The military may be able to detect Ange's biological signs. If they do enter the building, you three will be in grave danger!
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:But even if we all engage the military right here in the building, the odds are still against us.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:AK-12, you're the leader now. You decide. +Do we all go in, or do just the two of you stay with Ange while the rest of us draw the enemies away? +We're about to reach the building, so make up your mind soon!
