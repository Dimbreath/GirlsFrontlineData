UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This layer is becoming turbulent. This doesn't look good...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_hope</BGM>:45, is this the last memory fragment?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja...you should be able to find M4 after passing through this memory. +I'll gather as much data as possible before the connection breaks. You're the only one who can bring M4 back, so go now.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(I just need to break through this final wall!)

AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<size=50>Wake up this instant! M4A1!!!</size>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<白屏1>:...! +(That's right, I was just in the connection...)
()||<白屏2><BIN>201</BIN>:M4A1's eyes snap open. +She tries to shove the Isomers around her away and crawl towards ST AR-15's voice with all her strength.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:AR-15! +I'm here!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know! I'm gonna get you out now!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:ST AR-15 rains bullets on the girls swarming in her direction as she makes for M4.
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15, you've come for me!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I promised, didn't I, that I would drag you back kicking and screaming?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I think they consumed OGAS!
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Who cares about that piece of crap?!
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:...Hnng!
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A violent whirlwind suddenly whisks past, forcing ST AR-15 to stay down where she is. +By the time she lifts her head again, all the Isomer girls have vanished. +Other than a girl who appears to have been the leader of the swarm, only M4A1 and ST AR-15 remain in the garden.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:...Why?
()||:The girl glances at M4A1 before directing her gaze at ST AR-15.
NytoIsomer(2)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:We were so close... +Why...why did you prevent our coalescence?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Coalescence? Stop spouting nonsense!
NytoIsomer(2)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:Your neural cloud is so similar to hers...so why do you reject us? +We should all become one! +So long as our minds all join together, we can leave this place and attain happiness!
()||:The girl's face grows even colder. +She raises her arms and the entire garden suddenly starts shaking.
NytoIsomer(2)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:It was all your fault... You ruined our chance to go home...
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why...do you want to merge with me?
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:I must lead everyone away from here; I've grown tired of waiting endlessly... +You are the most perfect out of all the Lunasias... Even SHE said you would accept us... Why...why do you regret it now?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What the hell are you talking about? I never agreed to this! Besides, I'm NOT Lunasia!
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:You are not...Lunasia? +No...that is impossible...!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I saw it in the memory fragments here - Lunasia is someone else! I...I'm just a Tactical Doll...nothing more and nothing less... +I don't want to hurt you. Let us leave before I completely destroy this place.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:You don't understand! We were all Lunasia! But only one Lunasia will remain in the end! +That's right... The most perfect one... Father will only accept the most perfect Lunasia... +Which isn't me...or any of us...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You were all...Lunasia?
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:We are failures - rejects that Father has discarded... +I am not worthy of the name "Lunasia". The same goes for everyone here. +The only person who deserves the name is standing right before me.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You mean...me?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4, don't listen to its bullcrap. We need to find a way out of here.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||:No...you cannot go.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The connection density has gone down. If we want to leave, it has to be now!

()||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2>:When M4 opens her eyes again, she finds herself in Tallinn.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:I'm back? +...No, that's not right. I'm still in the Level III base layer. +The connection with the Isomers was severed... What happened?
()||:M4A1 looks around and sees another Isomer dressed in rags walking towards her. +She raises her weapon out of reflex but finds that she's been immobilized.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Why can't I...)
()||:M4A1 peers down at her own body and realizes she's wearing the clothes of the Failed Isomer that she just met.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(This isn't me...)
()||:The Isomer stops right in front of M4A1, her face smooth and serene.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>Isomer Girl</Speaker>||:The new batch of flowers are almost ready. They will blossom any time now.
Failed Isomer's Voice()||:I see. Gather everyone then.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<白屏1>:(The voice is coming from over here...) +(Could this be her memory?)
()||<白屏2><BIN>157</BIN>:As M4A1's mind wanders, the scenery around shifts again. +This time, she is standing among a congregation of other Isomers in the center of the city ruins.
Failed Isomer's Voice()||<白屏1>:Thanks be to our Father. +We thank the Lord for His mercy. +When day and night intersect, the divine flowers shall bloom. +The holy light shall cleanse our worthless bodies and lift our spirits to Heaven, where we shall find bliss and rest.
()||<BIN>183</BIN>:The Epiphylla that fill the ruins all burst into bloom. +The entire space is washed in a fluorescent green light, and the Isomer girls standing all around start collapsing one after the other.
()||<白屏1>:...
()||<白屏2><BIN>157</BIN>:The light gradually fades away, leaving behind only a small group of Isomers and the girl from whose perspective M4 is observing the event, surrounded by wilting flowers. +After a long and agonizing period of silence, the girl finally opens her mouth again.
Failed Isomer's Voice()||<黑屏1>:Bless our departed friends. +May their souls find peace.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Then the same scene unfolds before M4A1 again and again. +It takes place at a different location each time, but the sequence of event is almost always the same. +The Isomers would gather at the site where Epiphylla are about to bloom and await their death. +This particular girl, who was once M4A1's enemy, would always remain standing in silence at the end of the ritual.
Failed Isomer's Voice()||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Why... +Why can't I be absolved?
()||<BIN>197</BIN><黑屏2>:After countless assemblies, the girl finally falls onto her knees in great despair. +She wraps her arms around herself as she weeps bitterly, her body shuddering with grief that is so profound, even M4A1 feels sorry for her.
Failed Isomer's Voice()||:They all died...and got their sweet release... +Why am I always left behind? +Father... What should I do? +Father... Please tell me... What on earth do I have to do to earn your forgiveness?
()||:Suddenly, M4A1 feels herself drifting away from the girl's body. +She gazes at the girl kneeling among a field of withered flowers with conflicted feelings.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(So they've been here the whole time, going through the same thing again and again...)
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏1>:The girl's figure gradually grows hazy, and when it finally dissolves completely, the scene around her also falls away like an avalanche.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_bigglassbreak</SE1><黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...You are one of many, countless victims. +Nevertheless, I must leave this place.
NytoIsomer(0)<Speaker>Failed Isomer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then destroy me. Destroy all of us. We no longer have a reason to exist. +To us, your rejection signifies the end of everything. Before you go, at least free us from this eternal purgatory...
