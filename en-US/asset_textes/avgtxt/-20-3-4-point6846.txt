Please read the following guide. +First, disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand, then switch on 【Music】 in the Settings interface. +When the rhythm bar reaches the line, tap the corresponding T-Doll skill icon accurately to score a combo. +Otherwise, the T-Doll will suffer a certain amount of damage. +Victory is achieved when at least one of your T-Dolls survives the whole song. +Final reminder – please disable 【Auto Skill】 beforehand and switch on 【Music】 in Settings to avoid being taken by surprise.
