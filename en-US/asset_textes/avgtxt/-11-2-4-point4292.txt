()||<BIN>10</BIN>:【Click】+【Audio File #004】+【Decryption complete. Start playing.】+Wanna try setting up a connection? +C-Connection? +Heheh, we're the same model. Our ports can be directly linked so I can send you my combat data. +Then...thank you. But my storage space... +It's fine! I've already compressed them into a size that you can handle. +That's perfect... But I still feel a bit iffy about the connection... +Huh? What's there to worry about? It's not dangerous. +I've only ever used the Zener Network for file transfer... This is the first time I've ever established a cable link... I don't know what's gonna happen... +It's actually not that different, and no one else can read our data exchange so it's very safe! +R-Really...? +There. I've sent the data. Try using it in your simulation training! +Sure...and thanks so much! +Haha, don't mention it. Oh right, let me show you something else. +Huh? What? +Heheh, photos I took secretly using the viewfinding authorization when I was out on a mission. +This is...? +Oh wow... This is gorgeous... +Sadly I won't ever get to take pictures like these out there... +Don't worry. You WILL get your own assignments some day. I'll show you how to access this function. +But...isn't it bad to do things without orders...?+It doesn't matter. They're just for myself. You don't have to ask for the commander's permission for everything. Remember, even T-Dolls have the right to do what they want! +Hmm...you have a point... +Then that's a promise!
