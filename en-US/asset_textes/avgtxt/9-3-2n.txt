T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:No, we're going the wrong way.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Why is this path sealed...?!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:You're such a rubbish guide, T77! It's all your fault!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.2</CGDelay>:There's no running...anymore...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Since the situation is pretty clear, I won't waste my breath. +M4A1, if you come out on your own accord, I might just keep you in one piece.
M4A1(3)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:I...I really am not Miss M4!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:To think the leader of the AR Team would use such an excuse to run away... How utterly dishonorable. 
M4A1(3)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:She isn't listening at all...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Look on the bright side, M3. +At least you can go sightseeing around the Sangvis base...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:I have to say, M4A1, you really are a disappointing sight. +You don't have the dignity of a leader. You even pick that Griffin grease gun, of all people, as the disguise for your signal... Couldn't you have picked someone else?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:... +Grease gun?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:This is your ultimatum. +Mastermind only ordered me to bring back your neural cloud. I'm giving you a choice to make this less painful.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:(Closes eyes) It really is over for us.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Grease gun?!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.7</CGDelay>:If you're not heeding my advice, then—
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:Hold it!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:What?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:...A figure appears at an elevated position not far from behind the group.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That's enough...Sangvis scum. +What are you trying to do to my sister?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Why...would you be here...? +Impossible. Hasn't Dreamer taken you to the Master?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Dreamer? You think so? +Is Dreamer such a reliable person to you? You might want to correct that assumption.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:No, what exactly...has Dreamer done?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I don't expect your infantile neural cloud to comprehend this. +I'll let you give it a good long think lying in a pool of your own blood.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:...Miss...M16?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker><Shake>||:Is that Miss M16?!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Am I...dreaming?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:M16... +No, wait. Miss T65! Hurry, the camera!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Oh!!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<震屏>:Hurry, hurry, hurry... +Arghhhh, why isn't it turning on when it counts? This rubbish camera! +Isn't our equipment 100% secure?!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Miss T65, watch out!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_h</SE1>:...Bang.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:I almost got hit... That was close... +Where the hell is the button to start recording?! +How am I supposed to work this piece of antique?!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Look, the light is on. +It's already started recording, you simply haven't taken off the lens cap.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<震屏>:Huh?? Oh!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...This...can't be happening, can it?! +Is that actually Miss M16?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Bang bang bang. +...Heavy fire aimed at Judge comes from another direction.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<震屏>:Keep running! +Move quickly to the extraction point!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss Thompson! +M16... She...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I'm not blind. +What are you standing there like statues for? +You think there's plenty of time for you to escape?!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:You can save yourself the effort.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:...Bang!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Ugh...dammit... +My leg...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Captain—
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss M3, we need a hand over here! Hurry!
M4A1(3)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Coming!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Stand aside. Executing the Master's orders is always the top priority. +She may not have instructed me on what to do with you, but if you get in the way, I will obliterate you... +M16A1.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Are those your last words, Sangvis scum?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>0,5</白屏1>:...M16 lobs an object at Judge. +...Clang.
()<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2>0,0.9</白屏2><黑屏1>0,0.7</黑屏1>:A...flashbang...?
