M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点1>:Commander, that's the situation over here.+The local Sangvis Ringleader has Negev's search team surrounded.+M4 and SOP-II are off to their rescue, but they can't hold the enemy off for long.+Comms signal is jammed in that zone. We could force our way through and rescue them, but there is a safer way.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑点2>:There's a Sangvis command post here that seems to be in charge of directing a number of their units.+And we're in luck - signal is normal around this command post, so you can direct our troops to take over it.+Then we can use it to confuse the enemy, which should make things much easier for M4 and the others.+So that's the idea, Commander. If you think it'll work, let's go.
