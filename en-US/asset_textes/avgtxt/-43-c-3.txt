MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;NPC-Dima(1)||:Springfield told us to leave the ammo, but if other players pick up the gear we leave behind, it'll be a threat to us.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:We'll take it all, then. Besides, it's not like Springfield will go through our backpacks.

MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;AA12(0)||:I've gotten rid of the enemies over here. Currently stocking up until my backpack is full, like Springfield said.+Shall we pick a place to meet up?

We haven't found one of the local bosses yet, but I think we ought to go on in.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>From what I can tell, there happens to be an entrance to the Dark Zone near the last boss. I'll send you the coordinates, so let's meet there.</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;M1903(10)||<黑屏1>:Roger. See you later.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>296</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Several minutes later, the four members of Squad Springfield meet at the appointed location.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene2</BGM>:We'll wait another minute. If the boss hasn't turned up by then, we'll just enter the Dark Zone. We can't delay any longer.
M1903(12);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Why don't we use this minute to stroll around the surroundings, then? +If we run into it, we'll open fire right away to get everyone's attention.
M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:That's a good idea.
M1903(10);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:See you later, then! +...Er, wait! Don't go yet, guys! +Look over there. That pile of stuff... Am I seeing things?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:...I can't quite believe my eyes, but you're onto something. +Why is there such a big pile of explosives over here?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:It would be very bad if they went off.+Even with maxed out gear, it'd still be game over, right?
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:It's just too dangerous.
M1903(12);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Yes, it's very dangerous... Springfield, why are you still going over there?
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Someone might get hurt if we left these things over here. We need to clear them up!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Just leaving it there is bad. We should take away as much as we can carry. +If there were anyone else nearby, a single shot could blow us all up.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;97type(0)||:You're right. We should take as much as we can.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#A9A9A9>You managed to persuade Springfield easily enough, Gr MP7.</color>
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<黑点1>:All right! Time to clean things out... I mean, clean things up!
()||<黑屏2>:Having reached a consensus, everyone starts to organize and gather the items.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Hm... I'm running out of backpack space. +I can't take all of it even if I hung it all over me...
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:I'm ditching some of the Molotovs.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Makes sense, these are way handier than the Molotovs. I'll ditch a few pieces of gear myself.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The terrain here is uneven. The Molotovs that 97 puts down roll across the ground.
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker><同时置暗>||:What was that... Who-who's there? +Who is it? State your name!
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Huh? Is someone else here?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:We came from the east. If there's someone behind the west wall, we wouldn't have seen her.
AA12(0);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Has the Eye of the Snow Wolf failed us?!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(4)||<黑屏1>:The wall was too thick, so we couldn't see through it. +In any case, prepare for a fight.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>299</BIN><SE1>RunStep</SE1>:The crisp sound of high heels treading across the ground approaches. Within seconds, a blonde-haired Doll storms up and stands before Squad Springfield.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You... What are you doing?! +That's my stuff! Put it down! Put it ALL down!
A91(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:Who do you think you are? You think something is yours just because you say it is? +We found it first, and it was all over the ground, like someone had been blown up.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Hah?
A91(0);M1903(13)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hang on, let me handle this.
A91(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<Size=25>Why don't you just shoot her...</Size>
A91(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Despite her grumbling, Type 97 nevertheless falls back with the other two and lets Springfield handle the situation. +Upon seeing Springfield, A-91 hesitates, and her finger eases off the trigger of her gun.
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Please relax. These explosives were a mess, so we were simply helping you tidy them up.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:You were tidying them up? Are you idiots or do you think I'm an idiot?
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:My apologies, but we have no hostile intent. +However, your equipment doesn't seem to be very good. Entering the Dark Zone like this might be risky for you.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:What are you trying to say?
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:I propose a trade. We have plenty of medicine and food here, as well as a fair bit of excess gear. +I wish to exchange these vital resources with you for some of these explosives. What do you think?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:I don't really care. I found them first, so why should I give them to you? +Plus, we're all out to kill each other here, so why should I believe you're proposing a fair trade?
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Hm... It does seem quite hard to believe. I understand how you must feel. +However, if we really wanted to, wouldn't it have been better for us to simply ambush you?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:It wouldn't because I'm alert and on my guard!
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:It is also because we honestly had no intention of attacking you in the first place. +The real battle is in the Dark Zone. If we wear each other down here, we won't be able to experience the most important content of the game.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:The most important content... True, if I don't enter the Dark Zone...
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:We are not enemies, at least not out here. +Winning is the most important thing, is it not? Now is not the time for us to fight with all our might. We need to survive.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(10)||:... +Humph, even so...
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You can think about it, but there isn't much time left. +Our progression speed will be affected if we don't enter the Dark Zone as soon as possible, so dragging this out is no good for us.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2><BIN>296</BIN>:As Springfield is negotiating with A-91, the other three are starting to get restless.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>What are the chances we can take her out in one hit from this distance?</color>
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Not high. Without using a scope, I might have to dump an entire mag to be sure.</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Isn't that a good thing? Why don't you go up and do just that?</color>
MP7(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not dumb, you know. She's carrying grenades and there are explosives everywhere. If we don't take her out in one shot, we'll be dead before we can even begin to run.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Springfield must be negotiating with her because she thought about that.</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>No wonder you managed to survive until now. I've underestimated you.</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Still, I don't think she's the type who'll listen to reason... Right, I've decided. If the negotiations don't work out, I'll give up right away, return her stuff and walk away.</color>

AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>I want to enter the Dark Zone and not fool around here.</color>
AA12(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>True, it's getting a little late. Tell you what, come over and give me some cover, AA-12.</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>What are you up to?</color>
AA12(0);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm going to steal some of the items while Springfield is dragging things out.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That way, even if we abandon the supplies, we'll come out on top.</color>
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>;97type(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>You'll get caught, you idiot.</color>
MP7(0);97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You won't know until you try!</color>
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(4)||:<color=#00CCFF>Fine, I'll block you for a bit.</color>
97type(4)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Sweet! Please, Springfield, delay her for just a little longer...</color>
97type(4)<Speaker></Speaker>||:While A-91 is being distracted by Springfield's words, Type 97 clutches the explosives she's holding tightly to her chest and begins tiptoeing off towards the Dark Zone. +However, she suddenly feels a keen gaze fall on her, and a shout from A-91 soon follows.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><震屏>:You, Twintails! Put my stuff down!
97type(5)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Ah! She spotted me! But how? I was really careful, wasn't I?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;97type(5)||:Did you think I wouldn't notice your little stunt just because I look drunk? +This is my normal working state! The more drunk I am, the keener my senses are.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:But that's water you're holding, right?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Just because you're acting all sneaky and stuff doesn't mean people really won't notice you... (Sighs). +There's four of us. We'll win if it comes to a straight fight.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Put my stuff down and leave and I might let you off.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Also, why do you have so many explosives piled up here? Are you going to blow yourself up?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Do you not take out your weapons to kill someone? Or do you beat them to death with your backpack, you moron?
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Kill someone? Who?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Not you. Be glad.
M1903(12)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Springfield frowns. She takes a step forward and shoots Gr MP7 a glance, telling her to back off. However, Gr MP7 doesn't get the message and keeps glaring at A-91.
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:If you're prepared to kill someone, then you should be prepared to have your trap taken down.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:What, you're going to lecture me? Think about who has the upper hand now!
A91(0);MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:Are you sure you're not misunderstanding something? +If it comes to a fight, you'll die before us.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:Gr MP7! Don't provoke her.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;MP7(0)||<震屏>:Oh?! You think I'm scared just because there's more of you? +I won't go before I get rid of her! These are the components for the trap I'm setting up. Don't even think of getting away with any of them.
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:...What a pain.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:But how can we be certain that you'll let us go if we put down those items? +Like you said, we've already stepped into your trap, haven't we?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;MP7(0)||<震屏>:You know this and you STILL want to talk terms with me? I am the ruler of this place! +I am the Abzolut god of vodka!
MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:AA-12 was right, she's a total drunkard and impervious to reason.
97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:If only there was a way to talk this over... +Hey, look, behind A-91... What's that in the fog?
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:It looks like the landmark boss we didn't find earlier... I'll head over to take care of him now.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;97type(0)||:Hey, that super insomniac over there! Where the hell do you think you're going with my stuff?!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;97type(0)||:There's an enemy behind you! Are you drunk on water or something?
AA12(0)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:As the enemy approaches, even Springfield's expression grows severe.
M1903(12)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:A-91, please listen to me... Right now, we're all in front of you and nobody is out of your sight, right? +There's a boss coming behind you. Let's put our differences aside for now and kill the boss before we continue this discussion, okay?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Really? Do you think I'm an idiot? Who knows how many people you have in your team? +And why should I believe a word of what you're saying when you tried a trick like that on me just now?!
A91(0);M1903(10)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:But he really IS walking up behind you, listen to the footsteps... +He's holding a Molotov cocktail. It's dangerous to stay here.
A91(0);97type(0)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A Molotov? According to my intel, the nearby boss doesn't have Molotovs.
A91(0);97type(5)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:...Wait a minute, was it the one I dropped just now?
A91(0);MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:I am SO going to beat the crap out of you when we get out of here, Type 97. Not even 95 will stop me. +Tsk! Get ready to fight!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:You there, the pink-haired one! Put your gun down! +If you point it at me again I'll set everything off!
AA12(0)<Speaker>AA-12</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:Crap, there's a devil up ahead and the deep blue sea beyond... +Can we try for an assault?
AA12(0);97type(5)<Speaker>Type 97</Speaker>||:There's no reasoning with this woman, if we try to launch an attack, she'll set everything off...
AA12(0);97type(5)<Speaker></Speaker><同时置暗>||:While they have been arguing, the enemy has drawn close. The sound of heavy footfalls echoes up and down the street, resounding in everyone's eardrums. +A-91 hears it too, but she's too focused on the four people in front of her to look away.
AA12(0);MP7(0)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:You idiot, this is the last time I'm going to warn you. Let's put our differences aside for now and take care of that guy before we argue about what belongs to who!
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;MP7(0)||:Who are you calling an idiot?!
A91(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:A red blast circle appears below A-91's feet, as if to prove Gr MP7's words. Although A-91 takes cover immediately, she still loses a big chunk of HP. +As she watches her HP bar shrink, A-91's alcohol-soaked patience finally snaps.
A91(1)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:AK-47 (hic) abandoned me here and put me in a humiliating situation, then you tried to pull a cheap stunt on me, and now even the enemy's bullying me! +If I can't enjoy the game, then neither will you! Time to die!
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Wait, we can give you...
A91(1)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;M1903(11)||:Shut up! I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
A91(1)<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:A-91 opens fire without letting Springfield finish. Springfield throws herself aside, and the bullets all strike the explosives piled up behind her.
M1903(11)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||:Oh no...
