M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>4</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:Good morning, Commander. And Miss Kalina.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:Hmm, the decryption was pretty easy. I found the third set of coordinates right away!
NPC-Kalin(1);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I find it hard to understand...how you figured out the decryption method.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||:That's 'cause it's a very primitive form of encryption that can't be decrypted just by AI.+I may not look like it, but I do know quite a lot of random things.
NPC-Kalin(0);M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But...if those are fragments of an T-Doll's neural cloud, why would they be encrypted in such a way...
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;M4A1(0)||<黑屏1>:That is the mystery. Whatever the case, let's look at the coordinates first.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2>:As indicated by the coordinates, it should be around here.+Commander, once you have cleaned up the field, the AR Team will acquire the new spoils for you.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:All right, Commander. Shall we?
