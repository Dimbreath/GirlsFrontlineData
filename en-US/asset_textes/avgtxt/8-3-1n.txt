Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Is there any mention of something like this in our past combat records?
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:I've studied everyone's records in detail back at the base, but none of us has ever seen anything like this...

Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:We don't have specialized equipment to check... but those animals were definitely lured here by something.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:That can't be right. Our rations couldn't possibly have lasted this long.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:...Our remains weren't necessarily the cause. I don't think our rations could've attracted this many rats either.
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:It just makes no sense for such a huge pack of animals to swarm around some T-Doll remains.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:The answer is pretty obvious at this point. +Is there any unidentified substance on the remains, G17?

Glock17(0)<Speaker>G17</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:It's become barely noticeable as time goes by, but something can be found on the remains... +I've listed all substances that share its chemical composition in everyone's recognition system.

BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Oh, now I remember. Griffin T-Dolls tend to forget all about how I killed them. +Heheh ♪... That's fine. I'm more than happy to describe how terrified you were again and again.

AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position><Speaker>AUG</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:... +Well, we planned your funeral, so it would only be proper of us... to come back and deliver an invitation.
AUG(0)<Position>0,-100</Position>;BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Those are some big words. You only returned alive the last time because you earned my admiration. +Talent like yours doesn't deserve to be wasted by serving under a leader like that. You should've replaced her long ago.

SSG69(0)<Speaker>SSG 69</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:What a dastardly plan. Aren't you gonna fight us fair and square?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Fighting you like that, gets old real quick. +After coming across such an interesting toy in that abandoned facility, I couldn't just leave it there. +That canister now contains something much more thrilling for humans.

IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:You sprayed us with poison... and the cargo isn't actually...!

I really have you to thank!
IWS2000(0)<Position>0,100</Position><Speaker>IWS 2000</Speaker>;BOSS-11(0)||<BIN>1</BIN><Night>:Sangvis Ferri is in such a sorry state because you don't understand the bonds between humans and T-Dolls.
