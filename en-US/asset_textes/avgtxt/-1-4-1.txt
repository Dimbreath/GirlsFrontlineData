Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Stop hiding. Your legs...have already given up on you, haven't they?
UMP9(1)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Y-y-y-you're Ouroboros?!+H-h-h-h-h-how did you find me?!
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||:Your ability to hide is no longer effective. Griffin's identification signals are all over the map now.
UMP9(1)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:How could this be...? It was hard enough for us to escape back there, and now...
Weaver(1)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't get me wrong, I'm actually very grateful that you survived the explosion...+What a pity it would be if I couldn't turn you into delectable corpses with my own hands!

UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Phew...+That banshee scares me with her shrieks even from several kilometers away.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Thank goodness she went crazy, otherwise she would've seen through your terrible acting.
G11(0);HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I thought this was supposed to be a covert operation... Do we really have to fight her?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(2)||:With enemy squads everywhere, I don't think we can make a sneaky getaway...
G11(2);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You two are a bunch of scaredy-cats. Take a leaf out of my book and just have faith in 45.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:You can't rely on me all the time. Trusting each other is our only hope.
UMP45(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Quit saying things that you don't even believe in yourself. Make good use of us so we can all escape.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>:Ouroboros is dying to chomp us down, so we cannot let her know that we're still alive.+We must first figure out where her command center is before I come up with the next step of the plan.+This will be our final objective of the entire mission so take it seriously.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is that your way of encouraging us, 45?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No, it's my way of threatening you.+Get a move on if you want to live ♪
