UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is it over...? +The number of connections are going down, but I already have what I want. +The experiment has been going on in this city for at least five years... +The consciousness of these failed Isomers have been merging and joining together the whole time, which actually makes it a lot easier for me to gather information.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:OGAS... The original source code of this AI was compressed into a program called "Parapluie", which activates the moment it is implanted into a host, overwriting all operating systems into OGAS systems. +After the alteration, if the host cannot cope with the massive computational load...the Isomer will suffer brain damage, and in a T-Doll's case, the neural cloud will be fried. +Which is why at Griffin, other than M4, all the other Dolls are failures... I knew it - Persica has everything to do with this.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Looking at it this way, once a Doll has contracted the virus, there are only two possibilities - either she experiences a neural meltdown, or she becomes a host for OGAS. +Which means the fellow in my base layer is also a simulation derived from a feeble OGAS... +Should I be thankful for the fact that my neural cloud has very limited space, or that my OGAS isn't particularly "clever"?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Still...I think I finally understand what really happened during the Butterfly Incident. +Why they chose us... Why they chose M16... It all makes sense now. +Since that time, we've been pawns on the chessboard... And now I've finally figured out what exactly these chess pieces are for. +I am getting closer and closer to the truth.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But M4A1 is clearly the key to this entire business, and she's so powerful, so why hasn't she done anything up till now?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:Tsk. The connection is shifting again... An external connection.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:No...this doesn't feel right. Is it already time to wrap up this operation?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Can...can you move?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ja, I can! Did 45 win?
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:But what happened to that weird, mumbly enemy?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That body has been abandoned.
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:45 slowly gets to her feet. She gives the Isomer who's cupping M4's cheek a light shove, and the Isomer topples onto the ground like a corpse.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh, 45! Are you alright?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thanks to them, I managed to escape from the connection maze.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Coughs)
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Is this the real world...?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Welcome back, AR Team. +I know you're still feeling groggy, but I'm guessing the worst is about to happen any second now, so I suggest you smack yourselves awake and get moving right away.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're...the leader of Squad 404? Don't worry, I've sent away the Isomer who's been causing the interference. It's over.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:15, are you alright? I think we'll have to acquire access authorizations for the quarantine wall some other way, but since the interference has been neutralized, it shouldn't be too danger—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:BOOM!
()||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:The sound of a massive explosion comes from the distance, followed by a series of continuous blasts.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What's going on?!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:Huh?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is it a bombardment?!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:"It's over"? No, no, I believe you're terribly mistaken. This is the exact moment the enemy has been waiting for. +Back when we broke free of the virtual space, I sensed a new connection between the Isomer and somewhere outside Tallinn. Do you know what that means? 
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...A connection with somewhere outside Tallinn?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That thing in your mind is likely the target that the culprit behind everything is after, and you gave it away just like that. +Now that they've achieved their objective, their next step would be to bury us all here. 
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:M4, 15, you're okay! Hmm? When did you get here, Squad 404?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:All of us were under attack from the forced connections, so we came over to regroup.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Is that so...? But we have more important things to discuss.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Just now we received word from the Commander that Tallinn City Station came under artillery fire. Our forces have detected a military armored train heading straight for us, so we have to rush back and set up our defenses!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:A few minutes ago.
()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Outside of Tallinn. +In the command center on board the Intercontinental Railway.

NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Understood. +I'm guessing the AR Team must've done something... +Keep an eye on enemy movements. +Have our echelons resume their original mission.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Roger that!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Now we just have to wait for their next report...
()||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:An incoming transmission.
M1895MG(0)<Speaker>M1895 CB</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, this is Squad Desert Eagle!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Our Leader told me to inform you that they'd spotted something moving at high speed towards you via another railway track which goes through Tallinn!</color>

M1895MG(0)<Speaker>M1895 CB</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Cough... All our signals are still accounted for. We're fine...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>That train is mounted with multiple cannons... Watch out, Commander...</color>
M1895MG(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Acknowledged. +M1895 CB, tell your team to follow the original plan and proceed to the next rallying point.

()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<:...Ack!
()||<黑屏1>:As the blast goes off, the entire train shakes violently.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:The lights installed on the ceiling keep flickering and go out eventually.
()||<BGM>10065</BGM><SE1>AVG_keyboardtype_sci</SE1>:I grab hold of the edge of the desk to keep my balance, then I snatch up my tablet from among the objects that have scattered all around in the tremors and activate the comms channel.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Kalina?!
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, I'm okay!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>How is it on your end?</color>
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'm alive, no injuries. +Take stock of our casualties... Never mind, leave it. +Order all echelons to stick to the original plan and execute Operation Golden Fleece at once.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Are we really carrying out such a risky plan?</color>
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:The quarantine wall is still closed; even if they manage to open it, there's no guarantee that we can escape. +So let's give those disgusting stalkers a little surprise. Besides, to be completely honest, Havier is such a tightwad for giving us this rickety train. I want to switch to something bigger and comfier.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Commander... This is way too reckless... But who cares? Since when have you NOT been reckless?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It's about time we showed those green bastards we aren't to be messed with!</color>
()||<黑屏2><BIN>208</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1>:Meanwhile, 416, who's currently scouting the area from a high vantage point in the city ruins, spots a giant mechanical beast making a beeline for Tallinn.
()||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:The fading sunset does nothing to soften its harsh outline. Instead, it dyes the armor plates a horrific shade of blood.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That looks like extremely bad news...
()||:As the dual-rail train approaches, its cannons swivel around to point straight at Tallinn City Station.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's the situation?</color>
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It appears to be a military armored train. Whoever sent this seems dead set on blowing us to kingdom come.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>That's only to be expected. This entire city is worth absolutely nothing for them.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Worst case, we'll have to give our friends the slip. Armored trains are far beyond what we can deal with.</color>
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:How will the Commander fare against this?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;HK416Mod(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>The Military couldn't have sent a single train. The Commander might be able to handle one, but when the Military launches a saturation attack, even the Commander won't last long.</color>
UMP45Mod(0);HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Tsk...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>159</BIN>:So, dearest friends from the AR Team, now that we find ourselves in such a dire situation, how should we prepare for what's to come?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I just got in touch with the Commander. All Griffin echelons have already repositioned. For some reason, I have a feeling that the Commander anticipated this... +Right now Miss Kalina is dispatching supplies and Dummies to our forces. As for us, we've been told to head back and help set up a defense line.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Set up a defense line, eh...? Looks like you still have time, M4.
UMP45Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What do you mean?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)||:The Parapluie virus is irreversible. You don't really believe that OGAS has disappeared from your neural cloud for good, do you?
UMP45Mod(0);M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...! +I don't understand what you're getting at.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(3)||:Oh? Then let me put it this way - don't you intend to retrieve the important thing that you've lost?
UMP45Mod(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...haven't lost anything important.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ah, so you insist on keeping that secret? +I see. You're planning to run away from the whole thing.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>Rope</SE1>:45 walks up to M4 with a smile. She suddenly grabs M4 by the collar and jerks her right up to her own face.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Are you freaking kidding me?! Do you still think of yourself as a tragic heroine?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What are you doing? Let go of her!
()||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:45 releases her grip on M4 and shoves her back.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I thought the AR Team was oh-so-amazing; your leader has such a mighty body and a neural cloud that can even contain OGAS. But it seems that's just a total waste of your brilliant specs.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Can't you sense it? Your leader is always doing things that defy Doll logic. Don't you think she's hiding something?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What are you not telling us, M4??
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I...
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4... +I think it's time you let us in on your secret. I told you before - we're your backing. You no longer have to bear this on your own.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, you ARE special, but if you let this go on, you will end up getting yourself, your team, and the entirety of Griffin killed.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is the moment of truth, M4A1. +This decision may cost you your peaceful status quo, but running away will cost you your the entire future. +You think just because that voice disappeared, everything's over? No, this is merely the beginning!
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I...understand.
