RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Should be, but do you see... +Uh...Tactical Doll M1887?
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:No. According to the data, a T-Doll had indeed been here, but that was three hours ago. +Can't be helped. We'll have to contact Helian.

M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Calling Griffin HQ. +Is this Miss Helian?
计量官()<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Sorry, you got the wrong channel... +Griffin.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...?!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Who are you?!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Sangvis Ferri Manufacture SP 21 "Gager". +None of you will be leaving this place, AR Team and all present Griffin T-Dolls. +You're completely exposed the moment this connection was established.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:...
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;BOSS-7(0)||:(So...we weren't exposed until just now?)
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I applaud your courage and determination to survive, but I'm afraid your existence will soon come to an end. +Do please enjoy your final moments as you're about to be completely surrounded by Sangivs units... +And all hopes shall be lost for you.

BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Wow! That's a cool speech, Gager! +Show those half-baked T-Dolls who are the real pros!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:(Sighs) You're hardly a pro either, horsing around all day...
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey, I AM giving the cannons a proper run! +You see those out there? I installed all those cannons in a row. Imagine how cool it's gonna be when they fire all at once!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Is that why you set them all up together? +At this rate, not even I can guarantee we have enough resources to keep the operation going...
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:No biggie. This looks neat and tidy, right?! +Besides, I'm your superior! Isn't it your duty to assist me?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Sure. Then as your adjutant, I'm heading out for some pest control.
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh? Is that necessary? Isn't it fine to just leave them alone?
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:By "pest", I also mean the remaining trio of the AR Team.
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:WHAT?! Then I'm coming too!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Who's going to take care of the base if you're also out? Not to mention they'll have to pass by the base on their way out. +Just wait here patiently and notify me the moment you detect their whereabouts.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okie dokie! Move along! I'll keep the hearth warm!
