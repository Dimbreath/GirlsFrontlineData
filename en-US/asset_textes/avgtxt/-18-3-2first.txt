M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:AR-15...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What is it?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:When...you were in that building back then... +And you knew you were about to die...what were you thinking?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Did you ever consider what you would do if...your sacrifice was for nothing? +Even if you didn't care about what we thought, what if—
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If I didn't do it, none of us would have been able to get out of there. +The situation back then would have killed everyone, including you. +And that principal order of mine didn't allow me to permit such an outcome.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Even...if it meant sacrificing yourself...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Everyone in the AR Team with the exception of yourself was created to protect you. +That was the most fundamental order Persica gave us, and the pretext behind every action we took. +We went through many iterations in order to be strong enough to protect you... +While I didn't have much experience, M16 had been through many battles already, which was why Persica allowed you to operate on the battlefield.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...RO once said that she was made for the express purpose of saving me...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:So she was the same, huh... +Looks like Persica really cherishes you. +You truly are a lucky Doll.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It wasn't my intention to make you sacrifice yourselves for me over and over again... +If I had a choice, I'd rather be the one who disappeared...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Unfortunately, we're Dolls, and we never had the right to choose in the first place.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Yet you still came by your own will, didn't you?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Ange needed more hands to complete her mission. +And I had no reason to refuse her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Whatever your reasons, you've already made your decision...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +If you've steeled yourself to walk my path... +Then the last thing I can do is to remind you that more people hope for your safety than you think.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +If all you needed to stop me was to take me down, could you do it?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Take you down? +You mean snapping off your legs and carrying you around the whole day all over again? +Forget it. We both know even if I did that, it wouldn't change your mind.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:AK-12 once said that you're actually so intent on finding SOP-II, you could barely focus on your mission. +Now I believe it.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm the leader of the AR Team, and I have a responsibility to bring them home, AR-15. You matter much more to me than my revenge.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I guess hearing you say that has put me at ease. +But M4, if you pursue this matter, you must not consider yourself the biggest sacrifice you can make, do you understand?  +I'm no longer bound by that principal order, but the others aren't like me. +If you want to die, think about SOP-II's smile first.
()||:M4 smiles.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...We've got a hard battle ahead of us. +Go rest and recharge first. I'll keep an eye on the surroundings. We'll alternate shifts.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:... +You don't need to come up with such an excuse to give me the slip. +I won't even bother looking for you.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I forgot this wasn't the AR Team anymore... +...Well, that's fine too... In that case...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Even if this isn't the AR Team anymore, you're still my team leader... +I'm sure you have some compelling reason to do this alone... +And I respect your decision.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:... +Thank you, AR-15.
()||:AR-15 turns her back on M4.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Just this once. +Bring them back with you. Don't let our sacrifices be in vain.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:It's time for your scheduled call-in. Anything you want to report? Are you still alive?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:AK-12, huh... +M4's...gone AWOL.
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Oh, Ange knew she'd do that. In any case, there's a new rendezvous point. You'd best hurry over.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:...Since she knew this would happen and took no precautions... +Am I right to understand that she's using M4 as bait for Sangvis Ferri?
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:She's just bait for now. The Military has already shaken off Griffin's blockade and is heading your way. +If you don't hurry, the bait might just end up becoming a sacrificial lamb.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:How much longer do we have?
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:30 minutes at most.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:So little time... +I have one more question. Does Ange plan on having all of us survive?
AR15Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:From what I know of her, she couldn't care less about herself. +You'd know, given the events in the Safe House 3.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;AK12(0)||<黑屏1>:...Then I'll trust her one more time.
