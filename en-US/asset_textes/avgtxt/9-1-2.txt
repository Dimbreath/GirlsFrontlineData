NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：...I recall that you haven't returned to HQ even once since you had completed the recruit training. +You did well in recovering File No.7. We've managed to extract a lot of valuable information.+With this, the military has expressed their interest in cooperating with us.+That's right, we shall soon have the chance to carry out a joint operation to fully repel Sangvis Ferri. Perhaps we may even resolve this entire conflict.+As for that Doll...my condolences to you. I have also known her for a long time now. I will provide you with the support you need, and wish you all the best.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：However, besides the rescue operation, you have something even more important right now... A public relations mission.+Helian should have briefed you earlier. We are heading to the military conference, where they will be making an important announcement.+They will be working together with a private enterprise to carry out T-Doll testing and participate in a demonstrative exercise.+That's right, that private enterprise is us, Griffin & Kryuger Private Military Contractor.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>："The shining beacon in a brave new world", do you still remember? Kalina should've mentioned it to you when you first joined.+We've fought with Sangvis Ferri for so long that this founding ideal of ours has been sidelined, but I've never forgotten...+And now, it's time to end these inane days.+On the surface, this exercise will be a demonstration for the media, but in actuality, the military will be providing troops to help us carry out a counterattack on Sangvis Ferri.+I'm sure you're aware that with the might of the military, it should take no longer than three days.+I hope that you will command our forces during this operation as you've been at the forefront of the Sangvis Ferri resistance, and as such, you are the most qualified to do so.
