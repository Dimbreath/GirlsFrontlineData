()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>168</BIN><BGM>GF_EV3_Bingocard_loop</BGM>:SOP-II lets out a long sigh...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sighhhhhhh... Nothing in her optic records either...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:The maid Doll wanders off in confusion, as if she suddenly had woken up.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Bye-bye, Miss Adorable Little Maid. +Uh... That was the 555th... +How many more Dolls do we have to check till we can finally see some hope?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We went in a huge circle...only to end up right where we started... +Commander, are you sure the informant we're looking for is in this zone?
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Stop complaining. All the Commander has to work on is a single photograph, and we can't afford to advertise our presence right now. +All we can do is try to trace this person's whereabouts by screening optic records of Dolls. +Still, this is much easier compared to my old missions in law enforcement. Some stakeouts could take an entire month.

RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II waves her mechanical arm and it expands in a sudden flourish.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>||:Bam!! Look, isn't this cool?!
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Alright alright, put that scary arm of yours away.
RO635-NoArmor(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Arghhhhh this is BOOOORING! +No matter how you look at it, finding our target by going through Doll records is way too hard! Isn't there any way to make this more efficient?
RO635-NoArmor(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||:Hmm...there is something we can try to obtain more information, but we might have to cross the line. +The Commander did say we shouldn't do anything too conspicuous... 
RO635-NoArmor(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Even if we lay low, it's pointless if we can't complete our objective. We're not here to sight-see, you know!
RO635-NoArmor(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)||<黑屏1>:You're right. Then let's get just a little bit of help from this city.
