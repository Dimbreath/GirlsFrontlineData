()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Pushing open the door reveals a dark and empty theater stage.
()||:The debris all over the ground, the bullet holes scattered across the room, and the pungent smell of burnt flesh all indicate that a ferocious battle took place here not long ago.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Looks like we're alone.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But this is where they last communicated with us. Where have they gone...?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏闪光>:Whoosh!
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><Shake>||:It's...Sangvis Ferri! You're from back then...
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:It's been a long time, ditzy young lady. Have you missed me?
()||:Executioner dashes at them from behind with her long blade, but M4 blocks her attack with her weapon case.
()||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Before M4 can reply, a swift and accurate burst of bullets forces Executioner to take evasive maneuvers.
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:Stay back, M4! Leave this to...whoa!
()||<白屏闪光>:Clash!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:An unfamiliar Griffin Doll. What interesting prey. +However, Executioner said she wanted to take M4A1's head as a souvenir...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:...So you mustn't get in the way.
()||:A large amount of Sangvis units come swarming into the theater and start launching a fierce attack under the coordination of the two Sangvis ringleaders.
()||:M4A1 and AK-12, now separated from each other, have to fight alone on opposite ends of the auditorium.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Hahahahaha, you've grown a lot stronger, but so have I! +It's been a while since I last fought such an exhilirating battle!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>I expected this, but their numbers are far greater than I imagined...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>If we don't take out the ringleaders soon, we're going to waste a lot of time here...</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:There's a hidden passage in this theater that leads where everyone is trying to get to.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Do you know where it is?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:One of the floorboards in the backstage area is hollow.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But if I go in blindly, I could run into even more S.F. and white units...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:And AK-12 is...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:You'll have to go around the Sangvis units. As for the white ones, I can handle them no matter how many of them there are.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:If you want to help your partner, you'll have to trust me. You should also have some faith in your friend.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Then...AK-12!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:...!
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The moment their eyes meet, Executioner's and Hunter's attacks force them apart and send them running again.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:As if we'd let you join forces.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Why are you running? Fight me fair and square, M4A1!
()||:Backed to the edge of the auditorium, M4A1 stops and turns around. Executioner flashes her a genuine smile.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:That's it! Let's fight until one of us drops dead!
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Do it!
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Huh?
()||<BGM>bossbattle_loop</BGM><SE1>Explode</SE1>:A massive explosion goes off.
()||:The Sangvis forces are blown up into pieces, their debris falling all around like unseasonal snow. +The explosion has blasted a large hole on half of the theater wall, dust and rubble come crashing down onto the stage like a landslide.
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Cough cough...! That...was a bomb? When...
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Watch out, Executioner!
()||:The explosion has thrown Executioner onto the stage. The last image she sees is M4 lifting her weapon case and aiming at her.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:With a deafening boom, Executioner is reduced to ashes along with the stage.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:That was trickier than I expected...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Good thing we anticipated the possibility of walking into an ambush and rigged a bomb outside beforehand.
()||<SE1>Runstep</SE1>:Beneath the decimated stage, M4 finds the entrance to the secret passage and runs up to it.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'm leaving things here to you!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Go, M4!
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:No matter what you want to do, do it!
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:You think we'll let you have your way?!
()||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:A heavily-wounded Hunter aims her gun at M4's back, but AK-12 shoots her weapon out of her hands.
BOSS-3(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Ugh! +You Griffin bastards...!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Sangvis Manufacture Model SP721, "Hunter", isn't it? +Actually...I'm not with Griffin. +And just like your friend, you will soon pay the price for your ignorance.
