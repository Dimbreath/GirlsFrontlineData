()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:Combat over. SOP-II proceeds to M4's hideout.+...+......
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...No.+I forfeit this order.+This...is not what friends should be.
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:If you want me to be that kind of friend, you'll have to order me.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I will keep waiting. Until the day you willingly do so.+This is what you owe me, AR-15. I will keep on waiting...
()||<BIN>3</BIN><火花><黑屏2>:...+Meanwhile, outside an abandoned building.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+The last of the gang finally shows herself...+As always, you're such a foreboding presence...
M16(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...M16A1.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I must see you one last time while I can still afford the risk...+I'll knock you out and drag you back if that's what it takes.
AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'm sorry for screwing things up, but please don't get in my way. This is my own business.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:At least tell me what you know, AR-15.+What on earth have you been through all this time...?
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+I'd been digging around the Sangvis database for the last couple of days, trying to uncover the truth behind Plan Parapluie.+While investigating a Sangvis factory, I accidentally set off a signal disruptor.+I had a dream again that night. Then I woke up and realized comms were completely down.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:Was it caused by the disruptor? Did it somehow trigger your Parapluie program?
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yes. Now that I think about it, the disruptor probably installed a jamming module on Parapluie...+I lost all means of communication and didn't want to drag Griffin into this mess. That's why I went into hiding here in Area S08.+Then the series of events...ensued...
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:It wasn't your fault, AR-15.+If it hadn't been for the information you left behind, none of us would even have known that's Plan Parapluie.
M16(2);AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I got careless. Then I lost my cool and couldn't think of a way to fix my mistake. That's how Griffin ended up in this pitiful state...+I handed everything I've learned over to SOP-II in the hope that it can salvage the situation, even for just a little...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(2)||:Don't despair just yet, AR-15! Things are still salvageable!+With Alchemist out of the picture, Sangvis forces are already in complete disarray!+Look at their units - scrambling around like bugs! They're effectively leaderless!
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+You know nothing, M16.+The confusion among the enemies' ranks isn't the result of Alchemist's demise...+Rather, it's caused by the staggering rage of their actual leader, who's hellbent on destroying us!+...Well, all of us except M4A1.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:So you're off to find them? What good will that do?+If you're going, at least take me along!
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I've learned a few things from Negev, including their location, the forces stationed in that area...+And...the number of friendly T-Dolls that need rescuing there.+I'm leaving them to you, M16.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:So, you're playing the hero on your own?+You'll only end up getting caught without achieving anything!
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:No, I won't. At least...they won't catch me alive.
()||:AR-15 displays a small switch.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:A detonator of high explosives...? Where did you get it?
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Negev gave it to me. I rigged the explosives under the building.+I'll have no regrets dragging this many Sangvis units to hell with me...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;AR15(0)||:What are you talking about, AR-15?!+Don't you want to make it back to our control center?! Don't you want to enjoy more victories?!+Among the four of us, aren't you always the one with the biggest thirst for glory?!
M16(3);AR15(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sorry, but I'm terribly austere...+The way I see it, a Tactical Doll should live as a soldier...and die as a soldier...+Perishing together with my enemies on the battlefield... Don't you think that's the most fitting end for me?
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Slap!+...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:(Laughs) That hurts, M16.+Is that the way...to treat a hero...?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Shut up, AR-15...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You can't talk me out of this. You know that...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I said shut up! You hear me, AR-15?!
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:One more word...+One more word...and I'll kill you...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...+There's...no other way...+I've been planted with the Parapluie program. There's no going back for me...+And every minute we delay may result in another Griffin casualty...+Let me do something, M16. Let me do something for you...in my final moments...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...+AR-15, how am I supposed...to explain this...+To SOP-II...and M4...
AR15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Well...+Just tell them I'm off...to fulfil my final wish...
