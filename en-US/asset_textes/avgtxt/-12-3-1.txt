HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:How long have we been in here, 9?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hmm...+Several hours?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:(Sighs)......+I think I'm almost at my limit.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't give me that. You went offline to rest just a while ago, didn't you?+Look at Gr G11, she's having a blast.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Don't compare me to that koala. She can last in there 'til World War IV as long as someone keeps her fed with rations.+I want some real rest; even regular combat isn't this tiring...
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Special circumstances, so hang in there.+I'm uploading the fragments you found to Dier, but we're missing one last piece.+After that, we'll be able to wake 45 up and get out of here together.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:The only good news right now is that there's no bad news. I hope there won't be any other surprises in store for us...
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Chuckles weakly) You do love raining on others' parade, don't you? Why not think a little more positive, 416?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Me? Forget it... Someone's got to play the bad guy.+9...what'll you do if we can't save 45?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:...I don't know. It's too early to ask me that question.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:I thought you would already have an answer prepared.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I'm not like 45. I don't have everything figured out.+I only think about doing what's in front of me until 45 is satisfied.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:What a heartwarming relationship you have.+Now that we have the chance, can you tell me how you met 45?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Will you tell me what you saw of 45's neural cloud?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Can't you just read the report?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't want to...+Or rather, I don't dare...+Maybe I'm just waiting for her to tell me in person.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Humph, weirdo.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Beep.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Hey! 416, aren't you going to get a move on?+We're just one step away from fixing 45's neural cloud!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Got it, I'm going now.+9, don't forget about the situation outside. S.F. is certainly searching for us.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Don't worry. The Tactical Fairies are keeping a constant lookout.+If anything happens, I'll have the echelons fight them off!
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:I'm not too reassured by 9's leadership...
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Humph, is that so?+It just so happens that my leadership skills are limited, so guess I'll only save 416!
HK416(0);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hey! You got a network command module with a commander's data saved in it, right?+So you're an elite Griffin commander now! You can't just leave me for dead!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Be careful, 9.+I'm not sure who the Ringleader is this time, but I am certain that they'll be very dangerous.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:Mhmm, leave it to me!+(I have to keep everyone safe until 45 wakes up...)+(They're the last family I have, and...I MUST protect them!)
