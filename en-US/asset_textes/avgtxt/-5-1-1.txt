NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:Good morning, Commander. +Good work in the previous rescue mission. It must have been tough mobilizing so many teams on such short notice. +The ad-hoc operation was extremely risky, but we gave the green light because we have complete faith in you. +We will give you a special award in honor of your valor. +However, the battle is not over yet, and we're giving you a special assignment...
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Let me do the talking, Helian.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:Long time no see, Commander. +While we were on the way, the captured Sangvis unit mentioned something...
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey, I have a name! I'm Architect! +And that was a slip of the tongue! Don't believe me!
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Please refer to the screen...
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>48</BIN>:According to the Sangvis unit, this is a cannon that Sangvis Ferri modified independently from the prototype of a military weapon. +I'm curious how Mastermind managed to make such calculations with just the AI of T-Dolls.
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Humph, we're all very clever! Aren't you jealous?
帕斯卡()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||:Meanwhile, I'm also very curious about the Military's weapons tech. +Which is why, Commander, Kryuger has agreed to dispatch a large squadron to transport a prototype of the Jupiter cannon.
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Hey, that is our baby! I won't let you take it apart! Or move it away!
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Redo her gag, Tommy.
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Mmmm...! Hnnnng...!
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><黑屏1><BIN>8</BIN>:The only problem is this mortar is huge, so it's gonna take some time to have it dismantled and transported. +Before we're done, could you please fend off the Sangvis attack? +It's not gonna take too long, Commander. You have my thanks.
