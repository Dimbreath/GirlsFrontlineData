NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:Commander, there's something we've been keeping from the AR Team.+Mr. Kryuger discovered a copy of AR-15's neural cloud during our last operation.+It might have been left behind deliberately by AR-15, but some content is missing.+Please have the AR Team collect the missing fragments, but don't let them read the content.+I'm handing this to you, Commander. I trust your judgement.
