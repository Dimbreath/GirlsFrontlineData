RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Commander, the other armored train is hot on our heels!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Persistent, aren't they... Can we shake them off?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:This is the fastest we can go! Since the trains are of the same model, we can't lose them with just speed.
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><震屏>:With another artillery blast, the train rocks violently again. +Everyone has to grab hold of something in the carriage in order to stay on their feet.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Return fire with our own cannons!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Easier said than done! +Their shields are fully intact while we're missing several of our cannons. Fighting them head-on isn't going to end well for us.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:UMP45, can you locate the shield generators on a train of this model?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sure. +Commander, you've got any brilliant ideas?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I do have a possible solution...

()||<BGM>BGM_Reverse</BGM>:The armored train under Griffin's control gradually decelerates. +The AR Team stay behind cover on the roof and wait for the Military's train to close in.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I didn't expect the Commander to do this. It totally took me by surprise.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:We always manage to survive against impossible odds because the Commander is willing to give such orders... It'll be no different this time.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I agree with the Commander's judgment. +Our objective is very straightforward - take out the shield generators in the middle section of the train and leave the rest to the cannons.

M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No problem. +Oh, by the way, RO, AR-15, we should get this done quickly 'cause we still need to pick M4 up!
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Of course. We can't let M4 miss the train.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The enemy train is in attack position. Let's go!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Alright, off we go!
