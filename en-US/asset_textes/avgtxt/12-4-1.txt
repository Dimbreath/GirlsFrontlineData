AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Thank goodness the blizzard died down so soon.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Hopefully those who won't fire at us haven't gone too far.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are we heading towards the initial theater? Didn't you say Ange and the Commander had already switched positions?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I'm trying to take the fastest route.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But didn't you say there were new enemies around?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Have we run into any of them?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...No. +But this doesn't look like the shortest route. Rather...it feels as if we've been going in circles.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:This is the safest, hence the shortest route. Besides, the unidentified units in the area are growing in numbers.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Unidentified units... +You'd better be telling the truth.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>161</BIN><Night>:Looks like we're here.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4A1 and ST AR-15 once again made it back to the theater. +Much to their surprise, the area was longer echoing with gunshots. +Not even a single moving thing could be seen.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:It would seem that the dirty bomb's effect is still spreading. There's no sign of humans in this area.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They've all either escaped or mutated.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:They just left their haywire autonomous units by the road. Good thing they aren't firing at us.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:They must've relocated all the units that were still under control. Both sides must've vacated the area completely.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:It's only been half a day... +You see that just ahead?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's where we came from.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Neither enemies...nor allies are here.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We can't detect DEFY's signals, nor have we spotted Ange's corpse, which means...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:They all made it out.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I knew Ange wouldn't give up so easily. +Should we go after her?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Initially, I would have rejected that idea to keep Lunasia safe. +But compared to the route we would have to take to traverse the city, it might actually be less dangerous to follow Ange's tracks.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You can tell which direction Ange is headed?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I can deduce her movements based on the residual signal, but I can't guarantee absolute certainty.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:That's better than nothing.
()||:M4 jumped onto the roof of an abandoned jeep and surveyed the surroundings.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Hmm... Judging by the tracks around us, they should've retreated in this direction.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Are you sure? +I can't really tell the difference. +But if you say so, then let's head that way and have a look.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Right. Still, even without the Military, finding Ange will not be an easy task.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:True... I can hear them too. The ELIDs in the area are starting to close in on us.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Give me your secondary weapon. We must eliminate the most immediate obstacles.
