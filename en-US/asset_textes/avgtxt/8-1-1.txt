()||<BIN>18</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Two months after the conclusion of Operation Arctic Warfare.+...Morning, outside a military branch.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：We shouldn't meet if we can help it...
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><Position>0,-130</Position>||：...General Carter.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：You're right. IF we can help it... But this meeting is necessary. I'm here to give you some reminders.+You should thank Central Command for organizing this PMC Reception. We wouldn't have had the chance to arrange this unofficial meeting otherwise.+My car is just round the corner down this street. It won't take long.
()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑点1>：...Kryuger nods. Brigadier General Carter follows him into Griffin's private vehicle.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>：Judging from Lyco's AI data, we're onto something.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker><Position>-100,-130</Position>||：And I'm sure your 'something' must be so insignificant you didn't even bother to report it.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：That's because...we've been having some minor issues. We still need some time to resolve them.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：(Sighs) Berezovich, you're my former subordinate, that's why I've been doing you favors.+I've granted all your requests so far, extra quota for the maximum number of T-Dolls you can employ, smuggled weapons, even media blackouts in areas under your jurisdiction.+These are already far beyond my authority. I hope you understand.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：Of course... I know how much you're risking.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Then you should also know what it is that we want.+You don't like talking about politics, but even you should know that world order is being overhauled in an unprecedented way.+A brand new form of nation is about to be established, and the military is also about to undergo a large-scale internal reshuffling.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：Is that the conception of "those people"...that you mentioned before?
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：(Nods) The opportunity is right before you. If you still can't deliver any result...+Then nobody will defend you at the next staff conference. You know what that means.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Carter(0)||：...
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：The military doesn't care which side wins. The technology to develop the next generation of military Dolls is the only thing that can be used as a bargaining chip against them.+You've already failed once. Don't fail a second time.+Ah, this is where we turn. My car is just ahead.
()||：Kryuger raises his hand and the sedan comes to a stop. Carter opens the door.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：I will make haste...General Carter.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker><Position>0,-130</Position>||：I hope so, or I'll have to find someone else for help.+Thanks for the ride. I'll see you at the banquet.
()||：Brigadier General Carter takes his leave.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑点1>：...+Keep driving.+Leave the branch and go in circles. I need to make a call.
 ()||<黑点2><BIN>22</BIN>：...Meanwhile, at 16Lab.+...Beep.+...Beep. Beep.
Persica ()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：...+Ugh...+Who's this...?+Oh...Kryuger.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker><通讯框>||：You promised us progress within the next few days.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：M4A1... I'll be waking her up soon. I've had a breakthrough...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：This isn't the time to wake her up. There's something more important.+You mentioned before that all of Lyco's data could be restored if we had File No. 7.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：According to the information the AR Team collected in Safe House 3...that is correct.
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：You also said that we could find it within a day if we're lucky.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Yeah... The location should be confirmed pretty soon, but you know we've got that Sangvis jamming thing going on...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：That's exactly what I want to talk to you about.+The AR Team and that commander are all yours now.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Ah... You know me so well, Kryuger.
NPC-Persica(2);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：You already owed me once about "Jupiter". This is the second time.+I need results before dinner tonight. Give me your word.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||：Sure. You'll get what you want...+By the way, Kryuger...
NPC-Persica(0);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：Go on.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>;NPC-Kyruger(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Was Lyco's death...really an accident?+I'm sorry, but you're so obsessed with the stuff he left behind so I just...
NPC-Persica(3);NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||：...We've already had this conversation many times.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||：Right...+Then that's all.
()||：...Kryuger ends the call.
Persica()<Speaker>Persica</Speaker>||<黑点1>：...
()||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>：Half an hour later, Temporary Griffin Control in Area S02.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||：...So that's the deal, Commander.+File No. 7 won't be hard to find, but it's deep within enemy territory...and that's a whole different matter.+You'll need to parachute to somewere near the old S.F. factory.+I'll brief the AR Team on what they have to do. Your job is to keep them safe.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>：Are you ready, Commander? We're about to set off.+We are now in Area S02. Our objective is to infiltrate Base 0 and search for File No. 7.+Geographical data of the area has already been uploaded to my command system. Please take a look.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>10</BIN>：This IS deep within S.F. territory. Their defence is very tight.+But I'm sure the commander will have a way of making an opening for us?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>||：Don't be hasty, Commander.+S.F. has set up jamming devices in the area. Not to mention there's a risk of being infected with "Parapluie" if we set up a link with any Sangvis equipment.+RO's anti-jamming ability can keep the AR Team operating under normal parameters. To prevent infection, all connections with the Sangvis network will also be established by RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>：You just have to seize the external control center and create a diversion for the AR Team and I to enter Base 0 undetected.+That's our objective. We'll wait for your signal, Commander.
