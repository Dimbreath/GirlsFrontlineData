()||<BIN>240</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_wv_battle</BGM>:By the time Lee Enfield rushes to the scene, it's already in complete disarray.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Who the hell did this?!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:How should I know?! The comms are jammed... Say, is everyone okay?!
PK(0)<Speaker>PK</Speaker>||:Don't panic. Our leaders will be back soon!
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:I'm not scared... I'm not scared at all...
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Type 56-1!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Leader!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Get ahold of yourselves! Such panic is unsightly! +56-1, what exactly is the problem that you mentioned in...
()||:Lee Enfield enters the room and falls silent. +Her eyes are drawn immediately to MDR in the corner. +MDR is sitting there quietly as if she's asleep.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:How did this happen...?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...Who was the first to discover her?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I was.
()||:Gr G36c steps forward from the group.
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:I left the church and checked the surrounding rooms one by one. +When I got to this one, I noticed it was locked – it's the only room with a locked door. I thought whoever's behind this whole thing was in there, so I fired at the lock and broke in, only to find MDR collapsed over there.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Yeah, I was with Gr G36c. I can vouch for everything she said.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:The door was locked from the inside?
G36C(0)<Speaker>Gr G36c</Speaker>||:Ja.
()||:Lee Enfield walks toward the door. The lock has indeed been destroyed by a bullet. The mangled piece of metal is hanging like a broken rag doll on the wooden door. +She takes a look around – it's a rectangular room with no windows. All the walls are covered in wallpaper that shows no sign of damage.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Is this a so-called locked-room murder...?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:D-Don't scare us, Leader! I think a ghost did this!
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Isn't that even scarier of a thought...?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Miss Lee, Miss MDR's body bears no physical injury at all. This should be the result of an electronic assault.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +PK, Sten, and Gr G36c, you three head back to the church with MDR's body. +Tokarev, Type 56-1, and Papasha, you're with me. We're searching the mansion again.
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Haven't you already done that before?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:There's a thunderstorm out there. +Under such tumultuous weather conditions, even T-Dolls can't leave the scene. +So if the culprit arrived after us, they must still be within the mansion.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...Which means we must've missed something.
PK(0)<Speaker>PK</Speaker>||:Understood. +Are we staying behind as backup?
StenMK2(0)<Speaker>STEN MkII</Speaker>||:Why am I even in the backup group?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I'll get in touch with you once every hou- every half an hour to prevent another ambush from happening.
PK(0)<Speaker>PK</Speaker>||:Ambush? You believe MDR was ambushed?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:MDR is an outstanding T-Doll. If she'd caught sight of the culprit, she wouldn't have let herself be killed without putting up a fight. +If she hadn't even had the chance to fire a single shot, I'm inclined to think that the culprit dealt her a fatal blow from behind.
PK(0)<Speaker>PK</Speaker>||:I see. Your reasoning is sound.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But...what if...it really was a ghost? Even the most outstanding T-Doll wouldn't stand a chance!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:... +Ghosts don't exist in this world, Papasha.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Right, enough gloomy talk. We're splitting up, but we must take care not to be alone, so pair up. +Papasha, pull yourself together. This isn't like you at all. As a T-Doll, you mustn't let such fictitious nonsense get to you.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Eeep... Got it!
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Tokarev, please stay with me. +56-1, go in the other direction with Sten. We're doing a thorough sweep in every room – don't let even a single bug get pass you.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Roger that!
