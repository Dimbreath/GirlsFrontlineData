()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><SE1>AVG_door_elecport</SE1><Night>:...Inside the command center.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 obtains access and hurriedly downloads the data to reconstruct the paths of the base personnel in the morning.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Geez, getting this sure took a lot of effort... I'll have to brag a little the next time I see the Commander!+The culprit is really evil. I can't believe they tried to infect our entire base!+We might have ended up saving Griffin by doing this, don't you think, KSVK—
KSVK(0)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker><Shake>||:Ugh...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There is a soft thud from behind P7. KSVK is collapsed on the floor. Standing in the doorway is P90, holding her gun.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:W-W-Wha...?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Don't worry, it was just a karate chop.+You, on the other hand... What are you trying to accomplish by wrecking the alarm system, P7?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:P7 is about to repeat her explanation to P90 when she glances at the holographic model on the control terminal and notices...+—The indistinct form from the security footage earlier was P90.+P7 freezes in place while P90 approaches her with her gun drawn.
()||<BIN>212</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:P90 comes to a halt.
()<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:Oh? You're pointing your gun at me... What is the meaning of this?
()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:S-So it was you!+You were the one sneaking around and following me all afternoon!
()<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:...Following you? I have no idea what you're talking about.
()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Don't pretend! You must be the one infecting everyone, isn't that right?+I already checked the security footage! You were present in all the locations where the infection broke out this morning, so don't tell me it was a coincidence!
()<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:But it WAS a coincidence! H-How could I go around spreading a disease? You're sullying my good name!+And as for you, explain those weirdly colored spots on your hands!
()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I accidentally got some stuff on me and...
()<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||:So you're an infected Doll, P7. Wait, don't tell me...YOU'RE the source of the infection?+And now you've snuck into the command center to destroy the security footage evidence!
()<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Y-You're talking nonsense!+Hmph, I'm going to grab you and hand you over to the Commander!
()<Speaker>P90</Speaker>||<黑点1>:That's my line!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑点2><Night>:...Meanwhile.+In the S.F. base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Secret Special Search Team overcomes one obstacle after another and finally comes face to face with Alchemist.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Heh, what stubborn rats you are.+I won't lose to Griffin again... Torturing you will surely be more fun than torturing other Dolls.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Tch, don't get ahead of yourself.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:You're a pack of fools. To think you actually believe I'm the one spreading that disease...+Yet, If I were in control of my own destiny, that may not be the worst thing to do.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:I would advise you to abandon such villainous ideation as soon as possible.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:You know, you're so dumb that it's actually kind of adorable.+Do you understand how stupid you've been? +You fought your way here for something that could never happen to a Doll.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:What would Sangvis trash like you know about preserving precious friends' lives?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Is that what you think...+Hmph, if we S.F. Dolls didn't understand that, then you wouldn't have found your way here today, Griffin.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:...And what is that supposed to mean?
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Nothing in particular...+It's just that...neither of us have ever been willing to acknowledge the certain things we have in common.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...+There's no point in talking any further!+Let's go, Welrod! This day will go down in history as the anniversary date of her death!
