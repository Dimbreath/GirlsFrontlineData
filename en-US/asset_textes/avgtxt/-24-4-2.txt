()||<BIN>88</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2>:...SOP-II successfully enters the Griffin resupply point.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hehe, looks like my plan worked really well. +Helloooo, anyone there? +...Anybody? +In the end...I'm still alone, huh... +Where...did everyone go...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II inspects her surroundings.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:This place is a mess, but there are no signs of a fight. Could it have been an emergency withdrawal? +Still, the footprints are fresh, so they couldn't have gone too far. If I chase them now I might make it in time... +But I don't know where they ran to either. I should look in the warehouse just in case.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II runs up to the warehouse.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I wonder if my current body could get past the authentication? +(Pushes) ...Eh? +Hey! The door's not even closed!
SOPII(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II pokes her head inside and looks around.
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ah...it's empty after all. +They didn't leave anything behind. Now we've both been abandoned, RO, haha...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II looks down in dejection and stares at the ground. +...Then, she notices the footprints in the mud.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:These footprints... No... +Griffin doesn't have anything with four legs! +...Ah! Dinergates! Dinergates must have taken away all the stuff in here! +Which means...
SOPII(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...SOP-II starts organizing her thoughts.
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:S.F. must have looted this resupply point, but the Griffin forces must have run off ahead of time. +In that case, the most likely possibility is that... +All that stuff was taken to a nearby Sangvis resupply point, right? +Awww...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>40</BIN><黑点2>:...SOP-II brings up her electronic map.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:This sort of thing is too risky, even for me. +Dear RO635...the things I do for friendship.
