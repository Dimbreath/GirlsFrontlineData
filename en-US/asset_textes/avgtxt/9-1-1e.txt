RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Hey...SOP II.
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What's up?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Does the AR Team get into situations like this often?
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What do you mean?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：I mean right now... A situation where we've lost contact with HQ and are surrounded by hundreds of Sangvis troops in a run-down factory with only a single magazine of ammo left...
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Well...I was in a similar situation a year ago when I got split up with M4 and the others, though there weren't this many enemies...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：That is to say...it's even worse right now?
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Mmmm... I guess so?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Right...right...
RO635(3)<Speaker></Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：...RO suddenly stands up.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Yet you still opened fire on the enemy! SOP II! Didn't I say that we would sneak past that outpost!
RO635(5);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I don't think it would've been possible to sneak past them under those conditions.+Rather than waiting to be discovered by the enemy, why not take the initiative ourselves?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：I had already disguised our signals. Those low-level Sangvis troops wouldn't have been able to recognize us!
RO635(5);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Even if we were right in their face?+Wow...it's that awesome?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Of course it is... Wait, that's not the point! What I mean is that you should trust me. I'm the commander and I won't put us into unnecessary danger, understand?
RO635(5);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Alright, alright...+But that's pretty awesome, is it new technology from 16Lab?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Heh, what's even better is that I can scan the number of enemies behind me while running right now.
RO635(5);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：But we're not running right now...
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：That's why I said "now"! Run, they're going to surround us!+Want to guess how many Sangvis troops are on our tail, you little troublemaker?!
RO635(5);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Lemme see... A little over a hundred?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||<黑屏1>：Stop looking and run!+Aaaaah! Help us, Commander! Hurry and locate our position already!
