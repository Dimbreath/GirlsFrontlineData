()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BIN>267</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>GF_xGS2_36</BGM>:Is there no end to these bastards?
()||:A mound of corpses have grown before us as our surroundings slowly disintegrate. +I'm guessing every single Five Republics terrorist in the nuclear plant is running towards us.
()||:There are only three of them left, but they're high on blood lust and fully aware of the fact that we're almost out of ammo. They charge at us without a second thought. +I've run out of rounds for the assault rifle so I'm only left with my pistol. +But just as one of the enemies is almost right in front of me, I hear the dreaded "click" from the gun.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Dammit! Not this one too!
()||:I try to duck back behind cover, but my wounds are slowing me down. I can only watch with wide eyes as he aims his weapon at my chest—
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<震屏3>:<size=60>Signore Giuseppe!</size>
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:At the last second, Henrietta jumps in front of me. +The terrorist's gun barrel flashes and a bullet hits Henrietta in the chest, but not before she throws her knife. +The knife pierces through his helmet and embeds itself in his head. +The impact from the shot sends Henrietta hurtling into me, while the remaining two soldiers also come charging in. +Time seems to slow down all of a sudden. I drop my own useless gun and draw the pistol in Henrietta's holster. I recognize it – it's the SIG P239 that Giuseppe gave her when they first met. +I point the pistol at the last two standing Five Republics soldiers, who are also aiming at us.
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:...
()||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Gunshots.
()||:I crash onto the floor with Henrietta on top of me. +The two Five Republics soldiers also collapse before us after being shot in the head. +That's the last of the enemies. I let out a long sigh.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:My aim was pretty good. Looks like my regular training hasn't gone to waste.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_16</BGM>:Signore Giuseppe!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm fine. Are you okay?
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I...I'm fine too. It didn't get through my armor.
()||:Henrietta climbs off me and shows me the two warped casings hammered into her bulletproof vest. 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Phew... That's a relief...
()||:I strain to get up on my feet. Henrietta stands with her back to me, silently taking in the scene of devastation. +There are bodies of Five Republics terrorists everywhere. All the blood has dyed the floor crimson. +The smell of gun smoke fills the air. Henrietta's shoulders are shivering. 
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I've fought here thousands of times. At last...
()||:I hear a sob. +I reach out but hesitate to touch her.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Have we won?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...Yes, we have.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So let's get out of here.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I want to rest my hand on her shoulder to console her, but she suddenly turns around and backs away while aiming her weapon at me.
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>GF_xGS2_11</BGM><BIN>261</BIN>:No, I'm not leaving with you. +Don't come any closer, or I'll shoot.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Why?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:You should know.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We've won. +So why do you want to shoot me again like you did back then?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I'm not shooting you "again"... +Because...you aren't even Signore Giuseppe.
()||:I flinch, but I instantly understand what is happening.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +So you noticed...
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe couldn't fight that well... +He wouldn't forget about Cyborgs, Handlers, and most of all, the oath and bond between a Fratello. +Of course you wouldn't remember anything. You never knew us in the first place. +You were just posing as a Handler.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... +Is that why you have to shoot me? +Because I deceived you?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:No...I can never shoot you... +Thanks to you, I realized that you aren't really Signore Giuseppe, and I am not really Henrietta. +Everyone here is a simulation. Even the feelings deep down in my heart are fake...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What is going on?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Kalin?</color>
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Authorizations have been transferred. You can now come out safely.</color>
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, while we were obtaining the authorizations from Henrietta, she also reverse-engineered our program and hacked us.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Our engineer has already patched up the loophole, but she might have already accessed some of our files...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...I see. +Henrietta, you've figured out the truth from our database, haven't you?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:All of us are just simulations created based on memories, so of course Signore Giuseppe wouldn't be coming back. +But...that's fine, I have no more regrets. +Even if I can't see him again... Even if I can't keep watching over this garden... +At least I finally emerged victorious in a place where I had suffered defeat after defeat. Isn't that good enough? +Claes was right – everything has its time. This is an ending that befits a good story. +You probably know that I've kept the truth from the others. Now that you've already found your own Fratello... +This place won't last much longer. No matter who you are, I would like to thank you for granting my wish before the end.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:No...it isn't over yet. +You must be aware of what we're planning to do. A new life awaits you.
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yes, I am aware. I hope you will take good care of my friends, but I have no right to go with them.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What makes you think so?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Without Signore Giuseppe, without my Handler, I am no longer needed as a Cyborg. +History has repeated itself too many times; I'm just...tired of it all... +So...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Please go. Thank you for checking in on me as Signore Giuseppe, and thank you for making my final wish come true.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But what about you?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:This space is about to disappear. If I stay, I think I'll just disappear along with it.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
()||:I step forward with determination and try to grip Henrietta by the arm.
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Please don't come any closer.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Or what, are you going to shoot me?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:...Please leave me alone. You have nothing to do with me, right? +You aren't my Handler; you aren't Signore Giuseppe...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:And I can't care about you just because I'm not him? +I'm not seeing a Cyborg. All I see is a girl who needs help.
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I am NOT a girl! +I am a Cyborg! A machine! A killer! +There's nothing left for me in a world without Signore Giuseppe!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But you still have to carry on, even if you must shoulder the painful memory of a deceased man. +Giuseppe wouldn't have wanted to see you disappear in this space. 
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:If I were really Henrietta...you might be right. +But I'm not. I'm just a bunch of data. +I'm a ghost shackled by my nightmares! Why must I live?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is that what you think...?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yes... +I will be grateful to you for as long as I live. +But...please go.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Then I suppose you don't want this gun back?
()<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><白屏1>:!!
()||<BIN>267</BIN><BGM>GF_xGS2_16</BGM><白屏2>:Henrietta subconsciously reaches out for the pistol in my hand. +But I take a step back and draw her onto ground that's yet to vanish.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I thought you said there's nothing left for you in this world?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The fact that you instinctively reacted to this gun makes me think that even though your memories are artificial, they are anything but false. +If you still deny your own identity, I guess I can just throw the gun away?
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Wait...stop!!
()||:I back away step by step, and Henrietta follows me to the center of the remaining space. +I stop; she also comes to a halt. +She's just two paces away, but she seems a bit hesitant, so I make the decision for her. 
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Here, take it. It's precious to you, isn't it?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Yeah...
()||:I hold the pistol out. She drops the weapon she's been using and takes back her cherished pistol from my hand...
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Signore Giuseppe...
()||:She hugs the Sig Sauer to her chest as the tears finally overflow and stream uncontrollably down her face. +That man will never return. No amount of yearning will change that fact. +She bites her lip to stop herself from crying, but a heart-wrenching sob still escapes her.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander... This space is almost completely gone. If you don't leave now...</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just a little longer... Give us another minute...</color>
()||:Henrietta weeps softly. I hesitate for a second and finally reach out to pat her gently on the head. +She looks down at the gun in her hand. Drops of tears splash on its surface.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:What should I do...
()||:I don't answer. I know she isn't asking for my opinion. +I simply retract my arm and stand there silently, waiting for her. +After a while, Henrietta finally lifts her head and looks me in the eye.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:If I may ask, who are you?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm a Commander at Griffin.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Then Griffin Commander, what do you think I should do?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:The dead are in the past, while the living should live on in the present. +There's no need to dwell on who you are. Even if you aren't a Cyborg or the old Henrietta, you still deserve to live. Live, no matter what it takes, no matter what awaits you in the end.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:But who will that make me? +If I can't live as Henrietta or even a Cyborg, what would be my purpose?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:You give yourself purpose simply by living. +I believe that the man who created this space did not want you to be forgotten. +He constructed this place to keep your stories alive and pass on the beacon of hope. +No matter what happened in the past, you are you. The battles you fought are now history, and you deserve a life happier than you've ever known. +Even if you no longer have to fight, even if you no longer have to bear the pain you've always borne, even if your old self is dead, Henrietta is Henrietta.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:... +Henrietta is Henrietta...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Henrietta's story will be yours to write from now on. +You once said you didn't want to be forgotten, right? +You may not be who Henrietta used to be, but you have inherited everything that made her Henrietta. +You are the embodiment of both her past and her future. +Or are you going to reject it all? Are you really fine with being forgotten?
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:No...I don't want to be forgotten...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Everyone wants to be remembered, even the deceased. +So long as you live, even if just for their sake, their stories won't be forgotten, and that's why you must live. +The world may not have become a better place, but as long as there are people like them, there is hope. +These memories that belong to you shouldn't just fade into oblivion.
Henrietta(3)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:I...I don't want them to be forgotten either! +Not Signore Giuseppe...nor the others at the Agency!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now that's better.
Henrietta(4)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Huh?!
()||:I give Henrietta's dainty cheek a pinch. +I can't help but chuckle at how surprised she looks.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:When this is over, I'd like you to tell me all about those people. +So...come with me and leave this place behind. Your friends are waiting for you.
Henrietta(2)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Okay...I will tell you everything, again and again, so that you'll never forget.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'd like that. +Then it's time to go home.
Henrietta(1)<Speaker>Henrietta</Speaker>||:Right.
()||<白屏1>:Henrietta turns around. The turbine hall is all but gone. +The place where lives have been snuffed out countless times has become a void, just like that. +As everything in the past fades away, a new life will surely begin. +...Goodbye, Vita. Goodbye, my past.
