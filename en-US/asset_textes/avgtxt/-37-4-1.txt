MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:MDR is an exemplary T-Doll. She wouldn't have disappeared without a word.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:So what do we do now?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Search the whole mansion. We have to find MDR's whereabouts.

MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:...I'm really sorry about this. My team is causing you trouble.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Nyet, you don't have to apologize. This is something beyond your control. +So, should we join the search as well?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Yes, of course. +I think I might have an idea.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:An idea?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Since 56-1 had come across the electrical room earlier, it didn't take us much time to get to it. +MDR had only that amount of time to leave the church, so it can be surmised that she couldn't have gone too far. +If she had been attacked, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that it occurred somewhere near the church.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I see. Such reasoning is full of clarity. You truly live up to your name, Miss Lee. +Then let's hurry up and find her.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:We don't have to rush. +Visibility was extremely limited in this pitch dark mansion before we restored the power supply. MDR doesn't have night vision equipment with her. +Which means she'd have left traces along the way. +We'll be able to find her by following those traces.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I see your point... Keen observations and an agile mind. +You're just like a certain famous detective, Miss Lee. He also happened to be British. What's his name... Sher...?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Sherlock Holmes. +Please don't make fun of me, Tokarev. This is all just simple inductive reasoning.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:I'm not making fun of you. I'm just genuinely impressed. +Your presence really is reassuring. While I wasn't aware of your involvement beforehand, I now find myself glad for it.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:Speaking of which, I've been wondering, Tokarev... +When did you arrive at the mansion?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Not long ago. We'd only just got here when we ran into your team. +We entered through the garden in the back.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I see. We came in through the front door at 8pm. No wonder we didn't see each other.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:8pm... That's around the time I received my orders.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I find it really strange – questionable even – that the Commander sent you in without telling you anything or waiting for my report.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:True, the Commander almost never gives such confusing orders. +We've also been kept completely clueless about the situation in the mansion. Have you discovered anything extraordinary, Miss Lee?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:All too many. +It's most disconcerting when you find yourself up against something so full of openings. +The most obvious would be the bizarre church. You've seen it, right?
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Da...the one bang in the center of the mansion, you mean? +Those wedding gowns sure are gorgeous. +I bet you'll look stunning in one of them.
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:They're gorgeous, yes, but also glaringly suspicious. +Whether it's the works of ghosts or living people, we're very much being mocked.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:Indeed... Do you believe in ghosts, Miss Lee?
MLEMK1(0)<Speaker>Lee Enfield</Speaker>||:I don't. +Malice is malice, be it from humans or ghosts. Our enemy is simply malice and evil in the collective sense.
TT33(0)<Speaker>Tokarev</Speaker>||:How profound. I hope I could be as single-minded and straightforward as you.
