()||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:The time is 22:30, in the enemies' outpost in the sewers...
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker><通讯框>||:Didn't think I'd have to come save your butts so soon... +Figured I could slack off for several minutes since it's you folks...
Mk46(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sorry for making you work overtime, but the mission isn't over yet. +We've already tracked down the last-known location of our target's signal, so please make for the coordinates I just indicated before regrouping with us.
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Are you sure you want me to go there? My order is to get you out.
Mk46(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:The Commander has approved of my proposal. +Sorry, the next part of the mission is going to be highly dangerous, so it'd be great if you can coordinate with the HOC and have them within range.
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:Sure... I just saw the approval notification. The Commander sure does trust you.
Mk46(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I hope you can trust me, too.
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:What else can I do? I'm here anyway. I'd rather tidy up after you instead of SAW. +So what do we do next?
Mk46(0);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:As our escape route has been altered, we'll have to re-enter the sewers halfway through the secret passage. +We're bound to run into the white enemies, but we must try our best to avoid an extended fight. The snappier we move the better.
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>||:Roger that. My team will do what we can to suppress the enemies and stop them from pinning you down.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:After that, once we enter the sections with the floodgates, I'll try to hack their control panels and lock the enemies out on the other side. +However, I have to remain stationary while controlling the gates so please watch my back. 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? You're gonna engage in electronic warfare in the middle of the operation? +If you screw up the controls and lock us and the HOC out with the white enemies, we'll be finished!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Trust me. I've studied the structure at length. I can do it.
