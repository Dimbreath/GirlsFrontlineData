Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Alright, everyone, you did well. We nearly made mistakes several times, but good thing SOP-II kept us on track through the comms link. +Now we just need to wait for her to come back—
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You guys are slow.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<震屏>:Eh?! SOP-II, you actually—!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:O-Oi! D-Don't hug my legs again! + I was alone, so I circled around the Military by myself and came back straight away. +Did you encounter any Sangvis units?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Yeah, we met a few, but we let them off in the end. +After all, the Military's targeting them, so letting them go would be safer for us.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Haha! You learn fast!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Rather, I can't believe you actually thought of a tactic like that.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Hehe, I didn't come up with it - I found it. +That's a secret tactic from the Griffin database that the Commander practiced once, and it just so happened to be perfect for this situation, so I wanted to try it out. +I didn't think it'd actually work! You guys were great!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Frankly, we were all scared to death too, but everyone did as they were told and we all made it through safely. +But now isn't the time to relax. Let's start planning our next move.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah. After all, I still have no idea what route we should take. In any case, we should think of a way to get to the Griffin base. +Have you been keeping an eye on the Military's movements? What are they like?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:We're safe for now. The enemy's slowed down; they seem to be rescanning their maps.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...Scanning their maps?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:The Commander fought the Military here some time ago, and the Military units had to prioritize saving their nearby human comrades. +They needed time to rescan the signals in this area, which is the only reason why we're still alive.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That's true... The Military has a lot of humans within their ranks. +Still, I didn't know they'd save their friends.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:They're human; humans are way more valuable than we are.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Haha, I know. After all, once they're broken, they can't be fixed.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Have you attacked humans before, SOP-II?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No, why do you ask?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:We're worried that we won't be able to attack humans if we run into them, considering we don't have orders or permission to do so from Griffin. +Frankly speaking, I don't want to do that either. The humans made us and gave us a lot of nice things, so I'm thinking we shouldn't...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We should avoid them as much as possible. +They nearly killed me once. I won't be so lucky next time.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:But what if... +What should we do? I think everyone ought to know, so we should come up with sensible emergency measures that we can take.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:... +If it ever comes down to that, let me do the shooting. I'm not bound by Griffin's pointless restrictions. +To me, the only difference between the humans who want to harm us and Sangvis Ferri is that we can't tear parts out of the former's corpses.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:(Chuckles) We don't tear parts out of S.F. corpses either. Only you do that.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And I like it. Persica must have put some really weird things into my neural cloud without mentioning them...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:I know exactly what you mean. It's just like how I enjoy collecting cigarette packs!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cigarette packets?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Yep! I've liked collecting cigarette packs for as long as I could remember. +I don't just enjoy it; it's almost like a compulsion. Whenever I see a cigarette pack I've never seen before, I have to have it.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Do you smoke?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:No! Of course not. It's dangerous for a Doll to smoke, right? +But I just like collecting cigarette packs. Seeing them all neatly lined up makes me happy. +I can't think of any specific reason why that's the case either. Maybe it was a personality preset from when I was rolled out.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Oh... it's just like FF FNC, she eats chocolate for no reason at all... +Even when Dolls don't need to eat human food to sustain themselves...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:In truth... It used to trouble me. +Humans would make fun of my hobby and bully me for it back when I was working in the civilian sector. +I even started to hate that hobby of mine. I hated that I liked this sort of thing...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And you just... sat there and took it?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:I wasn't authorized to defy human beings, so...there was nothing I could do... +At that time, I even wanted to burn my entire collection...even though I knew it wouldn't help things at all, because presets...were presets. +But around that time, Griffin started buying up large numbers of Dolls on the market, and my owner found that my neural cloud and ability test results met their selection criteria surprisingly well, and then—
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:And now we're running for our lives on this crappy battlefield.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:(Laughs) At least, having met you, I don't think I'm so weird anymore. After all, your hobbies are way weirder than mine in comparison!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:That's mean! I just like what I like! +Besides, that "hobby" greatly improves my combat efficiency!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Well, you're from the AR Team, trump cards made to accomplish Griffin's most important missions. I'm sure you don't have weird, pointless "hobbies" added onto you by your creators, like us. +Frankly speaking, I'm a little jealous...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Jealous? I don't think it's anything particularly good...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Well, it's because you were chosen, you get special treatment, unlike us regular Dolls... +In a way, you're quite... fortunate? Don't you think so?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...I don't know. While I like ripping S.F. to bits, don't most Dolls consider moving supply crates around in safety every day to be the best kind of life?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Moving supply crates, huh? When I used to carry out logistics duties, I used to think they were dull and repetitive. Thinking back on those days now, they just seem so happy...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Haha, well, once we get back to Griffin, you can go back to your happy days of moving supply crates again!
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Yeah... although that'll have to wait till we get back to the Griffin command post. +But... that assumes that there will still be people there waiting for us...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well, all we can do now is follow that plan. +Speaking of which, Cx4, is the area ahead where the former command post used to be?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Yeah, we're almost there. +But the thing is, there are a lot of Sangvis outposts ahead, and finding a suitable route to take us past them without incident won't be easy.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Well, there's no turning back, so I'll go up ahead and scout.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:No, let me do it, it'll be safer that way. In case...
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cx4, this isn't—
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Beep, beep, beep.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:Huh? It's a comms signal from this area. Who could it be?
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It can't possibly be the Commander. Cx4, have everyone slow their pace and put them on alert.
()||:...SOP-II puts the transmission through.
BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:M4 SOPMOD II.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Huh? +Scare...crow?
