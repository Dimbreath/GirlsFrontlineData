()||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Squad 404 takes the repeater station.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:45, we're ready to begin.
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Mm, I'm connecting now. +You guys just keep an eye on the surroundings.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:45... are you planning to hack the SF network? +Don't forget that Parapluie is spreading throughout this sector.
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:I'm not the sort of Doll to be rewritten so easily.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:That's right, it's times like these where 45 can show how great she is.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Hmph... +And what if you miscalculate?
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Then you can have your wish and personally finish me off.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:...I'm looking forward to that.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点1>:I'll leave forward recon to you. I need to focus on searching for treasures.
()||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点2>:...3 minutes later.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Will we go back soon? It's not good to hang around too long in places like these...
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:I see the objective! +Hang on...everyone hold on a bit... +Those Dolls up ahead look like bad news...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Tch, military Dolls.  +...They must be under the control of the Parapluie virus. +Still, given the guard around here is so heavy, we must have the right address.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:This is really bad. What should we do?
G11(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:We're talking about UMP45, whose personality contains less than 5% kindness. +Do you honestly expect her to go "Let's abandon the mission for the sake of everyone's safety" or something like that?
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;HK416(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:W-what? +So we're going to fight those tin cans...
G11(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:That's right, Gr G11.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Ehhhhh?!
G11(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:I've pinpointed the location of the Sangvis central database. Let's move out now.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Uuu... I don't wanna...  +Just looking at them scares me, can I stay here and sleep...
G11(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Well, it's not like we can't leave you here. After all... laying bait is a good tactic.
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Uuu...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN><黑屏1>:If you don't like it, you'd better be on top form, Gr G11. +Otherwise, you might really die this time.
