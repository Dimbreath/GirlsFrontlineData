()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><Night>:...In the S.F. base.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:(Panting)... I guess...this dummy body just isn't good enough, huh?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kneeling on the ground, Spitfire has the muzzle of her gun pointed between Alchemist's eyes. +Alchemist's platinum hair is a mess, but she's still smiling as smugly as when she was standing in front of the bunker.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Now then...it's over you.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep—!
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Ahem... Uh, I have an emergency announcement to make!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>46</BIN><黑屏2><Night>:...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as Spitfire's finger is about to reach the break pressure of her gun's trigger, the call that suddenly comes through startles all the Dolls present.+The image that appears shows P90 carrying P7 like a kitten.
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>The transmission should have gotten through, right? Then I'll let you explain everything, P7—</color>
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Put me down first!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>(Cough)... In short, this disease thing, uhm...it was all a misunderstanding!</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Dolls in the S.F. base freeze for a moment. Spitfire then lowers her gun and exchanges a blank look with Welrod.+Alchemist, on the other hand, can no longer contain herself and laughs out loud.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So, um, this morning, I had my Dinergates steal one of Miss Kalin's makeup kits so I could draw some spots on Super SASS's body and make her look like a zombie...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I'll have you know my plan was perfect! I learned several days in advance that Miss Kalin would be out today, and that she'd put on makeup prior to leaving!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>As it turned out, the heavens were on my side, because she left that makeup kit with its ridiculous colors sitting right there on her table, although I still could have gotten it even if she did lock it inside her cabinet!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>And then, I mobilized my Dinergate army to go smear the makeup inside Super SASS's clothes and face towel while she wasn't looking! I thought that even if it doesn't get on her body, it'd get on her face, at least! Man, it was really scary. I almost ran into TAC-50!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But how was I supposed to know that SASS wouldn't wear her normal outfit today, but her Halloween costume! She actually dressed up so well for a mission yet she wouldn't even wash her face! Hmph!</color>
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Get to the point, P7!
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Okay, okay, I'm getting there!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The point is I was totally disappointed that Super SASS went out for a mission and I accidentally rubbed against the makeup and I couldn't wash it off so I threw the kit away—</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang! Spitfire shoots at the ground.+P7 shrinks away on the hologram display and P90 takes the communicator.
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uh, I think I'll explain the rest...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90 takes a deep breath. 
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So I saw P7 giving her Dinergates the orders, but I didn't see what happened with SASS...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>So, um, later on while I was on sentry duty, I got so bored that when I was changing posts, I copied what P7 was doing and had some drones pick up the makeup kit and gave the same orders to the drones...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I have to say, P7 really messed up the makeup kit, so I tried to sort it out in a corner somewhere. I finished writing up the order after a lot of work and had the drones carry bits of makeup.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I even mapped out their routes! That would allow the drones to cover the entire base, and if they spotted a target they would swoop down to scatter makeup on them! Hehe, I'm sure P7 could never have thought of such a cunning plan—</color>
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:And. Then?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>A-A-A-And then! And then I ended up with Welrod, and because I started copying Welrod, I...I forgot about those drones...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90's voice trails off, and her eyes seem to be unfocused and darting around.+The only sound in the S.F. base, apart from Alchemist's exhausted laughter, is the quiet electrical hum of their communicators.+Welrod and Spitfire look at each other, suddenly unsure of what to say.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:In other words...there is no epidemic in the base, big sis 75 isn't sick, and all of this happened because of...Miss Kalin's makeup?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><size=30>Yes...that's correct...</size></color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P90's voice is barely audible.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:...P7, P90... You two...
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uuu... We're sorry... Big sis Spitfire, I can hear you cracking your knuckles from over there...</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Silence washes over the S.F. base once again. At this point, even Alchemist has shut up to listen with a look of interest on her face.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><size=30>P90, didn't you say it would be safer if we came clean...</size></color>
P7(2);P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><size=30>You went into way too much detail...</size></color>
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><通讯框>;P90(0)||:<color=#00CCFF><size=30>I thought our punishment would be lighter that way...</size></color>
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF><size=30>I didn't expect Spitfire to get this angry...</size></color>
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<SE1>Select</SE1>:...Do the two of you really think I can't see what you're saying just because you reduced your font size?
P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We're sorry we're sorry we're really really sorry...!</color>
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Well, since that's the end of your ridiculous antics, perhaps it's time for me to take my leave—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>ClothingUp</SE1>:Welrod pins Alchemist down as she tries to get up.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Although it is true that Alchemist is innocent regarding this incident...+Her name is still "Alchemist", and there is no telling what other kind of contagion she could spread next time.+Shall we...take her alive back to the base for research?
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:I have no problem with that.
Spitfire(2);P90(0)<Speaker>P90</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not opposed to it...</color>
Spitfire(2);P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker<通讯框>>||:<color=#00CCFF>Research? Sure, sure—</color>
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:However, when we get back...I want to make a condition for the both of you, P7, P90.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+Halloween. Late at night.+Inside the Griffin base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:A thread on the message board has gotten a massive surge of replies in a short period of time. Unsurprisingly, the thread is created by MDR.
()<Speaker>MDR</Speaker>||<白屏1>:<color=#CA8EFF>"Hehe, come see the exclusive pictures personally taken by everyone's favorite, MDR! I got this shot by accident while I was sending my drones out to collect intel in the evening. Remember to comment, subscribe, and smash that like button!"</color>+<color=#CA8EFF>"Did something happen between them this Halloween? MDR will investigate in person after this! Ahhh stop cutting in between my posts—"</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>211</BIN><白屏2>:...+The slightly blurry picture in the post depicts five distinct smiling faces.+—Of course, Alchemist is still wearing her usual mocking smile, which somewhat annoys Spitfire who's beside her, but it only serves to make MDR's post that much more popular.
()<Speaker>Just A Hero Passing By</Speaker>||:"I'm so moved by the Secret Special Search Team. They protected the people important to them..."
()<Speaker>Cola is the Strongest</Speaker>||:"P7 is such a dork, she messed up right from the start with her dumb prank ahahaha"
()<Speaker>Do Dolls Eat Electric Pig?</Speaker>||:"To think they'd cause such a big fiasco! I almost thought I wouldn't be able to make it until sifu comes back from her mission..."
()<Speaker>Miss Tarot</Speaker>||:"Huh, I wonder what we can do with Alchemist. It would be nice if she could help me with my fortune-telling..."
()<Speaker>Low-key Fairy King</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:"Hehe, an alchemist, huh? Alchemist is perfect! Just the one I need to enrich my vaults—"
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:...Midnight.+In the secret room of the command center.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is anybody out there? Will someone PLEASE let me out? It's past midnight already! It isn't even Halloween anymore!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>This secret room really lives up to its name, hehe... You can scream until you go hoarse but nobody will hear you.</color>
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You speak like you own the place.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Because today was very amusing! And besides, nobody's come to lock me back up. Ah, freedom is bliss—</color>
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So you're not disappointed?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hm? I have no idea what you're talking about.</color>
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You must feel upset that you didn't achieve your objective, right?
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hehe, I don't really hold grudges... And besides, it's fun to play around like this from time to time.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You, on the other hand, will probably have to wait until the celebration is over before someone remembers that you're locked up in here.</color>
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Damn...how troublesome it is to not have comms access...+Hey, tell you what, get someone to come rescue me. I'll make sure to have Kalina pay you back after I get out!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Heehee...in that case, you'll owe me one, Commander of Griffin♪</color>
