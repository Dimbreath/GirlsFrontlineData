Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:It doesn't matter, I'm just glad someone was willing to help us!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Alright, alright. +If you're the team leader, can you contact a Griffin commander? Any of them would do.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:I'm very sorry... the battlefield is in a mess now, and there's disruption sources nearby, so all our comms with HQ have been cut off. +Our echelon's been getting by through syncing up with the Zener Protocol... but compared to having the Commander here in person, our efficiency is... +Speaking of which, you said you didn't have a command module, SOP-II?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No...but I've picked up a thing or two about tactics. +M4A1's past tactical plans and some of the Commander's mission records are saved in my neural cloud. Maybe we could refer to them when coming up with a battle plan...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:That's wonderful! +In the past, all we did was run logistics missions, and we're completely clueless as to what to do without a commander.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:So...can we count on you for leadership?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<震屏>:Eh?! But I've never been a leader before! Besides, aren't YOU the team leader?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:Technically speaking, yes...but I've got no experience, and I can't fight like you... +If you think about it, I'd probably end up leading everyone to an early grave, like just now...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:(Sighs) Alright then. I can't guarantee that I'll do a good job. After all, my neural cloud's computation capabilities aren't nearly as good as M4's and the others. +In that case, you'd best stay close to me, everyone. Without a command module I can't give orders via command access, so I'll sync our data up with the Zener Protocol. Just take action based on the data you get from me. +Still, you'd best prepare yourselves for this. Relaying messages this way is a lot more inefficient than giving direct orders. Our response time is going to be about half a beat behind S.F....
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:No problem! Everyone trusts you! Our response times were slow to begin with anyway!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You don't need to state that sort of thing so proudly...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:Well, at least we've solved the problem of leadership. +But we're too few in number. We can't even form a defensive line.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Why didn't you retreat earlier?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:Our mission was to rescue our trapped friends, then retreat to a Griffin base. +However, we lost contact with our commander just after we arrived. +S.F. attacked us, and we had no choice but to abandon the resupply point and run, but instead we ended up being surrounded and bottled up here... +If we could save our friends while S.F. is reorganizing their formation, we might be able to salvage our defensive line...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Do you know where the trapped Dolls are?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Yep! I'll mark their coordinates on your electronic map, SOP-II!
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:So these places, then? +I'm...not too sure if I can do this...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:SOP-II?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Sorry...this is my first time taking the lead like this. +In a situation like this, I don't know...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:That's fine. I'm honored to be fighting by your side. +If this turns out to be my last battle, then nothing would suit me better.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? You guys...you can't back up your neural clouds?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:It seems...something unexpected happened at Griffin HQ. +We haven't been able to upload our neural cloud backups since before we met you. +So this might be the only chance we have.
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You guys... +Then...are you really prepared for this?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:(Laughs) Frankly speaking, we're not... +But this might be a good thing too, the feeling of actually being remembered by someone, instead of being nothing but a set of cold, duplicated data...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cx4...what does it feel like to be remembered?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:It may sound kind of strange, but at times... +I wonder if the fact that a Doll can't die is a bad thing after all... +It's like...a curse...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:A curse?
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:As a logistics Doll, I often escort the operation teams into combat, and then see their bodies dragged back... +And while they appear before me the next day, good as new, they also...forget a lot of things... +Have you ever felt that way, SOP-II?
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm sorry... I can't backup my neural cloud, so I can't quite relate...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:I...I probably don't experience such feelings very often...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||<BIN>40</BIN><黑屏2>:There's no need to apologize, SOP-II! I'm not complaining about the fact that I was manufactured, but sometimes I can't help but wonder... What are we? +If the only thing that proves who I am is a chain of memories, then what about the next me? Is it just a Doll of the same model, or is she "me"? +Maybe if I couldn't back myself up, I wouldn't feel so confused...
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cx4...
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker><Shake>;SOPIIDamage(2)||:Oh...sorry, I went and got all sentimental! +In any case, we're going to take good care of our bodies and everyone else's, so we need to try our best to save everyone! 
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Cx4...you can't just try, you know.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;SOPIIDamage(0)||:Huh?
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What I mean is, you HAVE to do it!
Cx4Storm(0);SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:While I didn't understand most of what you just said, I think the rough idea is that we're all the same now! +That definitely feels a bit more familiar to me, so that's all the motivation I needed! +Come on, let's go and save everyone!
