NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：So, where do we start?+Why don't we start from...that unlucky Lyco?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：......+I'm regretful for what happened to Lyco.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：No no, there's no need for regret. This is fate, a mission handed to him by God. It just so happened that he was the unlucky fellow who took the fall.+Carter should've mentioned that he wanted something, right? Something called..."Elisa"?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：...The AI that's been commanding Sangvis Ferri to fight against us.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Elisa. What a nice name. But is she really that important? So important that the military has to make such a big hubbub out of dealing with her?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：This is to pave the way for the future of Doll technology. The military needs to obtain better Doll technology as a contingency for the future.
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Hahahaha! Oh my...Mr. Kryuger...+Do you really believe the crap that Carter spews out of his mouth? I work in the Doll industry and can tell you that a self-operating AI is no better than the thousand-strong force of my company.+Not to mention, they're merely Dolls... Why would those wily old foxes baptized by war even care about mere infantry support equipment in this day and age? 
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：You mean...
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：What network does Sangvis Ferri use? What was Elisa's design based on?
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：OGAS...? You mean Carter wants that OGAS System? Wasn't it abandoned in the 80s?
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Now you're getting on track. Luckily we're not under the rule of those silly leaders from the 80s anymore, otherwise we'd all be digging for potatoes in Siberia.+What I can tell you is that this thing was not unearthed from any good place. It...used to be the place that everyone paid attention to.
NPC-Kyruger(0)<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||：......
NPC-Kyruger(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：I would say that this thing might not be what Carter himself wants, Mr. Kryuger.+Carter is merely an insignificant cog in the machine. As for the true mastermind behind this plot... Hehehe...+I'm sure you're aware that a nation-transcending alliance is slowly forming.+Yet, there always exist certain conservative forces that wish to prevent such monumental inceptions. The victor tends to be the side with the most power.
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>：...Havier scoots over to Kryuger's side.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Mr. Kryuger, the reason I came here today is to give you a piece of advice. Don't be the small bird caught in the midst of a storm.+The storm will tear apart everything in its path, regardless of whether that small bird intended to be there or not.
()||：...Havier gets up and prepares to leave.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：If I were to lose a big customer like you, I wouldn't know how to face the board of directors. I'd still like to build up my retirement nest egg, you know.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：......
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>79</BIN>：...Just then, the door opens.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Apologies for the wait. The issue has been... Havier!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>：(Glances at Kryuger) See, I was right. Five minutes.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：I knew it was you! No one else would do such a thing!+Havier, how dare you shame me on such an occasion!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Oh my, General Carter, whatever could you be referring to? As an esteemed officer, I think you ought to be more prudent in your speech.
NPC-Carter(0)<Speaker>Carter</Speaker>||：Get out of my sight right this instant, or I'll break your other leg with that walking stick of yours!
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：Fine, fine. You're the big shot General. I'll leave now.
()||：...Havier presses up to Kryuger's ear.
哈维尔()<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||：All I did was hire some people to deflate all the guests' car tires. Oh, except yours. Hehehe...
()||：...Havier gets up and prepares to leave.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Oh, and Mister Commander over there, you seem like a promising person. We'll most likely meet again in the near future.+Well then, everyone, I bid you farewell.
