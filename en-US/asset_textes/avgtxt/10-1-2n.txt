g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:I knew it. Of course we'd run right into S.F. since we charged in so carelessly...
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:We killed them all so no big deal!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:I killed 90% of them, okay...
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Shush... Keep quiet and stay here.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Hmm? What is it?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:MP41 creeps toward a bush.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Found you! +98—
()||:An arm suddenly emerges and drags MP41 right into the bush.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<黑点1>:MP41! +Oh no, where did she go?!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑点2>:Don't shoot, don't shoot! It's me, MP41!
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I know. +How did you find me?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Uh...um...well... +First of all, we're on a highland with lots of tall trees and shrubbery around, which offers both a good vantage point and effective concealment. +Then I suddenly lost track of you so I guessed you might be conducting surveillance in this area?
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:You don't seem...as foolish as I originally thought.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Well... +So you think I'm stupid, Big Sis 98?!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Enough of that. +...Think of something else to call me first.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:You don't like it? Fine... Let me think...
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Just call me Kar.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Just Kar? That doesn't sound very polite... +I'll call you Fräulein Kar!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...Alright. +Why have you followed me here?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Because you're obviously after the Sangvis ringleader? +Bring me along, Fräulein Kar! I'll definitely make myself useful!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:...B-besides, if you're trying to fish for credit just because you took a stroll out here... +I'll have to expose you for the future of Griffin. +However...if you're really as capable as you claim to be, then I'd very much like to witness it with my own eyes! +I'll even vouch for you later on so no one would ever doubt you!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:In a certain sense, you've made quite an interesting point. +I am, in fact, on a mission and this is one of my hideouts for monitoring Sangvis movements.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:It does make for a fantastic surveillance spot... +B-but I haven't seen any Sangvis activity nearby at all?
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:As you said yourself, S.F. only deployed a single ringleader, who's most certainly doing everything she can to remain undetected. +Stay here and be my spotter while I head to my sniping position and bide my time. +Don't worry, it isn't very far from here.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Huh? No way, I want to go with you.
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:An extra pair of eyes means a better chance of spotting the enemy. You can take a lot of credit if you discover Gager. +But if you miss her...there will nothing in it for either of us. +I take it that you're the kind of Doll who seizes every victory?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:What do you mean?
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:You strike me as someone who never lets a single chance of victory slip by and will do anything to succeed.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Oh, of course! I'm exactly that kind of Doll! +Trust me, Fräulein Kar, I'll certainly help you destroy that Sangvis ringleader, and you'd better remember that!
MP41(0);98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:Sure, I will. +Now listen carefully. If the Sangvis ringleader doesn't show herself by dawn, then we're out of luck. +In that case, you must go back to the base and withdraw like a good girl.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:What about you, Fräulein Kar?
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||:I'll withdraw on my own. +Surely you can find your way back without me, right?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>;98k(0)||:Of...of course! I'll be fine even on my own!
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:But you'd better not tweak the combat report while I'm not with you! +Huh? Where did she go?
()||<黑屏1>:By the time MP41 realizes she's alone, Kar98k had already disappeared into the darkness...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...Fine. Just you wait, Fräulein Kar. +I will definitely find that Gager. +Then all the Dolls at the base and even the Commander will shower me with praise! +But before that, I'd better clean up this surveillance hideout a bit. +I think I'm gonna move this shrub out of my face... Whoa!
()||:The moment MP41 pushes the shrub away, she finds G43's face looming right over her.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Oh, MP41! So you're alive.
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:What are you talking about?!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:I thought you got captured by Sangvis Ferri. I was just thinking... +That if I still couldn't find you after making another round, I'd return to the base on my own.
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Sigh, low-spec Dolls really can't be trusted... +I found Fräulein Kar just now and she asked me to stay here as her spotter!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:I see... Well, I apologize as a low-spec Doll. +In that case, I'm heading back and leaving you with your "Fräulein Kar".
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:True... With Fräulein Kar...
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:(Thank goodness!) +Alright then, off I go. Good luck with your mission. Have fun. Tschüss—
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Wait! +Actually, a spotter could also use some protection! +We've still got a deal!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||<黑屏1>:No way... +(Sobs) I'm sorry, Commander. +I'll never touch things just because they look interesting again...
