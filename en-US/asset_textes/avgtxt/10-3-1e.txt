()||<BIN>99</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:An hour ago, in the trench where the AR Team is fighting.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:You're finally here...Judge!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:I'm not interested in you. Where is M4A1?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Aren't you the ones hacking her?! You won't find her!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Scooping out someone's neural cloud and measuring its worth... +...I don't enjoy doing it, but it's just part of a Judge's job.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:It's a piece of cake storming in here, Signorina Judge.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:But the Commander's troops are pouring in from outside. Your rear forces won't be able to withstand them!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I don't care about what happens to my rear forces. All that matters is your judgment.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Even if you have M4A1, you won't make it out alive! +The Military is about to capture your Mastermind! Aren't you the slightest bit worried?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:You know nothing, M4 SOPMOD II. +You've spent so much time with M4A1, yet you don't even know what she's worth.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:I don't give a damn what she's worth! She's my friend – my family! Nothing else matters!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||:Then die for her right here!
()||:...The Sangvis vanguard are headed straight for them.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Ceno, can you handle this?!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Easy peasy. I can take another wave.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:You're clearly hurt, Miss Ceno! Find cover!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Draw back and huddle up near me!
()||:...The surviving T-Dolls draw together and concentrate their fire to repel the Sangvis assault.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Take a break, Ceno. See if anyone is responding to our distress call.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...Nothing, sorella, but there's something else. +A military signal is approaching in our direction. Specs unknown.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Is that reinforcement from the Military? We couldn't contact them at all.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:We still can't. I don't know if it's reinforcement and I honestly don't care. +The Military isn't even willing to spare some time to help out us poor Griffin T-Dolls.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:At least it's an ally. Keep sending the distress signal. +It's not entirely hopeless for us! The Commander will be here soon! Just hold on for a little longer!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Miss Cano, Miss Ceno... +I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Haha, it's our honor!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Don't speak for me.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Hey, you're the one who told me about the situation here, Ceno.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:I only wanted you to get in trouble.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What are you talking about? How did you even learn of our situation?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:We heard it from XM3. +We and XM3 joined Griffin at around the same time. She was killed in a mission to protect Signorina M4A1 earlier...
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Her first death was meaningful. I envy her.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Fortunately, her neural cloud wasn't too badly damaged. +She said she still remembered M4A1 and wanted us to pass on a message to her.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What message?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:She wanted to say sorry. +If she'd known she would die so soon, she would've softened her words.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:As in she would've been more forthcoming about how she really felt.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:But since she's still stuck in the repair bay, we're here to deliver the message instead.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Don't misunderstand. We only came because the Commander gave the order.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Though we did volunteer to bolster our numbers.
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Such a ruthless battlefield. I weep for all our losses.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:You're obviously crying because of your wounds. Don't try to hide it!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But this IS a battlefield. You came diving in all because of what she said? Isn't that a bit excessive?
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:It's precisely because this is a battlefield. +Whether it's the AR Team, Ceno and I, or even other T-Dolls, we all live on in each other's neural cloud. +If we can't even keep each other's memory alive, who would remember us?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:You once asked me...why we're equipped with emotion modules despite being tools of combat. +The thing is, having emotions is a flaw in itself, SOP-II. T-Dolls or humans, we are all defective beings.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I don't know... But emotion modules are something that humans gave to us. No one would intentionally make their own products defective right? +So...there must be some meaning to all of this.
AR-15()<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'm doing what must be done. +Hurry, SOP-II. Get out of the jam. +M4 is still waiting for you. Protect her. I'm counting on you...
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN>:SOP-II, how much emotion have you been penning up? +Let it all out now and enjoy this fight!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:And this death.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏2<BIN>9</BIN>><BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:Commander...I know you're still fighting for us with everything you have. +We are also doing our best to survive, so that we can keep M4A1 safe, so that we can see you again. +So please remember me as who I am today. Whether we win or lose, I'm very, very content. +I hope we'll meet again. Please, no matter what you do, remember what we did today.
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker><通讯框>||:Still not giving up? You won't last much longer!
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:We don't plan on lasting too long. We only need to last as long as we can!
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Sorella, while there's still time, I just want to say I'm very happy.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:You're telling the truth?
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Duh.
Carcano1891(0)<Speaker>Cano</Speaker>||:Heheh, I wish there's more time for us to talk. +Alright, Griffins, our moment of glory is at hand! Are you ready for it? +Alla vittoria—
Carcano1938(0)<Speaker>Ceno</Speaker>||:Alla gloria militar!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Is everybody here? +My dear Sangvis prey, it's time for us to feast. +Bon appétit!
