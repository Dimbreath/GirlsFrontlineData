MK2(0)<Speaker>STEN Mk Ⅱ</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Excuse me... Are you Griffin troops?+Oh, thank goodness! Safe at last! Could you take me with you?+Thank you so much, Commander! I'll do my best!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>8</BIN>:...We seem to have come across a stranded T-Doll manufactured by Griffin,+so we've brought her back along with our troops.
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Huh? A stranded T-Doll?+Thank goodness you took her in, that poor thing.
NPC-Kalin(7)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Sangvis attacks have intensified all of a sudden in the last few days.+We've lost a few command posts, and lots of T-Dolls were either stranded or left behind...
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:So if it's possible, please save as many of 'em as you can.+Not just to expand our forces, but also to save HQ some manufacturing orders.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And more importantly, these T-Dolls are all hella cute!+...I know right? I just knew you'd love 'em!+Human or T-Doll, we all have our own missions, and are all irreplaceable members of Griffin.+With that in mind, I'm sure you'll rock this job!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Now to give you a better idea of your job, Commander...
()<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>17</BIN><黑点1>:Griffin Security Contractor is a private military organization comprised mainly of Tactical Dolls.+It is our duty to accept commissions from financial groups and other organizations and safeguard human settlements.+As of now, the biggest threats to our territories are rogue T-Dolls manufactured by Sangvis Ferri.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>8</BIN>:And your job is to manage and direct T-Doll troops in repelling Sangvis forces in the area.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:I'm sure you'll do great. The drill result speaks for itself, right?+Then that settles it! For the sake of everyone at Griffin, please make good use of your talent!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:And that's the end of this operation, Commander.
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh, remember to check your list of 【Quests】 and accept that T-Doll's enlistment!
