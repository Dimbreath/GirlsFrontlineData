()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>150</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Wake</BGM>:How's 45?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Stable enough for now; at least more stable than you.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What about me?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Look at the face you're making.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Do I look unhappy? +Do you have any idea what I gave up today?
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I don't want to know. +I'm just glad you came back alive.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:At least 45 will be pleased.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Her? Pleased? +She just can't be bothered to find a new recruit.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:And...what's wrong with that? +It's hard to find a teammate like you...
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:9... +I haven't changed my mind yet. +One day, I'll still go my own way.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I know, but at least you're here now. +I think that's the most reassuring thing to all of us.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I didn't come back to reassure you. +I just...
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:416... +...I'm sleepy.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...416 sighs.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Stupid dormouse. We'll see who's going to wake up first, you or 45. +Then I'll dunk the loser into a mud puddle.
()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:You say that... +But in the end...you'll still gonna...fetch me back... +Zzz...zzzZZZZZZzzz...
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Giggles) She already admitted defeat.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What an idiot. +...Maybe I'm also an idiot.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:We're all idiots, I suppose.
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No, you're not. You're a witch.
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:But if we're all idiots... +...Isn't that what makes us a family?
()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That's just wishful thinking on your part, 9. You— +...You're...crying?
()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0.5</黑屏1>:It's just that...we've been through so much... +But right now...I feel so happy...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0.5</黑屏2>:...416 remains silent. +She looks at the Griffin T-Dolls outside the window. They're bustling about in preparation of returning to the war zone on a rescue mission. +She knows who the target is, but she doesn't care. +All that matters to her is the short-lived peace in the present, a brief moment of happiness that they can savor. +Tomorrow, their story will continue.

Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:I do not understand, Commander, how you are still in the mood to tell jokes under such circumstances.
Nyto(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<闪屏><duration>5</duration></闪屏><震屏>:...Smack!
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Crude jokes won't fool us no matter how many times you try.
()||:She used her leg this time - or rather, a weapon in the shape of a leg. +I'm starting to miss when she was using her arm. Of course, I didn't enjoy it in the slightest, but it was certainly a lot gentler than this. +My stomach heaves and I hurl up its contents. I can see what these cold-blooded puppets have been feeding me for the last two months... +I stare at the vomit and blood on the floor, but I've got to admit - I was asking for it. I should've come up with a better story.
Nyto(0)<Speaker>Nyto</Speaker>||:Now, amend your account. +We know what happened to 416, but we need to find out where she has gone. Your answer must coincide with the subsequent events.
()||:Look on the bright side... +At least I managed to buy a bit more time again, though I'm not sure how much my body can still take. +My head is spinning; I can feel my will crumbling, but I cannot give in. I must make my story convincing... +Or at the very least...a bit more credible.
