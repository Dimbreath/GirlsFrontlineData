M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Hmm? Where's NZ?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Doesn't seem to be here. What should we do?
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:It's fine. I know what to do...+Hey, NZ! Your new dress is here! This one has the print of...
()||<震屏>:Clang!
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Oh, so you were up there the whole time...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<震屏>:S-S-Screw you!+I didn't buy any new dress whatsoever!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Whatever. It can't be any more tasteless than the one you got last week anyway...+Hurry up and give the chief your report!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Jeez...+Report as follows: many Sangvis bases lie ahead, but security level is relatively low. Shouldn't be too big a problem as long as we're careful.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:Where can we resupply?+I mean somewhere with proper food, not energy bars or chocolate.
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Oh, about that...+Sorry to tell you...but all the supply outposts along the route are either destroyed or looted after the security system went down...
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker><震屏>||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:W-What?!+Dammit! I knew I should've ignored the arrangement and swapped with you!
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:It'd have been the same no matter who had this job. Besides, my stomach is also growling here...
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Then there's nothing we can do.+Let's dig in on the emergency canned food and move the stuff quickly.+The locals there will surely show us some great hospitality...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:Humph. They're counting on relief supplies. Don't expect them to cook us anything decent.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||:I say we pop the crates open and keep some stuff for ourselves. No one's gonna find out.
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:No, these goods are to be transported on the military's order. We must not touch them!+You're known for being honest, 56! How could you even suggest such a thing?!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type56-1</Speaker>||<震屏>:So what if I'm honest?! Doesn't mean I'll take this crap!+No one can fight on an empty stomach!
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:To be honest, while I'm not as passionate about food as 56...+I also find it hard to keep up my spirits with just a few ration cans when there's nowhere to resupply...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:We are technically authorized to borrow resources from humans to maintain our operational efficiency, right?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:That's true...but please hang in there for just a little longer.+We're not far from our destination. Let's travel farther ahead. We're bound to come across a supply outpost that's intact at some point...I hope...
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||:I almost thought you were gonna say we're bound to come across an oasis...
97typeS(0)<Speaker>Type97S</Speaker>||:Just listen to the chief, NZ. We're under orders, after all.+We must stay united and work together, and bear with any difficulties we encounter, got it?
NZ75(0)<Speaker>NZ75</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk. Then hurry up already. Let's get this over with ASAP.
