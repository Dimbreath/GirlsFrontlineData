()||<BIN>8</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sunshine</BGM>:A week after the Lightning Incident. Griffin Control in Area S09.
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:I see. So you're a soldier too?
FNFNC(0);BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Yeah... I'm still trying to wrap my head around what I've heard about things in this world...
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;BB_Noel(2)||<BIN>8</BIN>:I thought fashion from the future would be more stylish.
FNFNC(0);BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:S-Sorry...for disappointing you. +But...do you believe me?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;BB_Noel(2)||<BIN>8</BIN>:It's not like I don't believe you. I just don't really care either way... +Completing our mission is all that matters to us T-Dolls.
FNFNC(0);BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:T-Dolls...so you really aren't human. +If you're androids, are you equipped with things like rocket fists or thrusters?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;BB_Noel(2)||<BIN>8</BIN>:...Are your androids equipped with such things?
FNFNC(0);BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Hmm... They're more like cyborgs, I guess...
FNFNC(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Well, aren't you two getting along well?
FNFNC(0)<Speaker>FF FNC</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Oh, FAL. Is it time to eat?
FNFNC(0);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:There's some bread, but let's talk about the mission first.+Ever since the Lightning Incident, S.F. has been launching attack after attack in nearby territories. +We've been receiving casualty reports from neighboring regions of Area S09. +Moreover...according to witnesses, there's someone with bunny ears among the Sangvis units.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Bunny ears! C-Could it be...
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Unbelievable as it may be, that seems to be the one you were referring to.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:It has to be her! If we can find her, I can go back!
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:At the moment, this bunny girl's motive is unclear... +But she's bothering us with all this trouble she's been stirring up. +Since she's your target as well, we have no choice but to work together.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Fantastic! I have hope of going home!
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN>:Sorry, Mademoiselle Noel, but let's not get too excited. +You're still under suspicion yourself, so your freedom is still restricted.
BB_Noel(2)<Speaker>Noel</Speaker>;FAL(0)||<BIN>8</BIN>:Oh... I'm sorry... I forgot my place...
BB_Noel(2);FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>8</BIN><黑点1>:The report has forecast the possible location of the next Sangvis attack. +Allez, girls, and get the one who's stuffing her face... +Operation Rabbit Hunt is about to begin.
FN49(0)<Speaker>FF FN49</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑点2>:Th-This is Point B... Evacuation of all residents confirmed.
FN57(0)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Point C also checked. There shouldn't be a problem, I suppose?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||<BIN>10</BIN><BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>:Très bien. Now we just have to sit tight and wait for the rabbit to set off the trap...
FAL(0);BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Nice setup. Your effort is much appreciated.
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;BOSS-4(0)<通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Intruder? How could it be you?!
FAL(0);BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Forgive me, I can't let you see the Rabbit for now. +But I trust that you won't be too offended if I take part in the show in her place?
FAL(0)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>;BOSS-4(0)<通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Both you and the Rabbit are on our bucket list. +Though it seems like we can strike your name off early.
FAL(0);BOSS-4(0)<Speaker>Intruder</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN>:Then thank you for your hospitality. Let us make the most of our chance meeting.
