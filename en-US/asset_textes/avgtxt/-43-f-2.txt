()||<BIN>302</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:... +At the New York Public Library. +Not long after M870's clash with Springfield...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tell me the truth about something.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:There is no Santa Claus. It was your parents all along.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ehhhhh? Do you have parents, 416?!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...C'mon, I'm being serious.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's a dangerous word to use, 416. +Don't forget we're playing a game now.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Didn't you say you were serious about winning the prize?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Well, I'm not saying I'm going to step aside and let other people have the prize either. +But don't go lumping two completely different matters together. +So, what were you going to ask?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I've just been wondering, do you actually have a concrete plan?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We aren't on the battlefield, 416. +We know nothing about the setting of this game, or have you been to America before? +We see the situation and respond appropriately, we adapt to all challenges and overcome them. That's our specialty, isn't it?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Is that why you were lying prone in a grass patch laughing at Squad M870 like a lunatic for almost 20 minutes?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:But they WERE funny, weren't they? At times like these you should just go along and laugh with me. +Oh, there's no need to put on that constipated face of yours. Who are you trying to impress, anyway?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I have no idea what you're talking about. It doesn't seem the least bit funny.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Either you're very out of touch with your feelings or you're a really good actress. +In any case, I really HAVE seen everything now. +That lot from Griffin are really good at springing surprises on you.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Haha, it's true, and that M870 Doll is quite amusing. +She's just chewing up the scenery.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Springfield's taken good care of us every time we stopped over in Griffin. +Don't take it too far.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, ja, I know, our Lady 416 is chivalrous to a fault. +Is this how noble Dolls are different from us?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:ELITE Dolls. +I've never heard of "noble Dolls" before.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Alright, I get it. +While there's no way she'd remember us, it's true that she's done us a few good turns in the past. +And as you know, I always return others' favors. +So, wouldn't it be kind of us to spare them the ruthlessness of this game by ousting them?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Aren't you blowing things out of proportion? +Neither of them took any losses, did they? +I mean, just look at Squad M870 and Squad Springfield.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:All because 416 did something unnecessary, don't you think?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What does that have to do with me? If I hadn't launched the flashbang, their conflict wouldn't have intensified, would it? +Everything went your way in the end, right?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's true. Oh my, I suppose it all comes down to Springfield's saintly nature.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So now what? +What do you plan to do next?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Given Springfield's personality, pitting her against other teams would be pointless. +Now, M870, on the other hand, makes an excellent target. +Even if it's just for the sake of the prize money, we need to eliminate our weaker opponents first.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:So you're saying we're going to give up on Squad Springfield and guide M870 and her sidekicks instead?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Exactly. That'll also be less risky for us. +When you compare the two, idiots are easier to manipulate, don't you think?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...No comment.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Now, the first thing we have to do is take care of the Griffin HQ Squad~♪ +They're kind of an eyesore, considering how they're in the way of my prize.+9.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Understood~
()||<黑点1>:9 chuckles as she picks up a rock...
()||<黑点2>:A rock comes flying at M870 out of nowhere. Fortunately, she ducks in time, and no harm is done.
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||:Who did that? Who has the balls to assault an officer in broad daylight?! +You, that Doll over there! Was it you? +Yes, you, the one with the silver hair! Hold it right there!
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<黑点1>:...
()||<黑点2>:...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh, now that was a good throw.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Hehe, I've had practice, you know. +How is it, how is it? Are they fighting yet?
()||:9 creeps forward to take a look, but 45 shoves her back.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dummkopf, they'll spot you.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:In any case, they've made contact, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
()||:416 is right - out of the three people in the distance, M870 is the only agitated one. Meanwhile, VSK-94 and Vector both seem very composed.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Looks like both of them are the calm type. +I guess you can't count on them to start fights easily, no? +After all, there was no proof that Vector threw the stone. +She has no legitimate reason to attack Vector.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk tsk... How naïve. +You think people won't attack each other without a proper reason? +If the world were actually so reasonable, there'd be no more wars.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Please, not everyone is as rotten as you. +Still, sounds to me she's just a bit too into her character as a police officer, don't you think?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It's role-play gone mad. +In the end, her own characterization tripped her up. +So you need to charge someone with a crime if you want to do anything to them? How dumb is that.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:What now? Looks like they aren't going to fight. +Are we really going to let them go just like that? +Oh, Vector's leaving.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Tsk. Come on, try harder!
()||:M870 suddenly calls out to Vector as the latter is about to leave. However, judging by the dubious looks in VSK-94 and Vector's eyes, she doesn't seem to have figured out what she wants to say yet.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I didn't expect her to be so useless.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Should we just fire a shot their way?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Nah, that would be too obvious. +...Hang on, look at M870.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Hm?
()||<黑点2>:...
M870P(4)<Speaker>M870</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You are guilty of —+<size=50>ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS!!!</size>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑点2>:<color=#00CCFF>PUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!</color>
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...This is gross. She's laughing her ass off but she isn't making a sound. +Look at her, she's writhing around like a maggot.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well, we'd be spotted if she actually laughed out loud. +Fortunately this game has a team channel.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Hah... Oh these Griffin Dolls, are they trying to make me laugh to death and then steal my savings? +Illegal possession of firearms... What kind of neural cloud does she have to come up with a joke like that? +She could be making more money as a stand-up comedian than wasting time grubbing for money with us.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Whoa...
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What is it, what is it? Did something even funnier happen? +Let me see!
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Well... +M870 and VSK-94 are fighting each other.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Pffft...ahahahahahaha!! +Oh those two, they really are trying to make me laugh to death, aren't they?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...Granted, this whole situation really is quite ridiculous. But if you keep laughing like this, the screws are going to fall out of that patchwork body of yours.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I can't stand this anymore... 9, give me a hand, hahaha... +It's a shame Gr G11 can't see this, I need to tell her all about it once we're back.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Looks like Vector's at a loss too... So what now? +In the end, you didn't cause her any trouble at all, did you?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's fine. It's good enough that we got rid of those two clowns. +Also... As I recall, there are four people on Squad Vector, right? Where are the other two?
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I think it was Vector's tactical decision as team leader. +They must have split up, with R93 and K5 going the other way.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Huh...they're splitting their forces even in these dangerous conditions. +Looks like they're pretty confident.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Vector is one of the few elites in Griffin. +She may look as dull as dishwater, but she's extremely stubborn.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What, since when did you become a Griffin Encyclopedia? +Or are you one of her fans?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I won't dignify that with a reply.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Humph... Very stubborn indeed. +Then we'll give her a taste of the cruelty of this world. +Since the ideal conditions have arisen, it would be a shame not to make use of them.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Taking them out one by one, hm? I love it when 45 is being despicable.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Who's despicable?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Stop strangling your teammate. +So, who's first?
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:R93, of course. +You said it, didn't you? Vector is one of the few elites in Griffin. +I'm not in the habit of throwing myself at my enemy's strengths just to teach them a lesson.
()||:45 starts humming cheerfully to herself as she turns to head the other way.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... +She said she was only in it for the money... +But in the end she's the most hardcore when it comes to playing the game...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Seriously... +What's the fun in skulking around in the shadow...
