()||:【Your plan seems to be going quite smoothly, Chief.】
()||:【...What is it this time?】
()||:【Griffin didn't run into much trouble in Tallinn, even the Military's armored train came to a stop a long way away.】+【Is that your way of showing concern for Griffin? By giving them a relatively easier job?】
()||:【...】
()||:【Yeah, I knew it was unlikely the case. The plan might look straightforward, but there are actually a lot of variables. I trust you've already investigated the coordinates provided by William?】
()||:【Since there isn't in fact a Pike Node there, there isn't much need for us to get involved.】
()||:【You seem to have a lot of faith in Griffin's capabilities.】+【When venturing deep into a heavily contaminated zone and heading for a base that's only accessible through a single route, if they get surrounded, their only option would be to jump into the sea.】
()||:【If I remember correctly, it wasn't me who came up with this idea. It was you.】
()||:【Yes, yes, you won't mobilize because the Pike Node isn't there.】+【However, the Mastermind which both you and William are so interested in has been spotted over there. I gather you're aware of that?】
()||:【...】
()||:【Given what happened in the Butterfly Incident, I understand why you're going to such lengths to avert suspicion.】+【If anyone brought up this whole Relics business again, the newly reconstituted negotiation would be severely hindered again.】+【But don't worry, I'll gladly do you a small favor.】
()||:【I know you've sent her there.】
()||:【She isn't an agent any more. Besides, it's not like you have anything against her, right?】+【William...and Lyco's legacy. I'll bring you everything that you want - while keeping the bits that I need for myself.】
()||:【If you cross the line, I will not hesitate when giving the execution order.】
()||<黑屏1>:【Save that order for my old friend, if you can arrest and capture him, that is.】+【Glad to have you on board. Good luck.】
