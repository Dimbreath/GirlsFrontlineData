NPC-PasserbyF(0)<Speaker>Civilian</Speaker>||:S-stay away from me! Help!
()<Speaker>Garrison Soldier</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Residents, evacuate to the nearest shelter immediately! Don't open the door until they stand down the alert! +Garrison of Gate E4 hailing Garrison HQ! ELIDs have invaded the city! We have entered combat! Requesting reinforcements!

NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑点2>:<color=#A9A9A9>M4, AK-12, report! Answer me!</color>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Well...
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, we couldn't stop the rebels. They detonated the explosives. +The explosion wasn't particularly big, it just blew a hole in the quarantine wall, but even so, it's large enough that plugging the breach is not going to be easy.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Copy that. I understand.</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:What are you planning to do, Ange?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>They punched a hole through the wall...and at the worst possible time...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>With just half of Task Force DEFY, we're pretty much helpless under the circumstances. At a time like this...</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is Lieutenant Dragović, Acting Commander of the Eastern Garrison.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Attention all garrison units - we have received reports that the quarantine wall has been destroyed by rebel forces not long ago.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Do not panic. Everyone heed my command and hold your ground!</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>That sounds like...the wounded officer we came across.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ange, I have an idea.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Being a busybody again?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:Let her finish. What are you trying to say, M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We coordinated with the officer of the local garrison while clearing the rebel forces. That's how we acquired our military IFF signals and comms frequency. +We alone can't stop the ELIDs, but if we work with the garrison troops...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:I see, borrowing the strength of the local garrison is indeed a valid solution. +Patch me through. I'm gonna have a proper chat with that guy.
()||:After making some small adjustments to the comms settings, Ange's digitally-distorted voice is transmitted through the channel. 
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You seem to be having some trouble, Lieutenant Dragović.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:Who are you? Which unit are you from? Why do you have access to this channel?
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You've met my subordinates before. You probably remember them.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:...I see. +If it hadn't been for you, we'd have been completely crushed by the bastards. +No matter who you're with, I owe you one.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Let's leave that for later. We're both short on time.</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>What's your current situation? How long can you last? When will your reinforcements arrive?</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:It's chaos. My forces are putting their lives on the line to hold the upper wall, but the bottom has already been breached by the ELIDs...
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:Most of the troops on the wall, including me, don't actually have much combat experience. Our tactical teams have also been separated so it's difficult for us to mount an organized defense.
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:Also, we haven't been able to contact HQ. There's been no response to our communications. I doubt we'll be getting any reinforcements at all.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Tsk... The worst possible scenario, huh...</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Tell your subordinates to save their ammo and try their best to retreat into narrow passages or corridors.</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Concentrate your fire and rebuild your defense line. Do that first to make sure you don't get overrun.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:Understood... But if we draw back to within the wall, more ELIDs will force their way into the city...
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you die here, no one will be left to stop the ELIDs.</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:...Right, I'll have my forces fire at the infected creatures to give us cover while we safeguard our defense line.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Each minute you fight, you'll kill more ELIDs and give the citizens of Belgrade a better chance to survive.</color>
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hold the wall and stay in touch. We'll find a way to give you support. Over.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>AK-12, M4, you heard that?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>From now on, support the garrison troops in defending the wall and focus on helping isolated forces return to their garrison.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Our priority is to minimize their casualities and stop the ELIDs from entering the city. Hold out until reinforcements get here.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:As always, you're the kind of person who enjoys surfing in a thunderstorm.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm not that stupid. Besides, we're doing ourselves a favor by helping these garrison troops.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>We'll find a way to withdraw to the safe zone once this is over.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But some ELIDs have already broken through the wall and into the city, and the Collapse contamination has also started seeping in thanks to the destruction of the purification tower and the storm. +If you don't want to take another radiation bath, I suggest you stay indoors. Just leave everything on the frontlines to M4 and me.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I know. With ELIDs crawling all over the place, running around like a headless chicken is suicide.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If there's only a single breach, it should be pretty easy to tell where the ELIDs are coming from...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...If everything goes well, we should be able to keep the damage to a minimum with the help of the garrison troops.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Question is, will everything actually go that well?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>To stir up waves in still waters... To turn bad things to our advantage... That's Task Force DEFY's mission.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, focus on fighting. I have other things to sort out.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>...K, do you read me?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Why have you broken radio silence?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The purification tower is screwed. +...Not that you'd care about that, I suppose.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Just get to the point.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:There are too many ELIDs and I don't have enough people, not to mention the oncoming storm. Time is short. I need you to send in more troops to lend me support near the wall.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I can't.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:Why?!
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><Shake>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:Ahem...I just need them to round off the ELIDs; that's hardly an unreasonable request!
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:Perhaps I should seriously consider just how much you care about this mission.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't think too much. Just carry out your orders.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:Care to listen to my suspicions about you?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Did these suspicions form over the last few seconds?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I believe I'm not obliged to listen, nor am I obliged to offer you any explanation—</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:For example, maybe there's actually a secret agenda to this mission?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're overthinking it, woman. That's not good for your health, mental or physical.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>As a Statesec agent, you simply have to do your job. That's the only thing you're good for.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:Oh? And here I thought I was a renegade.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>All the more reason why you need me.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:...What do you—
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have no wish to concern myself with what you have done or who you used to be. Those things mean nothing to me.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You're nothing more than a tool, and right now I'm the only one who can tell where your loyalties lie.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I hope you can remember that. Now shut up.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)<通讯框>||:...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:Dammit, it's always like this. +He always says that everything is under his control, that he can provide all the support at his disposal, but when shit goes down, we're always on our own.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Disappointed?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:I never had any hopes for reinforcements. There's nothing to be disappointed about.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Still, I must say...K actually has a point. Stopping the ELIDs has never been our job to begin with. We can still leave this mess if we want to.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Judging by the speed at which these ELIDs are swarming in, I'm afraid I can't say the same in another ten minutes. Your location won't be safe for long.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:...It isn't time yet.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:Abandoning the wall will make the rest of our operation even more difficult. At least hold out till AR-15 and AN-94 complete their objective.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So we're buying them time...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:What's the situation?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1Mod</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Order is gradually being restored, but things still aren't looking good.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1Mod</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Almost all garrison outposts are in a state of emergency...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1Mod</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>From what I saw, these soldiers are practically panic-shooting, and their accuracy is...</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>With this level of training, I'm afraid they won't last very long.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, I just eavesdropped on the comms of the local garrison.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It appears that neither the mobilization of backup forces nor the evacuation of civilians are going too well.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>;AK12(0)<通讯框>||:The majority of them are youngsters who have never seen real combat. You can't expect them to be too capable. On top of that, the garrisons have been infiltrated. This must also be part of their plan.
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Actually, the main reason why things have gone down so badly is because the rebels seized control of all automated heavy weapons beforehand.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1Mod</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But they have all pretty much been destroyed in the previous battle...by us.</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What else could we have done? We didn't have the luxury to spare the armored units and the tanks.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<SE1>Explode</SE1><黑屏1>:Besides, as long as we still have ammo and we make sure the ELIDs are only coming from one direction, then the situation isn't exactly beyond...

M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Too many people are trying to communicate simultaneously; coupled with the EM storm, the signals are getting all scrambled!
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>M4, can you see the location of the explosion? Do you have visuals?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:There...there's a second opening on the wall! +I...I'm sending you the location!

AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||:It could be a time-delayed bomb. That would explain why the first explosion was a lot smaller than expected. +The rebels probably planned to trigger the second explosion as the rescue teams and engineer corps rushed in to plug the first opening.
AK12(2);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That hardly matters anymore. More importantly, if they're caught in between, then the garrison troops...</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)<通讯框>||<黑点1>:Holding our position here no longer serves any purpose. We must leave this place before we're attacked from both sides.

()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:I know... ELIDs have already started appearing from behind! We're only holding a small section at the top of the wall...
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>As you can see, the situation has become even more precarious. There's no point in defending the wall at this point.</color>

()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:I can see that the other teams are still doing everything they can to destroy the ELIDs. If we leave, they'll lose fire support and take the brunt of the attack. I can't just abandon them.
()<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You want to drag your subordinates with you to hell?</color>
()<Speaker>Garrison Officer</Speaker>||:...You were right. Every ELID we kill will buy more time for the citizens of Belgrade.
