NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||:Well done, Commander. The injured T-Dolls should arrive any minute.+These T-Dolls are especially valued because they are possible witnesses to some intel.+If the intel proves to be true, it might mean open war between us and Sangvis Ferri.+...Yes, 'us', and that includes your troops, Commander.
 ()||:...Click.+A ping comes from behind Helian.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Oh? Looks like the T-Dolls are back.+Please excuse me.

MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Humph, so we're back already...+Not the slightest bit of fun during the whole thing. I was bored to tears.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:Save it, Ingram.+If it hadn't been for the T-Dolls that came to HQ's aid, you'd be in big trouble.
NPC-Helian(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Tsk. It was a chance for me to risk my life.+After all, the riskier it is, the more I revel in combat.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:Not this time, Ingram.+You're one of the few survivors still capable of speech. There are some things I have to confirm with you.
NPC-Helian(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:Fine, you're the boss. Whatever you say.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:What happened to STG-44 and PPSh-41, do you remember?
NPC-Helian(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:I only know that Agent got there. She seemed to be in a hurry chasing something.+We only made it out alive because we weren't her targets.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:Hmm...+VZ-61 is the only one still missing. You two are close, aren't you? Do you know her whereabouts?
NPC-Helian(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:(Shrugs) Sorry, but I wasn't on the frontline back then.+However...if she's still alive, she'll probably find a way to leave behind clues.+That gal...can be very sharp when it counts.
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:...Understood.+That's all I need from you. Go and get repaired.
NPC-Helian(0);MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||:...Miss Helian.+Will we have our vengeance...for Skorpion, and all the other T-Dolls?
NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>;MAC10(1)||:...+Hurry up and get yourself patched up, Ingram.+Very soon...you can have your share of fun.
MAC10(1)<Speaker>Ingram</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:(Grins) ...Understood.+That's exactly what I want to hear.
