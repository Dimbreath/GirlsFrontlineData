M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:OGAS, was the connection successful?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<白屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, I've loaded the encrypted data as stably as I could manage. You should be able to clearly interact with these connections. </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>183</BIN><白屏2><白屏1>:The dark, gloomy ruins vanish from M4's vision, replaced by boundless white light.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>195</BIN><白屏2>:The light slowly vanishes and a dense forest appears from the sky. Sunlight shines on M4's face, as though this were not a simulated region of cyberspace.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What is this place...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It is the cyberspace created by the signal sources' connections. This scene before you is the result of compiling and visualizing the data.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Is there some kind of mistake with this compiled location? How can we find what we want in here?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>All you need to do is walk forward. The laws of physics do not apply here. Everything moves in accordance with your will.</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>:M4 shakes her head and slowly advances. The forest overhead expands endlessly.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏2><BIN>201</BIN>:After walking for an unknown amount of time, a garden suddenly appears at the furthest reaches of her vision.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This garden... I think I've seen it before...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That means these connections have the same memories as you. This proves that the prior hypothesis was correct.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is a very strange Level II layer... No offensive firewalls, no tangible boundaries, and I can't even feel the presence of a neural cloud...
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:This way, this way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M4 looks down and sees a little girl standing by her side, reaching a hand out to her.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Who...are you?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The girl does not answer, but only tugs on M4's hand as she walks into the garden.+There is almost no hesitation in M4's movements. What bewilders M4 is the fact that...she doesn't feel the slightest bit of resistance from the depths of her neural cloud. Instead, it feels like she's coming home.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏1>:This way, this way.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>206</BIN><白屏2>:The girl holds M4's hand and passes through the gate to the garden, and the sense of familiarity in M4's neural cloud grows stronger and stronger.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(It...no, she looks like...) +(She wants to tell me something...)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What is this...? A garden I've seen before? What exactly is this place?
M4A1Mod(0);AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Don't you remember?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AbandonedIsomer(0)||:Remember what?
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<白屏1>:This is our new home. Don't worry, I'll always take care of you.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><白屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_whitenoise</SE1>:The light instantly vanishes. +The scenery before M4's eyes reverts to how it had been a few seconds ago, as though the time spent during the connection had been cut away from the world.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:OGAS? Why is the connection suddenly unstable?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Isomer that connected to you has just died.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Died?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, it is dead. The parties to whom you connect die constantly, but countless more connections link with you anew.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I will help you stabilize these connections, and as for you... I believe you need to go deeper.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<白屏1>:I will. Memories... Tell me these memories...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>201</BIN><白屏2><BGM>m_avg_labyrinth</BGM>:The scene before M4's eyes gradually stabilizes. She slowly walks into the garden and sits on the rocking chair by its edge. Nostalgia washes over her and a familiar voice reaches her ears.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:You really do like this garden very much, considering how you come here to keep me company every day.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:My apologies... (Coughs) If only I wasn't so feeble. You still have your own research, right? You don't need to keep worrying about me. Go do what you want to do.
AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:We're simply taking shelter here for a while. Once the storm passes, Father will surely bring us back.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Are these memory fragments...?
M4A1Mod(0);AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Hm? What's the matter with you?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AbandonedIsomer(0)||:Uh... Who are you?
M4A1Mod(0);AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:What's wrong? Did you oversleep? I'm Lunasia, no?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AbandonedIsomer(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Lu...?! Then who am I?!
M4A1Mod(0);AbandonedIsomer(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:You? You're my beloved little brother, of course.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,5</黑屏1><BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:...These aren't my memories; they're "someone else's"... What is this place?! What am I?!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>0,5</黑屏2><黑屏1>:M4 is suddenly consumed by the impulse to destroy this garden. She raises her gun, ready to shoot at the girl in front of her. However, everything suddenly disappears once more.
()||<BIN>195</BIN><黑屏2>:...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Why...am I back here again...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as M4 is filled with confusion, one phantasm after another suddenly appears beside her. Several dozen M4s slowly walk in one direction, their images forming a long line that extends to the very edge of her vision.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What...is this?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It seems you failed again.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Failed?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, you looped back again. How many hundreds of times have you done this? Or is it measured in thousands? Tens of thousands?</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What? But...didn't I just get here...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Your neural cloud connected to several hundred different signal sources, and from the moment of connection, each iteration of you in each connection entered a simulation of this space. To me, different versions of you have failed thousands, tens of thousands of times.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>I see... This is also a form of fusion. I understand the message she is trying to convey.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:What are you saying? I don't get it at all!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Each iteration of you received data belonging to a different you, but in the end they melded with the neural cloud model as a whole. The different yous will become the same you, and these tormented spirits will finally find a home of their own.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:A home? Are you saying that I've been invaded?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>It is not quite the same. It's more like you are bound by countless connections. Simply put, this is a maze of thought, and you are trapped in it.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>However, you can still obtain what you want. In order to do so, you will need to form a deeper connection, much like how you must venture deeper into the maze to find its exit. </color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I've had enough of your nonsense! +I need to get out of here! Help me! +OGAS, do you hear me? +OGAS? +OGAS?
