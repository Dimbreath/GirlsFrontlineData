()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:...In the cathedral.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Commander and the Dolls retreat into the cathedral, which has miraculously managed to remain largely intact. +If someone could repair the nasty burns and clear away the revolting splatters of ELIDs that got blown apart, one could even see the murals that was once a symbol of holiness and hope.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:How ironic...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 and SOP-II stop briefly before the statue of an angel... with one wing snapped off and its head buried in the rubble.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, did you say something?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Nothing much... Just feeling a bit melancholic at the sight of the cathedral. +God has set down the rules for humans and told them what is just, but look - this place, which is supposed to be God's domain, is now more like a graveyard than anything.
RO635(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:RO635 carefully strides over a body.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Humans clearly know what is righteous, yet conflicts have never ceased...
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But the Commander once said...what's that verse again... +For God...loved people...?
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:You mean, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son"?
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah, that's the one! +See, isn't it fair to say that things only turned out this way because people have been taking advantage of God's love and abusing their power? +There is no end to war...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:I'd say people aren't actually playing by God's rules...
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But if what that book says is true, then God will always forgive humans no matter what they do.
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:SOP-II kicks a broken statue on the floor angrily.
RO635(2);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:These people...will be forgiven for smashing statues. +They'll be forgiven for killing... +They'll even be forgiven for destroying an entire city...
RO635(2)<Speaker></Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:RO635 gives SOP-II a squeeze on the shoulder and ruffles her hair.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||<黑屏1>:(Softly) At least our Commander won't ever forgive those monsters... We will follow the Commander and eradicate the sins commited in the world bit by bit.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><黑屏2>:Meanwhile... on the other end of the cathedral.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||<震屏>:Aaack! +Why are there humans inside the cathedral?!
TEC9(0);NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:They're here to seek refuge. Don't shout, you'll scare them.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:(Mutters) They scared me first, okay...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Feeling a bit uneasy, TEC-9 reloads her weapon from behind cover and fires at the enemy. +But she has to stop soon enough.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:(Turns around) Hey...you can let your teeth chatter all you want, but do you mind not making it so loud...? +It's freaking me out...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Cowering in the corner, a few shuddering children stare fearfully at TEC-9, who's standing not too far away from them.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Why am I even talking to humans...?)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(But if I have to keep shooting those ELIDs, I'm really gonna puke.)</color>
孩童()<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||:...Are you killing people?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The abrupt question catches TEC-9 off-guard, leaving her a bit flustered.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Kalina? Where's Kalina?)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(Is X95 still away...?)</color>
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:Ahem...nope. +I'm just...slaying monsters.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||:Oh, monsters... +Those monsters...killed our mommy... (Sobs)
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:TEC-9 doesn't know what to say.
孩童()<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||:We will avenge Mommy!
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(Isn't it...way too early for these humans to think about such things...? Sigh.)</color>
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:Focus on staying alive first.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>Child</Speaker>||:Huh?
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||:...Try to survive for now. Run as far as you can when you see these monsters... +Leave the rest to us.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:It's surprising to see you communicating with humans properly. +So why can't you talk to the Commander like this? You're such a pain in the butt—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Kalina appears behind TEC-9 without warning.
TEC9(0)<Speaker>TEC-9</Speaker>||<震屏><黑屏1>:Huhhhh?! Where the hell did you come from, Kalin?! +(Chokes) Don't come too close you're scaring me...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>136</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Five minutes later.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:Commander, no more time for chit-chat! +The horde of ELIDs outside... Tsk, the attacks are getting stronger! 
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:This really isn't the time for chit-chat. +Though I just promised that Griffin Dolls are capable enough to hold the cathedral, judging by the current situation, it's actually going to be pretty tough. +All the Dolls in their respective teams are starting to show signs of fatigue.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They've been exchanging fire the whole time we were inside the cathedral... +Ugh...now it's down to whichever happens first - either we run out of ammo or they kill every last one of us. +I could tear them in two, but the artillery fire outside could also easily blow me to kingdom come...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Stop messing about, SOP-II. Follow the Commander's instructions. +We'll just...have to last till reinforcements get here.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>(RO probably wasn't there during the last transmission...)</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>(The radio should be fixed soon... If we don't get in touch with K soon...)</color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:RO635 tries to reassure SOP-II, but she herself is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. +Perceiving what appears to be a weakening in the Dolls' firepower from within the cathedral, the enemy outside lauches an even fiercer round of attacks.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Argh, this goddamned piece of crap! Can't you just do your job for once?! If you don't start working, we're all gonna kick the bucket here!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Kalina gives the comms equipment a vicious kick. The radio emits a burst of static white noise, then...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Click!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Finally. I thought you were already dead meat.</color>
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:C...Commander, we've established comms with K!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Where's this extraction point that you promised? We have nobody and nothing to aid in our withdrawal here. If you don't send in some reinforcements soon, you can kiss ⁠— not just the VIP, but also me ⁠— goodbye.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't find that joke very funny.</color>
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>;NPC-Jason(0)||:(Interrupts) You think that was a joke? +With this difference in firepower, it's only a matter of time for the enemy to breach our defense line!
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The helicopter can't land in the city.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The extraction point has been changed to a location in the delta region outside Belgrade. I'll send you the exact coordinates. Head toward those coordinates with the VIP now. An aircraft will be there to evacuate you in half an hour.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:That's impossible.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What?</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I promised Chairwoman Ulrich that I would ensure the safety of the civilians seeking refuge in the cathedral. Even if I want to take her away, I don't think she'd make this easy for us.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I don't care about the Chairwoman's wishes. Knock her out and carry her if you have to.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Our time is precious. Stick to the plan and evacuate with the Chairwoman. Don't waste firepower without making any progress—</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:—Let me repeat myself. That is out of the question. +You're currently in a safe location, which means you've saved yourself some cards up your sleeve. +If you want to evacuate the VIP, then think of a way to get these civilians out as well. +Reinforcements. Now. This instant. +I'm not negotiating.
NPC-KalinReporter(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:(Whispers) Hey, Commander. Being so blunt with him...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The bombardment goes on and on outside the cathedral. Even the comms signal is fluctuating, threatening to disconnect at any moment.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>A convoy will come and pick you up in five minutes.</color>
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Now you're talking.
NPC-Jason(0)<Speaker>K</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I will put together an operation plan. Ready your Dolls and those civilians.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Also, you're going to pay for that attitude just now.</color>
指挥官()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Humph, if I come out of this alive, gladly.
