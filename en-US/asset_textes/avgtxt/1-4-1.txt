Listen carefully.+A friendly T-Doll designated VZ-61 has gone missing and is suspected to have fallen into Sangvis hands.+She may be in possession of important intelligence, so we must recover her.+Our most pressing objective is to locate this T-Doll and launch a rescue mission.+And your job, Commander, is to scour the Sangvis command post in the area for valuable operation records.+One more thing, Commander.+Unlike those at the previous outpost, these Sangvis troops will actively seek out and attack our forces. Please be careful.
