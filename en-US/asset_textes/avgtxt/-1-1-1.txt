 ()||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><BIN>27</BIN><边框>2</边框>:Five days after AR-15 has gone missing.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...That is our latest information on AR-15, Mr. Kryuger. The Commander and AR Team are still actively searching for her.+In addition, I have approved the [Emergency Command Authority] for Squad 404.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:...You should've only given them the authority as a last resort.
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:The threat 404 faced was far more serious than expected.+Perhaps that jammer really is related to Parapluie.
克鲁格()<Speaker>Kryuger</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框><黑屏1>:Hm...+Where are they now?
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:They are currently operating in Area S06.+We'll have to wait for them to come back alive for further information.
 ()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:Meanwhile at the territory of dispute in Area S06.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Hey, wake up.+416, wake up~!+Heyyyy~~!
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_NightOPS</BGM>:Ugh...+...Shut up.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<睁眼><BIN>3</BIN><Night>:Hey! You doing okay, 416?
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:If you want me to say "I'm doing great" then help me move this rock...
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright. We have three minutes until the S.F. clean-up teams arrive, so I'll help you out.
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1><黑屏2>:(Moving rock) Do you hear that gunfire in the distance? I'm out of here if I see trouble.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:I'll twist your head off if you dare turn your back on me.
HK416(0);UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Don't be so vicious. It's not my fault that the Sangvis are prepared.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:It's only a communications jammer. Do they really need to be defending it this desperately?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:We underestimated the situation. There's a reason why Helian gave us such a high offer.
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Yeah, and this place is full of radar stations. We'll get spotted as soon as we poke our heads out.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Then let's quickly capture those radar stations since we're engaging in night battle, otherwise we won't even have vision of the area.
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I don't think we can do it with just the two of us. The Sangvis have armored units this time.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Is that so...+No wonder our bullets are useless. Can we somehow get armor piercing ammo?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45 is trying to come up with a solution, but I don't know if she has figured anything out yet...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Quit pulling my leg, 9. 45's already got it figured out, hasn't she?
HK416(0);UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Stop) Eh? How do you know...?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(2)||:Because it's been three minutes and you still haven't ran yet.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ha...♪+This is the last of them. Count yourself lucky.
UMP9()<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I'll contact 45 now. You find a spot to set up an ambush.+But seriously though, the Sangvis are gonna be here very soon. You sure you don't wanna pray first?
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Sangvis are the ones who will be praying if everything goes well with 45's plan.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>3</BIN><Night><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Calling UMP9, is 416 dead yet?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Sorry to disappoint. Tell me you're going to withdraw us now.
HK416(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't be in such a rush to leave, 416. I don't plan on losing.+I'll break you guys out. 9 will then group up with me for a new objective.+Gr G11 is gathering intel in enemy territory, so you'll need to meet up with her and act as her bodyguard, 416. We'll pick you two up after.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:(Sigh) Don't be in such a rush to give us orders when we're not even prepared to go against armored enemies.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:(Quietly) And we have to find the jammer in the dark as well...
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't worry, Helian just granted me the [Emergency Command Authority].+Griffin has also given us the authority to use equipment, so you don't need to worry about your problem anymore.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:That's great! With Griffin's resources, our squad and AP ammo problems are now solved!
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:What about our limited vision? We can't even see the enemies right now.
HK416(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We can rely on a HG T-Doll to provide our squad with enhanced vision in the dark.+Moreover, I will have our squad seize control of the radar stations to gain even more vision.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:AP ammo, HG T-Doll, and radar stations! Victory is ours as long as we have all three!
UMP9(3);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:We'll need to be extra careful as we have limited vision.+Move out when you are ready and try not to draw enemy attention.
