NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:There, all your protocols have been upgraded. +The new interface can be synced in the Zener Network using the same route. You should be able to see each other's signal now.
NPC-Seele(0);G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Whoa! What is this place?!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>;G11(3)||:Is this what the Zener Network looks like on Consciousness Level II?
HK416(0);UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>||:Oh yeah... Gr G11 and 416 didn't have modules for fighting electronic warfare. This must be your first time infiltrating the Zener Network with an analog signal.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP9(0)||:Humph, interesting...
HK416(0);NPC-Seele(0)<Speaker>Sier</Speaker><通讯框>||:With the new protocol, it is possible to increase the speed of signal emulation by harnessing other T-Dolls' computational capabilities. +Since Miss UMP45 is the leader, the control should go to you.
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:May I? Then let's get along as always in the electronic network.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:This sucks. Can I refuse?
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Let me get this straight. My consciousness is in the network, but my body is still in the maintenance pod... +So am I asleep or awake...?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>;G11(0)||:Hmm. Looks like the concept of electronic warfare is too complex for Gr G11's pea-sized brain to wrap around.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:Just think of it as dreaming. But if you don't work at it, you might never wake up again.
NPC-Deele(0)<Speaker>Dier</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45(0)||:What are you guys chattering about? Seems you've completely adapted to the new interfacing protocol. +The boss will be in contact soon. I'll have to pull you out when the call comes in.
NPC-Deele(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Then we must hurry and help the newbies get the hang of roaming the Zener Network, 9.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker><通讯框>;UMP45(0)||<黑屏1>:Okay, leave that to me!
