MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:Cleanup complete. That was the last wave, right?
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MG3(0)||:Shall we double-check? There is no such thing as too much caution.
MP5(0);MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:It should be fine. I've already done several rounds. Unless there are more Sangvis passing by...
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MG3(0)||:Um... Please hold on!+I am reading a strong Sangvis signal. It is very close!
MP5(0);MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:What?! Where? Locate it, quick!
Executioner()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:No need for that. I'm right here!
BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:Morning, Griffin.
MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>;BOSS-2(0)||:What do you want?! We won't go down without a fight!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;BOSS-2(0)||:Hold it, MG3!
MP5(0);BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:Relax. You two aren't worth my effort.+I'm looking for a T-Doll. Black hair, skull bandana...+Armed with an M4A1 assault rifle and looks like an airhead. Have you seen her?
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;BOSS-2(0)||:M4A1...? We have not seen any T-Doll by that description...
MP5(0);BOSS-2(0)<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:...+Humph. She kept running rather than to put you in danger.+I get it. So she fears my might.+Then we shall see how far you can run, M4! Hahahahaha!
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>||:She...she ran off...
MP5(0);MG3(0)<Speaker>MG3</Speaker>||:What...was that all about?
MP5(0)<Speaker>Gr MP5</Speaker>;MG3(0)||<黑屏1>:Phew... (Sigh of relief)+In any case, we are safe. Let us return and report this incident.
