PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||<BIN>240</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:56-1... Wait for me!
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Stop dragging your feet...or I'm leaving you behind.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But why are we running back?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I simply can't believe she just died like that. +So I had to come back and see if there's something we overlooked.
()||:A spent casing? Oh, it's probably from the time Gr G36c fired at the lock to open the door.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Haven't you already looked through everything?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:What if we missed something? Stop asking questions and just come over here.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Gee... +Hmm?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Found something?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Nyet, it's nothing, really. But was this here before?
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:A shell? Oh, it's probably from the time Gr G36c fired at the lock to open the door.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Come to think of it, it is a locked-room murder.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Stop saying that... It makes my skin crawl and takes away my appetite. +Is this really the only entrance to the room?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:But they were all "locked-room murder" this, "locked-room murder" that just now... +And da, this room is built along the inner wall. It doesn't even have any windows and can only be accessed through this door.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:That's strange... +I don't believe in ghosts. As long as the culprit is a living being, there has to be a clue.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:The lock has been thoroughly destroyed. It's surprisingly not sturdy for a mansion that's built like a fortress.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Don't be stupid. If it weren't sturdy, Gr G36c wouldn't have had to fire at it.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:That's a good point.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:Actually, I'd say this lock is even sturdier than the door. If it had been me, I would've gone for the door itself. +Judging by how robust it is, it could possibly take more than one shot to break it if the aim was even slightly off. +This was probably a security lock of the highest specs back when this mansion was built.
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:A lock that's even sturdier than the door... That's basically putting the cart before the horse. +It's almost as if someone WANTED Gr G36c to fire at it.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:And if you think about it, why would they go to the trouble of launching an electronic assault on MDR? +If they'd already prepared the scene so meticulously, wouldn't it be more straightforward to simply fire at her? +Or were they trying not alert us so as to buy time for their escape?
PPSh41(0)<Speaker>PPSh-41</Speaker>||:Why don't we go and ask Gr G36c? +After all, she was the first to discover the body. +We could also question her more thoroughly about the lock.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||:I just have a feeling that something's off about this lock. +I was right next to Gr G36c back then. She'd been trying to twist it open for ages, but it wouldn't budge.
()||:Type 56-1 studies the broken lock carefully.
56-1type(0)<Speaker>Type 56-1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:But I can't tell what exactly the problem is... You're right. +Let's head back for now.
