I'll catch up and follow the vehicle with her.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If we do find the "Node", should we destroy it immediately?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What on earth could it be...?</color>
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:You don't need to know. The moment you find something like it, wait for my order and destroy it on the spot.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Understood.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This channel isn't secure. I'll find some way to contact you after I catch up with AN-94.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, something isn't quite right over here.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:Acknowledged. +I'll be waiting for the two of you to contact me again, AR-15.
()||:Ange ends her transmission with AR-15.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:What happened?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Something's happening at the wall. +You asked me to keep an eye on the local garrison units in addition to the infected creatures beyond the wall. +According to my previous observations, they've been patrolling according to a fixed pattern. +But just now, some of them broke off from their original patrol routes and began to assemble at the wall.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Were they hacked by the enemy?
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Nyet... +I didn't detect any external signals. +The units that broke off are now using a new IFF signal in place of their original one. The signal characteristics...are that of the White Faction.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:"The leaves always wither after the roots rot." +So it's not just within the city, but here too...
NPC-AngeStreet(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Ange, what should we do now?
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You and M4 head over to the quarantine wall. Conduct recon and gather information there. +We'll decide on our next move depending on the situation.
()||<黑点2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><BIN>169</BIN>:...Several minutes later. +AK-12 and M4A1 reach the wall district.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Ange, we've got a mutiny here. +The defenders inside the wall have split into two forces and are currently engaged in battle. +I'm sending you the data on the situation.
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Got it, understood.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Should we stay here and continue observing?
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>...No.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>AK-12, M4A1, the two of you will now assist the wall defenders in wiping out the rebel troops.</color>
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Ange, are you sure? Using military force on foreign territory, even if it's to wipe out rebel troops...
AK12(2);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>When did you start being so indecisive?</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Don't get mad... I just want to make sure if you really want us to carry out this order. +You need to think about the consequences of doing so.
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Of course I know what the consequences are, AK-12.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:So we'll be pointing our guns at humans then, is that it?
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFFAccording to the information you sent, there aren't many humans among the rebels. The bulk of their fighting strength is made up of automaton units and mechs.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Destroy their automatons, wreck their mechs, ease the pressure on the defenders... That's all you need to do. It'll be enough.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Of course, if you have no choice, then you need to be prepared to open fire on human beings.</color>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Ange, while I don't mean to second-guess your orders, is it really wise to intervene in a firefight that's unrelated to the mission? +Isn't our aim to find and destroy the Pike Node?
M4A1Mod(3);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>This is most definitely not "unrelated to the mission", M4.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>What the rebels and the White Faction are doing is definitely linked to the Pike Node.</color>
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Why do you think so?
M4A1Mod(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's because the same thing is happening on the other side of the city.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:The peace conference, huh... You think this is a coordinated attack by the White Faction? +Even so, it doesn't prove that this conflict is more important than finding the Pike Node...
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Waiting until you have "completely confirmed" information before acting invariably leads to regrettable consequences.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You should understand that better than me.</color>
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:But...
M4A1Mod(4);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>M4, why are you so fixated on the Pike Node?</color>
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:... +I just want to complete the mission.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Although I'm inclined to agree with M4's opinion... +It can't be helped. Whatever you say, goes.
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Since you understand, hurry up and get moving.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:In that case... +Task Force DEFY will begin a new operation.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2>:...Several minutes after Task Force DEFY joins the battle.
()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...A transmission comes through.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:Eh, at a time like this...
NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sounds like you've already started fighting.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:We're wiping out a few defensive automatons while approaching the location where the defenders and rebels are exchanging fire. +Ange, if you're contacting us now... I trust it isn't good news, is it?
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Correct.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>The storm's begun, and it's driving the infected creatures closer to the wall.</color>
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-AngeStreet(0)||:Ugh... That'll make things difficult. +Given the situation at the wall now...it looks like they won't be able to defend it at full strength.
AK12(0);NPC-AngeStreet(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||<黑点1>:<color=#00CCFF>Worse still, the storm will intensify the speed of infection... Belgrade's defenders may end up facing several times the number of Infected they were expecting.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You need to move faster before the situation becomes irrecoverable!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>There really isn't much time left!</color>
()||<黑点2>:...In a passage within the quarantine wall.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:There really are a lot of autonomous units here...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:It's understandable for them to be present in such numbers in order to make up for the shortfall of soldiers.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Still, they're making our job more troublesome. +Perhaps we should explain ourselves to the defenders to clear up their suspicions about us. That'll facilitate our future actions greatly.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:...I disagree. +We can't reveal DEFY's existence so easily.
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:But if the situation remains as it is, our mission will incur additional risk.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AK12(0)||:Let me think, there must be some other way...
M4A1Mod(0);AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Some other way? Now I'm kind of looking forward to it. +Still, you'd better come up with it quickly... Time is running out for us.
