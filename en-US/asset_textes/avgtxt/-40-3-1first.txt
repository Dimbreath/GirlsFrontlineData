()||<黑屏2>:... +This is...the sensation of sunlight piercing through my eyelids.
()||<SE1>AVG_AMB_waves_and_seagulls_oneshot</SE1>:As I start regaining my consciousness, I can once again hear the splashing sea waves. +I'm too weak to move my body. My arms feel like they're being crushed by something heavy, I can't even lift them to shield my eyes from the light.
()||<白屏1>:... +What's with this feeling of déjà vu?
()||<白屏2><BIN>162</BIN><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:No sooner had this question come to mind did I start feeling something lodged inside my chest. After a violent bout of coughing, I open my eyes.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Commander, you're finally awake! +R93!
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Phew... That's a relief.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:R93...?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Commander, shouldn't you have said my name first?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Is this really the problem...?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Hold on, I remember I was just... No, what happened? Where am I?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Uh, we're searching for...
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:P38 and I are investigating a few undeveloped areas on the island!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Huh...? Oh! +That's right, we're investigating the undeveloped areas, yes~
()||:The two Dolls are definitely up to something, but I don't have the energy to dwell on that right now as all my attention is drawn to my own body. I'm in a lot of pain, as if I just got beaten up... Maybe I bumped into the reefs in the sea? +For some reason, the image of a small unidentified object flying at me comes to mind again...and the sensation of the back of my head hitting a reef...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Ow, ow, ow... Man, I hit my head hard. What was I planning to do before that?
()||:As I scowl hard in deep thought, I notice P38's face darkening.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Is...is this really okay?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>R93, why don't we escort the Commander back first?</color>
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>But then we won't have time! Don't back out on me right now!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Right, the beach. +We were ambushed on the beach by unknown enemies. We've got to hurry back... +Help me up.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:C-Commander!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Yes?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:... +The way back is a bit complicated. We'll lead the way.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Alright, please do.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:After a short rest, my strength has recovered a little. With the Dolls' help, we enter the forest before us.
()||:The terrain seems completely different from how it appeared in yesterday's investigation, and the winding path we take makes me lose all sense of direction.
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>R93, we aren't going back the way we came, are we?</color>
P38(2)；R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You think so?</color>
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>；R93(2)||:<color=#A9A9A9>The Commander looks mostly alright, but I still think we should go back first...</color>
P38(2)；R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>We're just one step away from the luck-changing treasure. I don't want to give up when we're so close.</color> +<color=#A9A9A9>By the way, I seem to recall seeing a thread with zero replies on Griffin's anonymous forum posted by a certain Doll who's good at playing beach volleyball.</color>
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>；R93(2)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Shush!</color>
P38(2)；R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Since we've come to an understanding, let's proceed according to the plan.</color>
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>；R93(2)||:<color=#A9A9A9>Hmm...</color>
P38(2)；R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Besides, all problems will be solved if we find the treasure together with the Commander, isn't that right?</color>
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>You...you do have a point, I suppose.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What is this silent conversation you're having with your eyes?
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:We're trying to remember the way back.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Really? +Speaking of which, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to traverse this terrain. Are you sure this is the way you came?
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:W-well...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Also, you seem to be a bit...hmm?
()||:As I'm about to question them further, a massive structure that's almost completely absorbed by the forest suddenly comes into view.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:We...we found it!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What?
()||:R93 is overjoyed. That's when I notice the old and soggy map in her hand.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What's that you're holding?
()||:R93 doesn't reply. She paces back and forth, referring to the map the whole time. +The construct is blocked by a wall and the main entrance is right in front of us. Beneath the moss that's grown all over it seems to be the insignia of the Military.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Strange. This looks a bit different than how I imagined it would be...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Wait, what are you doing?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:R93 mutters to herself as she walks up to the door. I'm just about to stop her when the small device on the wall emits a red laser ray.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_War</BGM>:<color=#A9A9A9>Crap!</color>
()||<SE2>Alarm</SE2>:I know very well what this means, but it's already too late. The red laser gives us a sweep and an ear-splitting alarm goes off. +We've triggered the still operational defense system.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:R93, get out of there now!
()||:At the sign of trouble, R93 stops poring over her map and runs back to help me escape. +But with a mechanical whir, a number of conveyor platforms rise up around us, carrying a large troop of autonomous mech units from underground – the very same ones that attacked us on the beach.
R93(2)<Speaker>R93</Speaker>||:Oh, just our luck!
P38(2)<Speaker>P38</Speaker>||:Commander, I think we're being surrounded!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Keep calm and send a distress signal!
()||:R93 promptly does as I say and looks at me, waiting for her next order.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:Let's hope we can get through this before they receive the signal and make their way here.
