()||<BIN>10</BIN>:【Click】+【Audio File #009】 +【Decryption complete. Start playing.】+The order has been given. You'll be transferred elsewhere. +W...what...? Are you serious?! Why?! +You know the rules... Disobeying direct orders. Assaulting friendly units. Either of these is enough to have you executed. +I just want to go where I want. How is that wrong?! +We are Tactical Dolls. It's not our place to decide where we want to go. +You must be joking! Just because I don't want to babysit that rubbish Doll?! This kind of ridiculous mission— +SLAP! 【The sound of a smack on the face.】+Wake up. +... +You're not some elite T-Doll. You're just a pathetic creature living in your own delusional world. +What are you talking about...? +Griffin will pick you up in six hours. Pack your things. +... +SLAM!  【The sound of a door slammed shut.】+Haha... I'm sorry you had to watch that. +Don't be. It must be hard on you saying that to her face. +Haha... It wasn't so bad. The next mission is gonna be very dangerous. It's probably a good thing for her to leave. +But she could have her core removed sitting out this mission. +That's true... But even that's better than just dying without a word. Compared to that, I'm more worried about you. Please apologize to 45 on my behalf. +Sure thing! Thanks for your concern, and I'll be sure to relay your message. I look forward to working with you!
