()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Flanked by Griffin troops, Scarecrow is defeated.+As Griffin T-Dolls immobilize and capture her, the operation enters the final stretch...
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Sangvis T-Doll SP65 'Scarecrow', your efforts in resistance were all futile.+Surrender immediately, and we will seize you in one piece.
()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>23</BIN>:Humph. So this is...how it ends for me...
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Just give up. Whatever you're after, it's clearly impossible now.+VZ-61 has been rescued. The information she gave you was false.
()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:False? Not entirely, I'd say.+Griffin T-Dolls don't have such advanced AI...
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...What?
VZ61(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:I know how your T-Dolls' AI is designed.+When those crudely made T-Dolls 'lie', they just throw in some random data on top of the truth and shuffle the sequence.+So even false information has bits of truth in the mix.+We just have to collect and analyze three different sets of false intel to find the common factors – the real answer.
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>24</BIN>:...+This is strictly confidential information concerning the programming of our AI. How did you know about this?!+Who...the hell are you...?
()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Just a lowly T-Doll...from Sangvis Ferri...+However, I'm not a tool that bows under human will.+Do you get it... cowardly human...holed up in your base...daring to show yourself only through hologram...?
()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Whatever. Your operation has already failed.+No matter what you know, you won't live to tell the tale.
()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...+Actually...
Scarecrow()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:...I AM telling it.
Scarecrow()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Sequence number...8354...9266...0223.+I finally calculated M4A1's coordinates at the last minute...
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:...Coordinates? What are they?!+Who are you corresponding with, Sangvis?!
Executioner()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||:...+Copy that, Scarecrow. Well done.
Scarecrow()<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:Hmm... I'll leave the rest to you.+Farewell...
Helian()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:What are you doing?! Stop!+She's gonna blow herself up!+Everyone back off! Back off!!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>3</BIN>:...Connection lost.
Executioner()<Speaker>Executioner</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good heavens... I should've warmed up to her sooner.+But at least nothing can come between us now...+M4A1, which corner are you hiding in?+We paid a huge price just to find you. You'd better not disappoint...
