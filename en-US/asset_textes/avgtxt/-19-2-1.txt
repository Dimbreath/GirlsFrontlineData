M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:How can I be calm in a time like this?!
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Don't worry. All we have to do is find a time machine.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:What time machine? Is this really the time to meme?
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:You understood the reference?

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:Ack...! +A-At least, I seem to have calmed down... more or less. +Anyway, let's get outta here first. The people here and this place are simply too odd. We'd better log off and report everything to K2.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Yeah...

DJMAXSEHRA(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||<BIN>140</BIN>:...They seem to be residents of this city. Life beneath the flashing neon lights goes on as usual despite two uninvited guests.
DJMAXPREIYA(0)<Speaker></Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||<BIN>140</BIN>:They're definitely aware of us, but nothing's happening. Our appearance and presence don't seem to make a difference.

M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:That's discrimination. You sound exactly like those humans from anti-Doll rights organizations.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:I simply can't picture it. But enough meaningless banter, it's time we get a move on.
M950A(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Where are we going?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;Thunder50(0)||<BIN>140</BIN>:Looking for AEK-999, duh. And finding out where we are. +After all, this place isn't documented in the system menu. We've gotta figure this out.

DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||<BIN>140</BIN><黑点1>:She's alone. Probably waiting for someone. That'll make it easier to strike up a conversation.

M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;DJMAXSUEE(0)<Position>0,250</Position>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait! You just threw in so many strange words I couldn't even make heads or tails of! I don't want to go to those places!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>Fairy with Rabbit Ears</Speaker><Position>0,250</Position>||<BIN>140</BIN>:Then what exactly are you trying to ask me, suspicious little Miss Twintails?
