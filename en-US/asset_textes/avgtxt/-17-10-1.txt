UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:45, Griffin's echelons will be here in three minutes.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night>:We've done them enough favors. Let's go. +This time, we'll have to get a good price from our employer. +Oh ja, 9, don't forget to clear their records of us.
UMP9(3)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><Night><黑点1>:Don't worry, I'm doing it now. +There's more people this time, so give me another five minutes and we'll be able to vanish without a trace.
()||<BIN>34</BIN><黑点2>:—Some time later. +Squad 404 meets with Ange.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Long time no see, UMP45.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:While I'd like to play along with you... +We run into incredibly troublesome things every time we meet up. +I trust this time is no exception either?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Looks like you're mentally prepared for this. +But that's the reason why you're worth so much.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:Right, enough chit-chat. +Given the huge uproar just now... What happened?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Do you know about the OGAS System?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:I do. It's the foundation of Sangvis' Doll protocol. +It's also the basis of why we can disguise ourselves as them, so what does this have to do with us?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:There'd be no need to cause such a ruckus for just a simple command protocol based on the OGAS System. +What they want is something more important than that system, something more destructive.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:And what is that?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:I still don't know. +However, you do remember the Butterfly Incident, don't you?
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:...+How could I possibly forget?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:This incident is essentially a follow-up to Operation Butterfly. +That was just the prelude. This is the real deal that they were hoping for.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:So the sacrifices they make will be of commensurate size. They truly are scum. +Tell me then, what do you want me to do?
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Oh? Someone's very eager this time round.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>34</BIN>:After all, there's something I want to take back too.
UMP45(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>34</BIN>:Your mission this time is to find S.F.'s central database and dig up as much as you can find about the Butterfly Operation and OGAS, and then find the location of Mastermind. +Work fast. We need to find her before the opposition does.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<黑屏1><BIN>34</BIN>:Got it. +We'll rest and reorg right away, then we'll move out.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:The moment has finally arrived... +I've changed, 40... +Now's the time to put an end to all of this.
