UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Too long... +Why are they taking so long...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:We can't afford to wait any longer, 45. +Their power supply and comms are coming back online in three minutes max. +Once they have auxiliary power, none of us will make it out!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We're running out of time. Let's withdraw.
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Huh? Are we abandoning the mission?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We've cleared the way. +If everything is going according to the plan, the AR Team is on standby somewhere close. They'll find a chance to make their way through.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Hey, 45! +What about the others? M1887 and her troops are still in the field.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:That's not our objective, 416.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:... +What about you, 9? +What do you think?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:I...I only listen to 45... +I don't have anything personal against the AR Team... +But...business is business, right?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I...I just take orders. Don't ask my opinion.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:But the AR Team won't agree to this. They're not like us.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:They can't say no. This is their only chance. +Either they leave with us alive, or die here with them. We can't save everyone.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Has this been your plan all along?
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Is there a problem, 416? +You yourself don't plan on staying behind either, right? +Mind you, you can't go back to M16. That "squad" no longer exists!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Let go of your pathetic pride and join us for real... +Only if we be their stain will they truly value us.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:45...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45... +The three minutes are almost up, but RO still hasn't responded...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...? Check their coordinates. They should be nearby.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:No, they're not even in our surveillance area...
G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What? Are they...not coming?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Sorry to keep you waiting, 45. +There's been a slight change of plan. +We didn't raid Architect's base and went for an outpost in the other direction instead.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;RO635(0)||:What...the hell are you doing? +Doesn't that put us in grave danger? +Once the power comes back online, we're gonna be the first to die. +Have you considered the feelings of your saviors, RO635?
UMP45(2);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't worry, 45. +Someone will be taking our place. We won't be putting anyone at risk.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...! +Gunfire behind the door!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker><通讯框>||:Dear me, looks like we've barely made it in time. +Time to clean up. Make sure you keep the dirt away from me...
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>||:Save your breath, Thompson. +I'll kill everything that gets in our way. Focus on your job.

BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM><BIN>6</BIN><黑屏2>:YESSSSSS! My power is finally back online! +Gager, did you hear me?! Now's the time to flush out the rats!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Architect! Do you copy?! +Large Griffin reinforcement incoming from behind the base! Withdraw at once! Hurry!
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Huh... +Huhhhhhhh?! Why are there so many of them?! +Hey, my lady knight! You can't just ignore your superior officer when she's in danger!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:You're strong. You'll make it out alive. +I'll meet you outside, so just get out of the base. Quick!
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Alright, I'm running! +But you hurry up yourself, 'cause I might get lost in-
()||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang!
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>||:Architect?! +Answer me, Architect!
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker><通讯框>||:Save it. She failed. +Griffin has dispatched a field commander. Their troops have already started mobilizing. +Your cannon installation drones are no match against those T-Dolls.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-8(0)||:Agent... +You found out...
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:I never expected much from Architect, but... +If you had notified me sooner, it would not have come to this.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-8(0)||:I didn't expect them to be so swift. +This is all we could do...
BOSS-7(0);BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||:This was my mistake in job delegation... +I had hoped the two of you could acquire more experience in this operation, but my plan was ruined by these trespassing rats... +Thank you for everything you have done. Leave the rest to me.
BOSS-7(0)<Speaker>Gager</Speaker>;BOSS-8(0)||:...Understood. +I am handing my command authorization to you, Agent. +But as you said, these troops are no match against the Griffin field commander...
BOSS-8(0)<Speaker>Agent</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't forget that I have my own forces... +Hundreds and thousands of units... +It is time to make your acquaintance, Griffin Commander...
()||<黑屏2><BIN>34</BIN>:Meanwhile, in the Sangvis command post.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Whoa! Why are comms down?! +Huh? Don't tell me...they wrecked the equipment?!
WA2000(0)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker><通讯框>||:Quiet, Architect. +If you so much as twitch a hair, the next thing to be wrecked is your head.
BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:... +Jeez, so the sniper is already in position? +But don't underestimate me. I can pack quite a punch!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:Really? Perfect... +I was just thinking this job is way too easy.
M1928A1(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:W-Who the hell are you?! +You have so many T-Dolls with you! That's not fair!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;BOSS-9(0)||:I'm just a lowly wall plasterer. +But I can't really start working until I see what's been splashed onto the wall.
M1928A1(0);BOSS-9(0)<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<BIN>50</BIN><黑屏2>:Fine. Happy?
M1928A1()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Oh? Surrendering just like that?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:I'm not obliged to fight to the bitter end anyway. +So long as I have food and water, I don't care where I go. +Well? I'll cooperate, so don't worry!
赫丽安()<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Capture her first. Have her completely restrained, then bring her back!
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Careful, Thompson. This could be a trap.
M1928A1()<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I've never seen any trap. All I've seen are a bunch of corpses who tried to be clever. +You're not very clever though, are you, Architect?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||:Ahaha... That's right, I'm an idiot!
WA2000()<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:This is the first time I've seen a Sangvis turncoat... +Who the hell are you? Why do you have such ludicrous authorization?
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Uh... Well...
建筑师()<Speaker>Architect</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:There must be something wrong with me...? +So please be nice to me. I know a lot of interesting things.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Sad</BGM>:... +RO635 and all T-Dolls have regrouped safely and are withdrawing to the heliport with the Commander's aid...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN>:... +You finally showed up, RO.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:... +Should I apologize, 45?
RO635(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Why should you? You were in command. +It's just that... +How is your choice any different from M4A1's?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:You mean contacting Helian?
RO635(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I mean trying to save everyone. +If the Commander hadn't listened to you and rushed here at all cost... +All our deaths would've been on you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:I think I now know... +...why you always do things your way.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Then are you content to just lose your sense of self and become someone else's substitute?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:But...what exactly is my "sense of self"?
RO635(0);UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;UMP45(2)||:I was...created for this to begin with. +I will not abandon those who M4 wants to protect. +And I will believe in those who M4 believes in.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +In any case, you did the right thing in this operation. +Congratulations, AR Team. We may not be able to celebrate with you, but surely we can have a handshake at the very least.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Of course. I also think you are all exceptional T-Dolls. +It is an honor knowing you, UMP45.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Really? But unfortunately... +You won't know us anymore very soon.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...! +What is that in your hand?!
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No reason to fear. Just a small authorization program...+...that will access your neural cloud and delete something... +...about us...
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:UMP45, so this is how...
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, this is how Squad 404 have survived this long... +Can't be helped. Even if we didn't do this, HQ would... +While we still remember each other, RO635, let me tell you one last thing...

UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Plan Parapluie is far from over... +Goodbye then, young autonomous Doll... +I envy you, truly...

RO635(3);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Frontline</BGM>:What are you still doing here?! The operation is about to begin!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||:Operation? What operation?
RO635(3);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Agent is launching a counteroffensive with a large force! We must repel them!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Repel? +Aren't we withdrawing?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Change of plan, RO. +We have to hold on until the large freighters arrive to carry that thingy away.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Thingy? What thingy?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The thingy! +Jupiter, duh!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Ju...piter...?!
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>48</BIN>:Are you...kidding me...?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I'll explain later. Agent's forces are coming!
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:The Commander is also here! +Let's have a proper brawl and bring that thing home with us!
