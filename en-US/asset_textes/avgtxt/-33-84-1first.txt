()||:【Oh, joy. I'm in such a joyful mood today.】
()||:【Why have we stopped?】
()||:【Why? Because you bunch of imbeciles can't do anything right, isn't that obvious?】
()||:【Griffin is right ahead. If we don't press on, we'll be too far behind from the autonomous forces ahead.】
()||:【I'd thought those Griffin tin cans would just drown in my network, but looks like Persica has made something interesting. The seed sown back then finally bears fruit today.】
()||:【We will destroy Griffin with our own hands. You can mind your own business.】
()||:【Hahahaha.】
()||:【What's so funny...】
()||:【You're just a low-ranking officer. Normally I would've properly reminded you the importance of being respectful to me.】+【But since I'm in such a good mood, I'll let that slide just this once... You'd better be grateful for my generosity.】

NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:But most of our echelons aren't responding... Hmm, what's this incoming transmission?
