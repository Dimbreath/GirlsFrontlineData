UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Now what? +Destroyer's broadcast is...bad news, right?
UMP9(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:The point is...how bad it actually is... +How does Destroyer know we're here? Did she come prepared or did she just discover us by chance? +And her new form...
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I think she's just bluffing. +If she knows we're here, why didn't she just call us by our names?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:But Destroyer did say she's onto our tracks.
UMP9(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What if she's just broadcasting every once in a while to scare the intruders into exposing themselves?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Huh? You mean...
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Surely you don't believe we're coming up against Destroyer on her own, do you? +That broadcast was pretty much reminding us to stay hidden. +Keep your cool. We'll only disorient ourselves if we deviate from the plan.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:So...what are we gonna do? Ignore them?
G11(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, if they still don't know who exactly we are, then we're safe for the time being.
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:45, you mentioned a small problem. What did you mean...
UMP9(2);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It just so happens that a Sangvis signal jammer nearby is severely hindering our search progress. +We have to destroy it in order to proceed.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Bluff or not, S.F. is on the lookout for us. Play it safe, 45.
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Don't worry. We've had plenty of experience removing jammers, haven't we?
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>;UMP45(0)||:Haha, you're right. That was exactly a year ago.
UMP9(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I hope we won't have to run all over the place this time...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Only I was doing the running, okay?
HK416(0);UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:There, are we all relaxed? Then let's move out.
