NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>2</BIN><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:M16, tell me what happened in the field!+I already gave the order to retreat, so why are there so many units still in there?!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:They're stuck in front of a pass, and the signal is jammed there.+There are Sangvis forces lying in ambush everywhere. Forcing our way through from either side will result in severe losses!
M16(3);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||:Parapluie is still in effect? Why didn't AR-15 leave?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:She's probably being pinned down by the Ringleader...+It's also this Alchemist's idea to provoke Negev...
M16(3);NPC-Helian(0)<Speaker>Helian</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:The cunning type, huh... My investigation failed to reflect that.+Then our most pressing mission is to get AR-15 out of her tight spot?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;NPC-Helian(0)||<黑屏1>:Yes, so we've come up with a plan just now...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>10</BIN><黑屏2><SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Commander, do you copy?+We're planning to send SOP-II across the field and into the jam.+She will direct everyone in there to follow the right route of evacuation.+But you will have to destroy the Sangvis forces on the outside to create a window for SOP-II to pass through.+Commander, the safety of AR-15, M4A1, and all other Griffin members...+All rest on you. Please complete this mission without fail!
