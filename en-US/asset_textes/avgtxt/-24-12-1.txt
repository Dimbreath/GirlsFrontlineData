SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:...What, are you regretting our deal earlier? Unfortunately, it's too late for that now!
SOPIIDamage(0);BOSS-1(0)<Speaker>Scarecrow</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>According to my calculations, I estimate you're almost at the Sangvis elite base, am I correct?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>You ought to be afraid.</color>
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:Ha, well, it's better than turning around and running into the Military.

SOPIIDamage(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;BOSS-1(0)||:... +So, what's this about? Come to congratulate us?

SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Wait— +Honestly, what the heck is she up to...?
SOPIIDamage(2);Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:This route ultimately leads to our former command post. +Even if the Commander's gone, there ought to be Dolls or resources left behind. Once we reach it, we can perform some minor repairs on ourselves. +So... can we trust her? +Can we trust the Sangvis ringleader who was trying to kill us just a few hours ago?
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Cx4Storm(0)||:No, but... we have no other choice.
SOPIIDamage(2);Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>||:If nothing else, we trust you, SOP-II.

We'll head towards that base over there. Everyone, check your weapon modes and be wary as you get close. +Pay attention to the elite units' detection range! Don't open fire without my orders!
