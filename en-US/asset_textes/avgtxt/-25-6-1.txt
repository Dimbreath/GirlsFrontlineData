()||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM><BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2>:...The rescue mission comes to an end. The group is making its way back to the base.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Are you okay, 416?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:You look even moodier than me.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I...did something terrible.
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:It was the Commander's decision. Besides...I think it's the most suitable decision based on the circumstances.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:I'm not so sure... If I hadn't made the suggestion...
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:It would be neglect of duty on your part, Miss Adjutant.
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:It's your job to provide objective insights, no matter how unpleasant they may be.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:You don't seem too bothered.
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:This is the battlefield; we're all prepared for the worst. +Of course, I'm still very grateful that you saved me and kept my "ambition" alive.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:What's your "ambition"?
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Depends. It's different every time.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:Every time?
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Every time...I wake up... +I adopt a new lifestyle based on my past memories. Do you understand?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:What an extravagant way of life, it's beyond my comprehension.
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Is that so...? But you will understand eventually. +I'll scout ahead.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:... Mk 12 walks off.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:416...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Are you trying to cheer me up as well?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I don't think you're in the mood. +But you've won everyone's recognition, haven't you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I'm not the kind of Doll who does things for recognition.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:I find that hard to believe. +I think you actually CRAVE recognition, isn't that right?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I don't know you well enough to discuss such things with you.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Then why don't you join us?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...What do you mean?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:I told you; I know something about you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:...You shouldn't. +You should also know that I am authorized to have all of your neural clouds shut down permanently anytime.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Don't get all huffy with me, I'm not scared of what you can do. +Still, you don't plan on staying while you had the chance?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:I have plans of my own. +This is just a temporary partnership. You'd better not get too close to me.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Say, you do have a choice, don't you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:Stop it, you don't know me at all.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:But I know you're not happy where you are. +You want out, right?
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...! +...416 grabs AK-74U by the throat.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker><Shake>||<SE1>Rope</SE1><SE2>Rope</SE2>:...!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You have no idea what I've gone through.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:... +4...16... +I understand...this "escape" that you've gone through...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...!
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Enough, 416.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Python(0)||:...Just playing around.
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Python(0)||:...416 releases her grip.
HK416(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:This isn't the time to joke around. Did you hear the Commander's hail?
HK416(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;Python(0)||:...Beep, 416 receives the transmission.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Python(0)||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Right, copy that. +We'll be on our way.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:A new mission?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:The enemies have shown up as expected, Strongpoint No.76.
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:No.76? But that place isn't manned at all?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;AK74U(0)||:What...?
HK416(0);AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:We're understaffed so a lot of our strongpoints are empty. What's the point in occupying such a place?
HK416(0);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Maybe they're just doing it for fun.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;A91(0)||:Don't open your mouth until you put down your bottle.
HK416(0);A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:You're in a bad mood; I understand.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;A91(0)||:We need to chase them off. The Commander said that strongpoint is too close to the extraction point. It's not good if it falls into enemy hands.
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:416, we've discovered a few T-Doll signals ahead, we need you to go and confirm them.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:Are they enemies?
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Not entirely... Part of the signal is Sangvis, but most of it is Griffin.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:What's that supposed to mean?
HK416(0);Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:Python says you'll know how to deal with it.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Mk12(0)||:Me...?
HK416(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:Why are you so surprised? +This is the reason why I ran all the way from the front to the back, looking for you.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;Python(0)||:Other than pulling the trigger, I don't know what else to do with a Sangvis.
HK416(0);Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||<黑点1>:You'll know when you see. +You're both "special" T-Dolls. I think you two probably know each other.

SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_illustratedBook</BGM>:Ah! RO, we're here! We're here! +Look! It's the safe zone! We're safe!
SOPIIDamage(0);RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What happened at HQ?! +SOP-II! If you don't tell me, don't even think about stepping foot into the security zone!
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker><Shake>;RO635(6)||:Arghhhh! My right leg is out of control!!
SOPIIDamage(2);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Shut it.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:...?!
RO635(6)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:You...you're...
RO635(6);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:What are you dawdling for? Regroup already!
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:This T-Doll... Who is she again? She looks kinda familiar...?
SOPIIDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You find too many people familiar, hurry up and get over here. +The enemy is about to launch their next attack. We must get everyone out of here before that.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Enemy? The Military already got this far?
Cx4Storm(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It's a new faction.
Cx4Storm(0)<Speaker>Cx4 Storm</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:A new faction? +Not the Military? +Not Sangvis Ferri either? +Then who are they?
Cx4Storm(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:No idea. +All we know is that they want to kill us deader than dead.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Huh...is that so? +Well, I don't mind as long as they're something I can kill.
SOPIIDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's the problem.
HK416()<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:Those things...that want to kill us... +They're...unkillable.
()||<BIN>159</BIN><黑屏2>:...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:At least they were a few hours ago. Now it's sorted.
SOPIIDamage(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:...
SOPIIDamage(0);HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Let's go.
SOPIIDamage(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;HK416(0)||:Wait, was that a joke? Did I miss the punch line or something?
