AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker><通讯框>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Ange, are you making progress?
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Is this your way of making small talk?
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:I heard that Domestic Dolls were originally designed to relieve human boredom.
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:(Chuckles) Then you've done a good job, because I feel so much better now. +Back to the subject. I've managed to work my way past the Military's defensive perimeter...
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:Ah... that's just like you, looking to throw your life away as always.
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:Oh yes, unfortunately I just can't quite seem to die. +Some bad news - the Military is starting to station tanks here. +An intercontinental train's been pre-deployed to this sector, also sent over by the Military. It's clear that they've been preparing these reinforcements for a long time.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:So they're even deploying their armored units? +Is there a need to go to such lengths for a base of rebellious robots?
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:That just means that Sangvis Ferri has something that the Military wants at all costs. +In any case, there'll be no stopping the Military once those tanks start their push.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:But it'll be a while before that, right? It'll take at least three hours before the armored units arrive.
AK12(0);NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN>:That's why I've marked a transmissions repeater station. Take it and look for a way to log in to ensure I can keep a closer eye on their movements.
AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>;NPC-Ange(0)||<BIN>99</BIN>:We'll need some time to improve the disguise of our ID signals. +Still, do you know what you'll be able to do after this?
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Ange</Speaker>||<BIN>99</BIN><黑屏1>:Don't worry, someone will be telling me what to do next. +Only thing is, she'll need some time as well.
