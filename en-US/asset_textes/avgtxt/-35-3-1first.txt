()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>81</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:... In the Griffin base.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Looks like everyone's ready. In that case, let's start gathering the presents at the appointed location! +No need to push, everyone! Line up single-file in front of me for registration!
FAL(2)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Quit shoving me, I'll turn you into a snowman if you get my clothes wrinkled.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fel the Ferret growls threateningly.
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Whoa, FAL's shoving her way forward while she's complaining!
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Careful with that cola, it's dripping on my console!
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Hey! Aren't you lot getting too excited about this?
OC44(2)<Speaker>OTs-44</Speaker><Position>0,-150</Position>||:There's dolls pushing all around me, I've been lifted off my feet...
Ameli(2)<Speaker>Ameli</Speaker>||:Uh... where am I... I can't see anything except legs...
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:Stay close, M14! It would be bad if your fire control core gets popped out from all these dolls pushing us!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Overhearing M21's words, Gr MG5's hands freeze in place. She gives them a look that is normally reserved for idiots.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Don't worry, if your fire control core gets popped out we'll visit you at the cafe every day...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Gr MG5 does a double-take, now fully in disbelief.
MG5(2)<Speaker>Gr MG5</Speaker>||:It seems S.F. has finally developed some kind of idiot ray... +M14's IQ is now on the same level as M21's. How could any Doll believe that their fire control cores can just pop out like that?!
M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Everyone, please line up. There's no need to push...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>7</BIN><黑点2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:As she watches the live broadcast from the Dinergates, Destroyer has a good idea of what is currently happening in the Griffin base.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Hehe, you stupid Griffin Dolls. +I just need to figure out how to navigate your base, and then the presents you put so much effort into preparing will be mine! +Lady Luck is still on my side, hahahahaha...+Now go, start plotting the route!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2><Night>:After receiving their orders, the S.F. Dinergates nimbly split up and head out. +One of them sneaks through the dorm corridors, computing the ideal escape route. +Suddenly, a foot presses down upon its body, pinning it in place.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||<黑点1>:Teehee, objective secured. ♪
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2>:As Destroyer watches the Dinergate getting dragged into the darkness from the live feed, all she can do is clench her fists...
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker><Shake>||<黑点1>:Dammit, dammit, dammit! +Why does Griffin have such unruly Dolls... +I need to find a way to get that Dinergate out of there...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑点2><Night>:... Inside the dorms. +ART556 places her captured Dinergate — all trussed-up like a turkey — into a repair bay.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Hehe, time to begin my perfect plan! +For starters, I'll modify this Dinergate to look like one of S.F.'s. +Then, I'll send it to the present storage area. +That's bound to cause chaos, and I can simply help myself to the presents amidst the confusion! Hahahahaha!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:As ART556 talks excitedly to herself and works with her tools, the poor Dinergate is reminded of the terror it just went through... +On the other side of the connection, Destroyer chews on her thumb and frowns. She finally manages to relax upon grasping the situation.
BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑点2><黑屏1>:Whew— good thing she only changed its external appearance. This Dinergate is still under my control. +I might as well just play along with her plan...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>81</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:... Half an hour later. +Inside the Griffin base.
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:Alright, we've finished counting up the presents! +After this, take the number you drew and find the present which matches it. +Hope everyone gets something they like~
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_tension</BGM>:Wait, what's that?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:A Sangvis Dinergate suddenly pops up in front of the Griffin Dolls. The poor, defenseless critter shivers for a moment, and then immediately runs off in despair.
CZ75(2)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||:That's a Sangvis Dinergate!
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:Go! Get it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Sangvis Dinergate darts through the Griffin Dolls' legs, nimbly avoiding all the obstacles in its path.
WA2000(2)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Ahhhh, what a pain! I'll try to flank and block it!
M1873(2)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker>||:Hold my cola, I'll help too!
RFB(2)<Speaker>Am RFB</Speaker>||:Hehe, I just cleared this map, nobody can beat me at parkour!
M21(2)<Speaker>M21</Speaker>||:M14, look! My prediction came true—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:M14 — who has been aiming at the Dinergate — loses her concentration as she compliments M21.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Well done!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The Sangvis Dinergate takes the opportunity to brush past M14's legs.
M14(2)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Whoaaaa! Did the Dinergate touch us?! It touched us, right?!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:The tiny silhouette of the Dinergate continues weaving through the Griffin Dolls, leaving chaos and shrieks in its wake. +ART556 lowers a rope down the chimney, nodding to herself in satisfaction as she watches the excitement unfold.
ART556(0)<Speaker>ART556</Speaker><Position>0,150</Position>||:Just as planned. Now I'll can help myself to the presents like the cool thief that I am...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:And so, beneath her feet, chaos unfolds...
