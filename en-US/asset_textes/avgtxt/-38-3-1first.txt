()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>98</BIN><BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:Commander? +What are you doing here? +Stay down; there are still some enemies left!
()||:Someone grabs me by the shoulder and shoves me behind a half wall. +As the guns keep firing, I instinctively press my body as close to the ground as possible. +A few gunshots from next to me are followed shortly by grunts and yaps from some distance away, then the crossfire finally seems to abate. +As my vision is slowly restored, I realize I'm still at the same hotel – or more specifically, at the same location where the hotel used to be. +I'm absolutely certain I haven't moved from the spot, but everything around me is now a scene of utter desolation; the once sophisticated restaurant has been reduced to a pile of rubble. +Rico is nowhere in sight. Instead I'm looking at a familiar face—
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:It really is you, Commander! +How did you appear next to me out of nowhere?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:SPAS? +You changed your clothes?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Huh? What are you talking about?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Maybe it was just my imagination...
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Anyway, are you here to get me out, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Well...kind of?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I'm...so sorry! I will never steal ingredients from the kitchen ever again! +Can you please end the combat simulation already? I swear I'll repent! Please, I'll do anything!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Sorry to disappoint. I also want this to be over, but unfortunately, this isn't a combat simulation.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:So it's true... +I was starting to get confused 'cuz these random enemies keep charging at me. It's already been an entire day. It's way too harsh even for my punishment...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:A day?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, I've been fighting the whole time without eating anything... +Thank goodness I'm on Level II so I haven't run out of power yet. I've been able to keep going by scavenging for weapons and ammo from the enemies.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:So you've been holding them off this whole time?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Yeah, there's no other way. +The enemies aren't particularly strong, but there are so many of them, and they keep yelling "Death to the Five Republics" or something. The whole thing is just so weird...
()||:SPAS complains as she reloads her shotgun with 12-gauge shells.
NPC-Kalin(8)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, do you copy?!</color>
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Is that Miss Kalina?!
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh, lovely. So you've met up with the Commander.</color>
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I don't actually know how that happened. The Commander just appeared with a "boom".
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>"Boom"?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's not important. What happened?</color>
NPC-Kalin(1)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Right, let's get down to business.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The thing is, I've run into some difficulty while trying to interfere with this virtual space. For some reason, I can't seem to cut off the Doll's processing power completely from out here.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>I'm trying to bypass the authorization restriction, but that's gonna take time.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I knew it. It won't be that simple as long as the subroutines are in place.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Interfere with the space? Subroutines? What's that all about, Commander?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:We're talking about how to get you out of here.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Oh...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>So I'm still in the same simulation?</color>
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, but I did manage to partially weaken the power stream, so that's probably why SPAS is now visible to you?</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>You mean she was hidden deliberately before?</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Her neural cloud is the source of this simulation, after all. SPAS, do you remember how you ended up in there in the first place?</color>
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Hmm... I don't think so... The moment I came to my senses, the enemies were already charging at me. +I've been fighting since then, until the Commander suddenly appeared next to me.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That proves my hypothesis. There's a connection between you and the Dolls, so you naturally re-materialized right next to SPAS when I meddled with the controls.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But the place got burned down all of a sudden. What should we do now?</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>With the simulation compromised, Rico must be disoriented. The operational logic of this place is disintegrating, that's why inexplicable things keep happening.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Like how a nice dream suddenly turns into a nightmare?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Exactly. I'll do my best to cut off the remaining computational support this simulation is getting ASAP. Then hopefully you'll be able to get out of there.</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Understood. Make it as quick as you can.</color>
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Wait... Watch out!
()||:While the Commander is busy talking with Kalina, SPAS suddenly notices that something is amiss and lets out a cry.
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!
()||:A gunshot.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Oof...!
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Are you okay?
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:I'm fine. +Good thing I saw that...
()||:SPAS raises her shield to show the new bullet dent on its surface. Then she raises her weapon and takes aim at a figure hiding in the shadow.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Hold on!
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Huh?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Why are you siding with the enemy, Signore Jean?
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xGS2_17</BGM>:Ri...co?
()||:The figure grows clearer. It's Rico, still in her waitress uniform. +However, instead of delicate drinkware, she is now holding a weapon. +Her expression also matches the description in the files. +This is Rico the Cyborg.
()||:There is no trace of the innocence that she's shown before. Right now, her eyes are gleaming with sheer ruthlessness. +Her malice doesn't frighten me. All I feel is the wistfulness that her happy life has been completely shattered.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Rico... Where did you get the gun?
Rico(4)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Have you forgotten, Signore Jean? +No matter what I want, I can always have it in here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Why would you want such a thing...?
Rico(4)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Wasn't it you who first put a gun in my hand, Signore Jean? +The moment I wrapped my fingers around this gun, I realized everything around me has been a farce. I have no place in here.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:I'm sorry, Rico...
Rico(4)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:Why are you apologizing? You did nothing wrong, Signore Jean. +You told me that I would always live a happy life. +I did hesitate when everything started falling apart, but then I understood – you would never lie to me. +Because now I've remembered what my true happiness is.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:What...
Rico(4)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:I felt empty because none of it was real. +The only thing that would make me happy is fulfilling your wish – eliminating all your enemies.
()||:With that, Rico fires another round straight at SPAS' forehead. SPAS quickly ducks behind her shield, which is still thankfully quite robust.
Rico(4)<Speaker>Rico</Speaker>||:I know this must be a mission. You're testing me, aren't you? +I remember you once told me I must kill whoever sees me while I am on duty.
SPAS12(0)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker>||:Commander... What...what should we do...? +I can hear footsteps. Enemy reinforcements are approaching fast.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Kalin, it seems we have no choice but to fight. Will our attacks harm Rico in here?</color>
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yes, so you must NOT engage Rico in battle!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>But it doesn't look like she'd let SPAS live.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Since the computational support is steadily weakening, her memories of this place are getting mixed up with her original memories. Like I said, her mind is in complete disarray!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Then what should we do?</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Wipe out everyone else who's trying to kill you and wait for me to shut it down!</color>
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You heard that, SPAS! Brace your shield; we have a defensive battle to fight!
