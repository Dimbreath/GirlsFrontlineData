You're way too chill! +I know the last few days have been really tough, and we did achieve some good results - we saved the Chairwoman, thwarted Paradeus, and recovered that...big metal ball... +But haven't you...forgotten about something...? +...The ELIDs, duh! Those zombies are still wandering around in the city! +Also, just an hour ago, the local military has finished evacuating the civilians to safety, so now it's just us! +Thanks to the big mess from before, lots of ELIDs have been drawn this way, which can be a big problem for our own retreat... +Still, we've always had a knack for surviving, isn't that right? +It will be no different this time. We trust you, Commander. Please lead us all out of here and we can finally celebrate the end of this whole ordeal!
