()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>167</BIN><Night>:Vector sprints through the subway station platform. After she disables the last of the rogue agents with the flashbangs she threw out, she empties her magazine in their direction.+In the wake of the gunshots, the man before her who's breathing heavily through his gas mask collapses to the ground.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:That's them taken care of...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Well done, Vivi!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>If we weren't waiting to meet up, I'd like nothing more than to rush over and help you!</color>
K5(0)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I told you, I don't want more casualties, and these guys are still manageable.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Agent, the path leading out of the train station is now clear.</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...+Dima, if the Dark Zone is our final destination, does it mean that all the enemies there will be like this?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>They're not going to give up.</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh, are they so scary?</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Er, how shall I put this... It's because a lot of unexpected variables came up in Manhattan.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>This is...well, it's a kind of force that the SHD is powerless to resist.</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:According to the game manual I read, it seems there are even more powerful enemies than this. +...Looks like I need to meet up with the others ASAP.
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>As long as we're around, it doesn't matter what kind of enemies they are!</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But the important thing is that you need to get here quick, Vivi! We can hardly wait!</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Agent, I've remotely hacked into the computers in the control room. The automated weapons along the way should have stopped scanning for hostile targets.</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>You should leave before the enemy notices something is wrong...</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I will...

()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>159</BIN><Night>:After reaching the surface through the emergency passage, the first thing that Vector sees are the fallen ruins of a tall bridge.+It forms a slope, and as she looks across the expanse, she can see the clock on the roof of Grand Central Terminal, illuminated by the ground lights.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Grand Central Terminal...
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>It's the hub of Manhattan's traffic, or at least it used to be.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>(Sighs) It all happened so fast...</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Am I imagining things, or is she being sentimental?</color>
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Even though she's an AI simulation, humans and Dolls don't experience joy and sadness in the same way.</color>
K5(0)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...If we had enough time, I'd like to help her too.
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>V-Vivi?</color>
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>You're not the type who self-inserts easily into games, are you?</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I just felt that I could understand how she was feeling...+Hm, is that strange?
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, if you sympathize with her, then all you have to do is win this tournament and it'll be the end of the game's story.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>While I don't know what'll happen to Dima in the end, we'll be able to help her by reaching the goal, don't you think?</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Now that you put it this way, I'm suddenly feeling a great sense of purpose! What even?</color>
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Isn't that a good thing? We'll use this tournament to save Manhattan too.</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You guys...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Thank you all so much. I've been waiting so long for a reliable squad like you to come along!</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>She's kind of overreacting, isn't she?</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Well of course, provided we don't run into any extra trouble...</color>
()<Speaker>ISAC</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_On</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Warning. Major threat approaching!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_The_Division_ISAC_Off</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Ah! Are you some kind of jinx?!</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Sorry, shutting up now.</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:What happened?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:There seems to be an undercurrent of fear in ISAC's warning. It is the first time Vector has felt uneasy listening to him.+As she ducks behind cover upon receiving the warning, she notices that someone has appeared in the direction of Grand Central Terminal - someone who isn't anything like the tall, bulky enemies from before. +On the contrary, the other party seems to be about the same height as herself, and she looks completely different from the other NPCs in this game.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Is that...a Doll?
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<BGM>GF_xDivision_Scene3</BGM>:...
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:I've never seen that face before.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Agent, an extremely dangerous enemy has shown up, you MUST be careful!</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Ex-extremely dangerous?</color>
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well, I wouldn't be surprised who showed up at this point. After all, the prize for winning this game is a huge sum of money.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>But if I'm not wrong, she's not dressed the way I expected her to look...</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No no no, that's not the point...</color>+<color=#00CCFF>They're much stronger than any other adversary you've faced so far, so you need to deal with them cautiously.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>Ah, of course... It would be best if you could destroy them.</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...You really want me to wipe out the other players so badly?
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>Er, how shall I explain this...</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>W-wait a minute, I'm picking up more enemies near your position! </color>
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Although Vector has the feeling Dima is trying to change the subject, it's true that many NPC enemies have appeared nearby.+Their team makeup inspires a strong sense of foreboding in Vector.
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:She must be nearby. Advance and keep your eyes open.
HK416(6)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Let's see how long this rat can hide.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Are they from the Last Man Battalion?+Why is she with the enemies in the game...
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>This is weird, Vivi. It's a bad omen.</color>
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>To hell with your omens! Wait there, Vivi! We're coming over right now to help you!</color>
K5(0)<通讯框>;Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:No, there's no need! Stay where you are and keep waiting!
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>;Vector(0)||:<color=#00CCFF>But will you really be okay by yourself?</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:...I'll need to get rid of the obstacles in the way if we're going to meet up.
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Uh, I think you might want to listen to your friends' suggestions, really.</color>+<color=#00CCFF>It might be better to get some help if you want to deal with them...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:...
K5(0)<Speaker>K5</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Whoa! R93, someone's shooting at us!</color>
R93(0)<Speaker>R93</Speaker><Position>0,-100</Position><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Vivi, we're being attacked on our end!</color>
NPC-Dima(1)<Speaker>Dima</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What? Is it them...? Dammit, why now?!</color>
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:Stay safe! Don't force it if you can't handle it!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Just then, one of the opposition spots Vector and runs over with a whooping cry.+This draws the attention of the others, and Vector is soon surrounded and viciously attacked.
Vector(0)<Speaker>Vector</Speaker>||:They're launching a simultaneous attack... Did they plan this?+...Looks like I've got a real fight on my hands now.
