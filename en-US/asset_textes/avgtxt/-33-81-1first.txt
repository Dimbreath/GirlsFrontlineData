()||:【What is it? A call at this time? Suddenly feel like reminiscing about the past with me?】
()||:【I'm not even half your age, so I don't think I have the right to do that.】
()||:【Since when did a person's rights have anything to do with age? That isn't like you.】
()||:【...How very direct of you. As you know, I've already retired. I haven't given a damn about that whole mess in ages.】
()||:【Things really have changed. The people up there don't want to be locked in this stalemate any longer.】
()||:【You Rossartrists...are way too naïve.】
()||:【But this is an opportunity, and you're a patriot who will never do anything that betrays your country's interests.】
()||:【Those brats went overboard. They have never experienced what it was like when the plague happened during the Cold War. They have to pay a very heavy price for opening a door that should never be opened.】
()||:【If that's your stance...】
()||:【Here's a warning. This country has seen too much bloodshed. Hatred and hostility won't be wiped away as easily as you'd think.】
()||:【But "do not go gentle into that good night", isn't that right?】
()||:【...】
()||:【Even if it's just a single step, someone still has to take it. I'd much rather it's a friend than a foe.】
()||:【Humph...well said. Before you give yourselves away, I won't stop you. But others in the Committee won't be so benevolent.】
