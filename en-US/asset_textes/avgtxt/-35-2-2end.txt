()<Speaker></Speaker>||<Night><BIN>6</BIN><黑屏2>:... At the main entrance of the Griffin base. +Destroyer's carefully modified Sangvis Dinergates have managed to slip in among the Griffin T-Dolls during the battle. They are now sitting quietly at the door.

CZ75(2)<Speaker>CZ75</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Hello</BGM>:Don't you see them... ? A couple of the little guys are sitting there...
KP31(2)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:I DO see them, and that's why I don't know what to do... +They're just waiting there so miserably... like a bunch of strays...
FAL(2)<Speaker>FAL</Speaker>||:Wait, one's coming over... +And it's brushing itself against my leg. This Dinergate's got good tastes.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Fel the Ferret squeaks in protest.
OC44(2)<Speaker>OTs-44</Speaker><Position>0,-150</Position>||:Oooh! I could really use their help right now.

M1903(2)<Speaker>Springfield</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Seeing as we're all in agreement, then let's keep them for now. We'll let the Commander decide later.

BOSS-6(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Don't worry. I won't repeat the same mistake.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Destroyer clenches her fist, her eyes glinting with determination.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:... Meanwhile. +... Near a chimney of the Griffin base. +ART556 stares thoughtfully at the new Dinergates, her lips curling into an evil grin.
