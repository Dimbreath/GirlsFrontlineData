()||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:...Under the city of Belgrade.
()||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang! Ba-bang bang bang bang bang...!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:More gunfire...
()||:Detecting another battle ahead, M4 slows down and listens for a while.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...I can't hear AR-15's or AN-94's gunshots. +In that case, there's no need for me to intervene. I can simply go around it.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>177</BIN>:You've grown more prudent.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:This is a rescue mission. I can't very well get myself killed as well. +Now that I'm on a solo mission, there's no room for mistakes.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Perhaps you aren't actually on your own.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I just hope you won't slow me down.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Sangvis Ferri aren't tough enemies to you since you're very familiar with them. +But the same can't be said about the White Faction, right?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I do have a general idea about them... I've received data from Ange. +I know their physical traits and how to fight them.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:But what if I tell you there's an easier way...where you can beat them without even having to fight?
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'd welcome that. I don't have the ammo to spare on unnecessary foes. +...Is there actually such a convenient option?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Of course. It isn't effective against all white units, but those Nytos... +Their construction is special... Not unlike ours, actually.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Nytos... You mean the commanders of the white forces?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:That's right. The other units' operation is based on manual input; your capacity may be relatively low, but seizing control over them from such a close distance should be a piece of cake for you. +But the Nytos are different. I can't sense their neural clouds. Those clones' neural pathways don't seem to be augmented with any kind of machinery at all.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:You're saying...they're actually human?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:More like creatures made in the image of humans. For some reason, I have a feeling that I can establish a connection with them despite the lack of a neural cloud.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:In that case, I just have to catch a Nyto and you can hack her to seize command over the White Faction.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:It would seem that the blocking device they're wearing on the head - the one that looks like a hairband - can block out all invasive signals.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Is there something special about the construction of their brain? +In any case, I need you to help me by destroying that blocking device.
()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:That's stupid. +If I can fire at a Nyto's blocking device, why don't I simply blast her head open?
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:Even if you kill one, another will soon take over her command authorizations. I'm curious about them. +If I can set up a connection, I'm sure I'll be able to learn more.
()<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Besides, getting our hands on a live Nyto would save us the effort of fighting through endless waves of enemies.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BIN>167</BIN><黑屏2>:...It could be worth a try if we've got a chance. Hmm?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:Bang bang bang! Bang bang bang bang...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Another battle...and a ferocious one. Wait, that gun sounds like...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:AR-15? AN-94 is here as well...!
()||<SE2>Runstep</SE2>:Realizing that her teammates are very close by, M4 breaks into a run in the direction of the gunshots.
()||<SE1>Select</SE1>:The moment she makes a turn around the corner, she finds two muzzles pointing straight at her.
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Don't shoot, it's me!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...M4?
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker><Shake>||:Not an enemy... Good.
()||:AN-94 lowers her gun and leans against the wall. As she starts slumping onto the ground, AR-15 dashes to her side and supports her with a shoulder.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:What's the matter? Are you hurt?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:She got shot behind the right knee. We need some time to treat it.
M4A1Mod(0);AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I can't believe I let her last aimless shots get me... It's a disgrace...
M4A1Mod(0);AN94(5)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Where is AK-12? Is she not with you?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AN94(5)||:She stayed behind upstairs to draw the S.F. away so that I can get to you first.
M4A1Mod(0);AN94(3)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:I see. It's a sound strategy. +She'll be fine on her own.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:But what on earth happened here? I came across heaps of dead S.F. and white units along the way.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I'll try to keep it short, though that might be a bit difficult.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Anyway, please try to keep calm about what I'm about to say.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2>:...M16 is here as well?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Indeed. In fact, she seems to be the one in command in the frontlines.
M4A1Mod(0);AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:She's become incredibly formidable. We alone are also no match for the various Sangvis ringleaders under her command. +Not to mention the two Nytos and the horde of white stuff that almost seem as if they can self-replicate. +I believe all we can do for now is to retreat and wait for more support.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AN94(4)||:No, it'll be too late by then.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know you have things to sort out with her, M4, but there's only so much we can do. Just escaping alive would be...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:I actually have a way to deal with the white forces. More specifically, the Nytos. +If we can take out the blocking device around a Nyto's head...
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...They can be hacked?!
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well, that is a very useful piece of information, but we're being pursued by two Nytos. +Even if we get one, the other will take over command right away.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>Clear Voice</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices.</color>
()||:M4A1 lowers her head to think. After a few seconds of muttering, she looks up again.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Then we get them both at the same time. We destroy both Nytos' blocking devices. +Don't give them any time to react.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That's too risky. Sangvis Ferri and the White Faction are now in an all-out war fighting over the Pike Node - it's total chaos. +Firing at both Nytos under such circumstances is...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:No, we can do it.
()||<BGM>BGM_Battle</BGM>:AR-15 claps M4 and AN-94 on the shoulder.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:We're different than what we used to be. +I know that as long as M4 gives the order, I'll keep up.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...Right.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:AN-94, just stay here and do some simple repairs on yourself. Also, fill Ange and AK-12 in on what's going on here. +You're our last fail-safe. We're counting on you.
AN94(4)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Alright, I can see that you've made up your mind. +But here's another question - even if you manage to take down the White Faction, what are you planning to do about the remaining Sangvis forces?
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I'll...have a proper word with M16. +If it can't be helped, then I'll settle everything by my own hand.
()||:A bright fire seems to be flickering in M4's eyes. +Is that the desire for the truth...or the thirst for vengeance?
()||:Whichever it is, AN-94 knows that she shouldn't ask any further questions...because it won't change anything.
