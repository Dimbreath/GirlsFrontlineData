HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This is 416. I've reached my destination. Currently seaching for Gr G11.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:Huh? According to the radar, shouldn't Gr G11 be right beside you?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:It's all trees here. I don't know where she is hiding...+...Oh, nevermind.+Wake up, Gr G11.
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No... I don't wanna...

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:Are you still dreaming?+You said you needed protection, didn't you?
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Oh... 45 said you might've kicked the bucket.+That's why I was gonna nap 'til after midnight and then sneak out.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Sorry to bother you while you were napping, Gr G11 ♪. 416 insisted that she came.

HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Don't get violent, 416... Aren't you here to protect me?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;G11(0)||:(Deep breath) ...This area is full of enemies. Let's find a place to hide first.
HK416(0);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Uuuu... Hold on.+I fell asleep earlier... Let me check the sound recording first.

G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I-I don't know. I was very careful.
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:How are you finding this night assault? Are you satisfied?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:This voice... Is this their Ringleader?
？？()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:...The night is still young...+But unfortunately for you guys, it will be over very soon...

HunterElite(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:Ouroboros, a sound triggered bomb has went off in point F3 of Area S06.+Based on the captured images, the enemies are confirmed to be Squad 404, but we cannot confirm if they have been wiped out.
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker><通讯框>;HunterElite(0)||:Then get closer and send out a team to ensure that they've been eliminated.
Weaver(0);HunterElite(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Are you sure? Agent has said that we should avoid conflict with Griffin as much as possible.
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;HunterElite(0)||:Hunter, it is exactly because you are too inflexible and too reliant on your experience that you got crushed by AR-15.+Listen, my goal is their leader, not these few small fries.+The point is to lure out their boss.
Weaver(0);HunterElite(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:404 and AR Team are different, though. How do you know their boss won't write them off as a loss?
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;HunterElite(0)||:Exactly because they are 404.+Humans will betray friends in times of hardship, but they will not abandon pawns while they're still valuable.
Weaver(0);HunterElite(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:Ouroboros...+Then, what about me? Why not pick a stronger Doll to work for you? Why did you rescue me?
Weaver(0)<Speaker>Ouroboros</Speaker>;HunterElite(0)||:Because you have experienced failure. You will be more cruel in vengeance, and you will be more cautious after suffering humiliation.+It is evident that you are the perfect choice against Griffin.+Now, my question to you is... Will you disappoint me?
Weaver(0);HunterElite(1)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:......+No, I will not betray your expectations, Ouroboros.
Weaver(0);HunterElite(0)<Speaker>Hunter</Speaker>||:I'll leave for the outpost now...
