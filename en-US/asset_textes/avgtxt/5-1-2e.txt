M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Sorry we are late. Where are the others?
M4A1(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Everyone's fine. You're the last team to arrive.+With that, all of us have made it back safely.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Any injured units here? Let us help too.
M16(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Sure! Heaven knows where M82 has run off to. It's really a bit too much for me alone.+Thank you so much!
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:No problem. None of the injuries are too serious. It shouldn't be too much trouble.
M16(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:True. Thank goodness they were just feeling us out with the first wave. But it gave me quite a scare when they appeared completely out of the blue.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;IDW(0)||:Then...do you have any clues regarding the weapon Sangvis Ferri used just now?
M16(0);IDW(0)<Speaker>IDW</Speaker>||:Hmm... It happened so quickly I couldn't make out anything.+But judging by the marks left on the ground, it's probably game over if you get hit.
M16(0);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:What is it, M4?
