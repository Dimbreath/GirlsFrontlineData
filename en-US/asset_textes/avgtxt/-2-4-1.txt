()||<SE2>Alarm</SE2><BIN>10</BIN>:Five minutes later, a Sangvis alarm starts blaring. 
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:The alarm is sounding! She's upping her game!
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:Keep calm. It's gonna take a while for them to get here. +RO, can you give us an estimate on their numbers?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:... +It's gonna be more than just a handful...I reckon. +But judging by Gager's command efficiency, I doubt she'd be able to mobilize that many teams at once.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:What do you mean? As in they're not gonna swarm us?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:But there's another possibility...
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:There may be more than one Ringleader in the area.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:C'mon, two Ringleaders? +Please tell me it's just a random guess.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:It IS just a guess, but we must not panic and start scrambling around. +Let's find a spot for a breakthrough before the S.F. forces have us surrounded.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:What about M1887? We still haven't found her...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:We haven't run into her yet, so she must be somewhere farther in. +All we can do is forge ahead and count on sheer dumb luck. +After all...our own safety comes first.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:... +I understand. Then lead us on, RO.
