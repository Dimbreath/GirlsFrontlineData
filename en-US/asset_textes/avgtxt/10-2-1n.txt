STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>98k, cutting it a bit close, aren't you?</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:Sorry, that took me a while.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...You wasted precious time on making a detour through the safe zone just to draw those two small fries over there...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Was that really worth it?</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:You saw right through me. I was going to tell you I got lost.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>It'd have been more believable if you'd said the Sangvis ringleader did us a large favor and self-destructed.</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:That hideout is relatively safe. As long as they stay put, S.F. won't find them. +And they'll head back at dawn. +Though I suppose MP41 will be rather disappointed.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>There's no point in being so kind...Kar.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>That kid isn't gonna appreciate what you've done for her.</color>
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:I know, but I didn't do that for anyone's appreciation. +It's time. What's the current situation?
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I have a rough idea of Gager's position, but she's constantly on the move.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>She...seems to be searching for something.</color> 
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:Find a way to draw her into my optimal range. If I don't kill this Sangvis elite with a single shot... +We most probably won't be going back alive.
98k(0);STG44Mod(0)<Speaker>StG44</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>According to S.F.'s search pattern, they'll approach this area in two hours.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Then as always, I'm going to feint an attack to draw Gager right into your line of sight.</color> + <color=#00CCFF>I really hate getting used to a new body after having my neural cloud re-installed...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>So could you please make your shot count?</color>
98k(0)<Speaker></Speaker>;STG44Mod(0)<通讯框>||:98k smiles faintly.
98k(0)<Speaker>Kar98k</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Don't worry. +Have I ever failed you?
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:...Meanwhile.
()||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:MP41 is still on standby.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||<BIN>1</BIN><Night><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:201, 202, 203... +I'm getting bored of counting the stars... Is it almost dawn yet?
()||:She checks the current time on her comms terminal.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:It's only been two hours...
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Why don't you try getting in touch with your "Fräulein Kar"?
g43(0);MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:She'll definitely think I'm useless if I contact her without anything to report...
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>;MP41(0)||:Really...? +I don't think she's ever found you to be particularly useful.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Oh right, why don't I search the surrounding area? I might actually find something!
()||:MP41 runs out of the hide site and starts studying the nearby terrain.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:(Sighs) She's ignoring me completely...
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:This location is really quite ideal for a spotter. +But according to my previous calculations, S.F. will probably be moving towards another area.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:Isn't that good? At least I won't need to reinstall from backup.
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:This won't do! +Rather than waiting around here till who-knows-when, we should head over there to have a look; we might find more clues.
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||:But didn't your dear Fräulein ask you to wait here?
MP41(0)<Speaker>MP41</Speaker>||:Dummkopf! Even a veteran like her can be mistaken. +Gathering intelligence is my forte! Let's get going already!
g43(0)<Speaker>G43</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Why...must I suffer through this...? +I'm going to submit my resignation once I get back. Even being in the service industry is better than this.
