()||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM><黑屏2>:In the end, I successfully return to Kalina's side. +While I have no idea where on earth the hospital is, I know the girls are by my side, and so...
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Commander—!
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏1>:<color=#A9A9A9>This big hug tells me the nightmarish mission is finally over.</color>+<color=#A9A9A9>And that I'm home at last.</color>
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2>:The next day, I board the transport with Kalina and arrive at our new base. +Of course, the T-Dolls of Squad 404 have vanished during the night once again. +I don't know when we'll meet again, and perhaps they don't care, but I'll remember them.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Welcome to the new Griffin base, Commander. +We have a brand-new office and facilities now, thanks to a certain unknown sponsor.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:... <c>Your new clothes look really cool, Kalina! <c>Who are they, and why were they willing to do so much for us? <c>How are Mr. Kryuger and Miss Helian?
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Really? They're operational essentials. I've been working hard and I've learned a lot this time. +The Dolls and I spent a long time getting used to the new base. Now it's your turn.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:I'm not sure, but Miss Persica also put a great deal of effort into rebuilding Griffin. +At the same time, we're going to be facing a lot of new work, so be ready to get right back to work, Commander.
NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Uh...we'll talk about it later. Mr. Havier has a slightly better understanding of the matter. +I don't believe that...the news was telling the truth...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(9)||:Ah...good morning, Griffin's most reliable Commander! +Of course, this was hardly a surprise to me. Miss Kalina told me you'd be coming an hour ago, so I've been waiting here for a long time.
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:Mr. Havier, we just returned to the base. After the recent ordeal, the commander needs rest...
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(9)||:Of course, of course, but I must still insist on taking up some of your time. I just need a few minutes, in order to keep the promise I made to "those people".
NPC-Havel(0);NPC-Kalin(9)<Speaker>Kalin</Speaker>||:"Those people?" 
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑点1>:They're big clients of Griffin, and we have to close this deal! Come, this won't take long.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑点2>:Havier ignores Kalina's protests and drags me down a long hallway and to the command room.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Congratulations on surviving...even though it was painful. +But you should know that we won't have time to rest. +By the way, do you like the new base? That's right, I'm your mysterious sponsor, but nobody else needs to know. We'll be dealing with a lot of secrets from now on, and the fewer people who know, the better.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...<c>Do we have a new job? <c>Who are "those people"? <c>Does this have something to do with Ange?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<分支>1</分支>:Oh yes. We're facing a new situation, new enemies, and taking on new work. +Commander, we need to face this together. Trust me. Only then will you and all of Griffin have a way out of this.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<分支>2</分支>:They're from the Bureau of State Security, Ange's bosses. You know what I'm about to say, right?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<分支>3</分支>:Keen instincts indeed. I expected nothing less of the trump card which even Kryuger valued so highly.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I'll be honest with you. Someone from the Bureau of State Security wants to see you. +Normally, an appointment with Statesec would be bad news. +However, what awaits you now...might be worse. +Do you know why, dear Commander?
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:Havier doesn't wait for me to answer before knocking on the door.
NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Because the person who wants to see you is the director of the bureau himself.
()||<BIN>8</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The door opens, we enter, and I see him...
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM>:The Director of the Bureau of State Security, Zelinsky.
NPC-Zielinski(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Mr. Zelinsky! See, this is the commander, the hope of Griffin and IOP!
NPC-Zielinski(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:...Zelinsky sizes me up in under a second. The look in his eyes is no kinder than the Nytos.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||:Griffin Commander, I trust Havier has already introduced me. Let's skip the formalities and get down to business. +While we were gathering information, we discovered a massive data transfer between the terminal of one of our agents - let's call her "Ange" for now - and Griffin's database. When we looked further into it, we discovered that it was Ange herself who had made that transmission. +We surmise that this data transfer contains a great deal of classified information. Do you know what this implies? 
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||:... <c>We both had no choice at the time. <c>I don't know what classified information is involved, nor do I care.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||:None of that matters. What matters is that right now, I have the authority to put you in front of a firing squad. That won't be an issue for me, from either a legal or technical perspective.
NPC-Zielinski(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:Ah...but you won't do that, Zelinsky. Am I right? +Don't worry, Commander. He's been doing this job for far too long and lost his sense of humor. Plus, he takes pleasure in scaring people.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||:This is no mere threat, Commander. My job has presented me with countless such choices and I have always made them without hesitation. +The reason why you are still alive is because we have been observing you. +I know you survived the operation against all odds and kept those secrets. +You have displayed courage, intelligence and willpower, which makes you quite valuable to us. You should serve our country and other, higher causes.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||:... <c>Is there a higher cause than one's country? <c>I don't have a choice, do I? <c>I don't care as long as I can stay in Griffin.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<分支>1</分支>:Soon you will see and understand. You and I will end up making history.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<分支>2</分支>:You can choose to refuse, and we will wipe everything away. It will be as though nothing had ever happened. +Of course, that includes the fact that you were rescued...
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<分支>3</分支>:Oh, you will stay in Griffin. Your job will not change, only some of your clients.
NPC-Zielinski(0);NPC-Havel(0)<Speaker>Havier</Speaker>||:I think...we should get on to the topic at hand, Zelinsky.
NPC-Zielinski(0)<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>;NPC-Havel(0)||<黑屏1>:I will be entrusting you with a new job, in the name of the Bureau of State Security. Of course, this is clandestine work, and we will also pay you appropriately and supply you with the information you need. +If you can live up to our expectations, perhaps Griffin's reputation as a "terrorist organization" can be scrubbed away. I trust you are also concerned about the safety of a certain someone who is currently in jail in order to protect you. +...Yes, your eyes tell me that you've already accepted my proposal. +Now then, Commander. I will tell you what your first assignment is.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:I think I already know what he is going to say...
泽林斯基()<Speaker>Zelinsky</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:The Agent - Second Class codenamed "Angelia" of the Bureau for State Security has betrayed us. She has taken valuable information and Statesec Dolls with her in defiance of orders and vanished without a trace. +This is a Code Red security threat. You know what your new job is. +Investigate her, find her, prove you're still useful to us, then we will decide what you will do next. +Of course, that's not all, Commander. +I know you've already seen all that classified information about OGAS, the Mastermind, and the Military's plan - your work is far from over. +Commander, this is a whole new set of opportunities waiting for you, but it could also be...
()||:...I know, it could also be just a whole new level of hell. +...I leave the room ten minutes later.
()||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏1>:The conversation was supposed to have lasted longer, but Havier said I needed rest. +And yes, I really do need a rest. +But some things can't be wiped away... +I have made up many stories, but there are truths which I will never know, unless... +...Unless I unearth them with my own hands.
