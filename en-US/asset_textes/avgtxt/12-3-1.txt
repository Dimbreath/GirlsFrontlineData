RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:I found the next memory fragment. Shall we proceed with the upload?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:If we don't, we cannot proceed.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Is this okay, M4? Your memories...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:It's fine, Commander. +We must hurry up and complete our work here. The Military will attack any minute.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Then RO, if you would.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>7</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_wind_grass</SE1><回忆>:M4A1 and ST AR-15 walked on for 15 minutes.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:It's getting dark and the blizzard shows no sign of stopping. Such low temperatures will affect the movement of our bodies. At this rate, we'll be frozen stiff.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I know, that's why I'm leading you this way.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:What exactly is this way?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I saw a house when I was making my way to you.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Yep...it's just ahead. There's a residential building just behind that patch of artificial shrubbery. If it isn't occupied by enemies, we can take shelter in it from the snow.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Let's scout it out first.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN>:M4A1 and ST AR-15 headed over to the bushes. +A small, simple path had been paved through the vegetation. The two followed it. +After circling around several dense shrubs, an abandoned house came into view. +The front porch was littered with children's toys, and the joyful laughter of the past still lingered in the air. +ST AR-15 carefully stepped around the innocent drawings strewn across the porch and picked up a teddy bear lying forlornly on the floor. +There were several bald patches on the soft toy. It was plain that it had been well loved and frequently hugged.
()<speaker></speaker>||<黑点1>:Noticing the splatters of blood on the teddy bear, ST AR-15 frowned.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>7</BIN><Night><回忆>:Stop. There's movement in the house.
M4A1Mod(4);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Enemies?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:We're in luck. It's a military relay station. This house is unexpectedly popular.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Let me have a look.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:See that? +Internal scans of the building are available from ten meters away. +The comms equipment is intact and functional. The station is only manned by non-combat personnel. We can use the equipment once we wipe them out.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:You intend to fire at unarmed humans?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(5)||:Armed or not, they're still our enemies. The threat they pose is in their technical expertise.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Have you suddenly developed some form of sympathy for them? +Have you forgotten how their soldiers slaughtered your Doll friends? +Or do you perhaps think that the act of killing Dolls doesn't constitute murder?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...I did not say that.
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:It's just...from the way you talk and act, I can tell...you aren't M4A1.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:Humph...
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:I've noticed something odd for a while now. M4A1 always seemed to be talking to herself...
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:She is definitely not acting under her own will! Who the hell are you?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Does that matter? +The most important thing right now is for us to survive. +More specifically, for M4A1 to survive. +I don't believe there's a conflict of interests here.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Since you agree, then let's not waste any more time on such meaningless discussion.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Humph... So how are you planning to attack?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:Hmm... I have some good news which will spare you from a guilty conscience.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What?
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:The humans in there are all infected.
M4A1Mod(2)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:All that's left are communications personnel who have lost their mind. Just send them on their way and put an end to their suffering.
()<speaker></speaker>||<Night><黑点2><BIN>6</BIN><SE2>Gunfight</SE2><Night><回忆>:Bangbangbang... +The soldiers that had partially mutated into ELIDs collapsed onto the floor. +ST AR-15 lowered her weapon upon completing the extermination.
()<speaker></speaker>||<SE2>Gunkill</SE2>:M4A1 took ST AR-15's secondary firearm and shot a few more rounds into the heads and hearts of the corpses expressionlessly.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<BGM>10230</BGM>:You need to be more thorough.
()<speaker></speaker>||:M4A1 tossed the weapon back to ST AR-15, then walked straight toward the comms equipment.
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Tsk... +What do we do with the soldiers who haven't mutated yet?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:Mutation is only a matter of time in the contamination zone. Save your ammo and just stab them in the heart with your knife. +I'll leave that to you while I attempt to hack into the Military's comms network here.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:What is it? Can't steel yourself for the job?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:M4A1...would never say something like that. +I really...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(3)||:You really can't accept me as Lunasia?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:You bastard...!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:So what are you going to do? Shoot me? +I'm out of ammunition, so you can do whatever you want.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:Don't talk like that in M4A1's voice!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:If you don't plan on shooting me, then just hurry up and do what must be done.
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Dammit...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(4)||:Don't you think even you are behaving differently than the old ST AR-15?
M4A1Mod(0);AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:What...?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>;AR15Mod(0)||:The old ST AR-15 would execute her missions ruthlessly. She would also hold Dolls who lack such resolve in contempt.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:Whereas now, all I see is weakness. +Or were your strength and ferocity all just a show you put on for Lunasia's sake? Are you actually a cowardly and incompetent Doll all along?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<震屏>:Say that again?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||:Am I wrong? So you're just going to let those soldiers suffer in pain, not to mention turning a blind eye to the risk of their aggression in the final stage of their mutation. +Lunasia's rifle is completely empty. If we find ourselves in danger, you're the only one who can return fire. +Or are you so confident that you can protect her from harm even without your weapon?
AR15Mod(4)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Alright, enough! +Just shut it!
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:I...I'll do it, okay?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1?</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I honestly have no idea how you all managed to make it this far... +When you're done, stand guard next to Lunasia while I connect onto Level II. If I can find Griffin or Ange's location, there might still be some hope for us.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><黑屏2><BIN>202</BIN><关闭蒙版>:Uh...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:How surprising...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:I never thought Dandelion would give 15 such a thrashing!
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:I...I was just too high-strung to rebuke her!
AR15Mod(3)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Also, she said all that in M4A1's voice, it was too disorienting for me to react!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So...you didn't defend yourself only because it was M4A1?
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker><Shake>||:W...what's wrong with that?!
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:From my observation, the AR Team's actions are easily swayed by their emotions. Their efficiency leaves much to be desired. +If it weren't for their exceptional specifications, they would've perished in battle more times than I could count.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:But this is also what makes them more than simple killing machines.
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:Tactical Dolls exist to kill. Whether their targets are machines or living lifeforms is beside the point. +Going by your logic, a kitchen knife shouldn't be optimized for cutting up vegetables. +No matter how you try to justify it, the truth is that humans are leaving all the dirty work to Dolls.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:...
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:It's nothing to feel ashamed of. After all, "whatever is reasonable is true, and whatever is true is reasonable." That's the rule we all play by. +The way I see it, a Tactical Doll that can't kill would be more useful working as a barista in a café. +Showing mercy to your enemies is a sign of incompetence in humans and T-Dolls alike.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:You don't have to worry at all! The Commander has never shown mercy to our enemies!
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:According to Griffin records, you do seem to have a consistent habit of sparing no one. That, I find very reassuring.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||:Somehow that doesn't feel like a compliment at all...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Ahem... Can we save the chit-chat for later? I'm having some problem with the transfer. A little help, please?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||:A memory fragment has merely got stuck in the middle of reloading. That can easily be resolved on Level II.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Don't just let me do all the heavy-lifting! Aren't you supposed to be going through the memories with me?
NytoIsomer(4)<Speaker>Dandelion</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Fine, I'll help. Hurry up and clear away the irrelevant content.
