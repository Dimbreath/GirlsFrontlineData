Her whereabouts are currently unknown.+This T-Doll, suspected of being infected and controlled by Sangvis virus, is highly dangerous.+On top of that, her communications module has been deactivated, so we are unable to trace her electronically.+All field commanders listening to this broadcast, please launch an immediate search for this T-Doll.+The moment you spot her, inform High Command and put her under control as soon as possible.+If the situation calls for it, you have permission to attack or destroy her.

M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:M4, what did the commander say?
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M16(2)||:No matter what, find AR-15 first.
M4A1(0);M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:True that. SOP-II, tell her what you just found out.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;M16(2)||:Okay... I've located Destroyer's newest coordinates using the information we collected.+Since we haven't reported our findings yet, we can get there before anyone else.
SOPII(3);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Destroyer? What good does it do to locate her?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:M4, do you think AR-15 is really under Sangvis control?+Don't you think there's a possibility that she fled of her own accord because there is something she absolutely has to do...
M16(3);M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...AR-15 wants to find Destroyer and...avenge herself?+But...as an T-Doll, how could AR-15 disobey Griffin's orders for her own desires?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;M4A1(2)||:M4...+I know AR-15 better than you do. Or should I say...I know the AR Team better than you do. By far.+One day you'll understand, but not today.
