()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>55</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:...Several battles later.+In the S.F. base.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Hmph, these are what you call upgraded units?+They fell so easily.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>;Welrod(4)||:Welrod, we're almost there. Alchemist...should be inside that bunker up ahead.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Yes...+The one who spread this terrifying evil has come out to welcome us.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Spitfire wrinkles her brow and looks forward. Alchemist is standing at bunker entrance with a cold smile on her face.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Welcome, little mice. Would you like to take a rest first?
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Surely you jest. That was nothing more than a warmup.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Eavesdropping on your transmissions was really quite amusing. I didn't think you'd come here at the behest of that lump of scrap.+This is truly...laughable.
Welrod(4)<Speaker>Welrod MkⅡ</Speaker>||:Our mission has always been the extermination of Sangvis Ferri.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Oh? What a grand statement; the Griffin Dolls in my memories said similar things.+And one could also say that...you inferior Griffin Dolls haven't improved even after all this while.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:Heh, that's not for you to judge.
BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:What are you if you're not inferior Dolls?+You lot... You probably don't even know what thinking is, do you? Haha...you actually thought that a human sickness could spread to Dolls, and blamed ME for it? Hah!+Well, you deserve it. You're nothing more than scrap metal that should have been cast aside by the passing of eras. I wouldn't be surprised if you were in fact infected by some idiocy disease—
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_pistol_finalshot_n</SE1>:Bang!+A gunshot interrupts Alchemist's taunting speech.+The bullet seems to cut through Alchemist's hair. Her strands of hair follow a somewhat unnatural arc before settling down.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||:You shut your dirty mouth!+If you insult big sis 75 one more time... If you keep insulting my dear comrades, I'll tear that mouth of yours to bits!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Alchemist says nothing. She simply steps back, and her laughter grows wilder and wilder.
Spitfire(2)<Speaker>Spitfire</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It doesn't matter whether you're responsible for what happened or not, we'll find out once we kill you and bring you back to the base to pick your brain apart...+Now die!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><Night><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Halloween. At night.+In the Griffin base.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Like a little bat, P7 darts between the shadows of the buildings.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Don't tell me ghosts really do appear on Halloween...+Even though it didn't sound like it came from a bad person, that encrypted transmission I got out of the blue was too spooky...+Hey, stay behind me! Don't let anyone else spot you!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 commands the Dinergate beside her with a whisper before carefully inspecting her surroundings. She starts moving again and darts into another patch of shadows.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Ah, there's another security camera up ahead.+The encrypted transmission told me to check the base's security cams, which kind of makes sense.+...Although I can't access certain monitored areas, I did notice some weird things in the security footage from the previous location...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 looks around to check if she's being watched, then she orders her Dinergate to connect to the security camera high above them.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Alright, the data's downloading.+Hehe, turns out I've got a hidden talent for being a secret agent. I need to show off my skills to the Commander once I'm done with this whole thing...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:While muttering to herself, P7 opens her tactical tablet to check the footage from the previous location.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:How weird, how weird... It feels like the base has been cursed today. +Huh, this video clip is... FF FNC escaped from Vector? You big dummy! Why are you stealing from the same warehouse again! See, now Vector's chasing you again... +Huh? How come m45 is getting captured too? Didn't I see her trying on makeup with a Doll that had a knife through her head...? Wow, P90's really vicious. She's taking m45 away just because she got a bit of makeup on her... +And what's going on in this corner? +Oh my, Gr Mk23 is sitting down and crying while firing her gun in every direction! Good thing I'm nowhere near her... +Hm? What is she saying? Let's zoom in... Judging by her lips, she seems to be saying "I want to see the Commander, let me see the Commander"... Hehe, dream on, I wouldn't be scurrying around like a thief if I could see the Commander too.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 is so absorbed in watching the footage that she doesn't notice her Dinergate has already finished downloading the security data and has walked up beside her. +The Dinergate, in its miniature pumpkin disguise, looks at P7 before stepping on her shoe to get her attention.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<震屏><黑点1>:What the heck? Watch where you're going!+...Uwah! What am I doing getting excited over this stuff again!?+Time to work, time to work! Let's see, the next security camera is over at... Ah, I can't enter that area. Nothing I can do, then. Let's look for a place to watch the footage we just downloaded.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点2>:...Fifteen minutes later.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<震屏>:Uwah—!+My instincts were correct! No wonder I kept feeling that someone was watching me all afternoon.+This Doll is... Darn, she's moving too quick in the footage, I can't make her out...+Also, something is weird with this footage. It's all choppy and intermittent, as though... As though...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 scratches her head. The word is right on the tip of her tongue, but she can't quite put her finger on it.+The Dinergate looks up at P7, and its camera lens makes a mechanical whir as it opens and closes.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Oh, that's right! It's as though there was some kind of signal interference!+Dinergates have the same issue when drones are nearby... Oh, drones!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 fast forwards through the security footage again several times.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hehe, I knew it...+There were so many drones in the base today, but...what exactly does this mean...+Let me inform that mysterious signal of the situation first...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><黑屏1>:In these few short hours, P7 has exhibited caution and focus to a degree that she has never shown before.+Loud footsteps were to be avoided, and drawing others' attention was equally dangerous.+From time to time she grumbled in her heart...+"If only I could use my minimap to see which direction the enemy is looking from!"
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BIN>83</BIN><黑屏2><Night><黑屏2>:Hmm... I haven't been spotted yet, right?+I must not get caught. I must not run into an infected Doll. I don't want to get infected. I don't want to die...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Beep—
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:They replied! Let's see...+Hm? Go to the command center and access the main security terminal to obtain the Dolls ID data to construct a holographic map of the paths taken by each Doll today?+D-Do I really have to go? If the Commander were to find me poking around in the command center without permission, I might get scolded...
P7(2)<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 chews on her sleeve as she thinks about it for a moment.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Fine, let's do it! We'll cross that bridge when we get there!+Besides, in all likelihood, the Commander probably wouldn't even notice me... Hehe...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>97</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><Night>:In front of the command center.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:Whum— Whum—!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After a long, hard journey to the command center, P7 finds herself panicking in front of the door.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<震屏>:How could I have set off an alarm?! I barely touched the door!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:P7 is so flustered she doesn't know where to hide her hands. Suddenly, her communicator starts ringing.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What are you doing sending me a message at a time like this? Come and save me—+What? The base's internal security has been beefed up due to various reasons, so in order to access the security terminal, I'll have to...force my way through?
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>||:Come on, what kind of joke is this? Are you really telling little old me to force my way through?
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Freeze!+I've got you now, you sneaky little thief.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Uuu...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 reflexively puts her hands up, and in the next moment she suddenly remembers something and pulls her hands back down before stiffly turning to face the voice behind her.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Your hands... You're an infected Doll!
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker><Shake>||:No, no, I'm not!
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:No drunkard would admit to being drunk. Your words are unreliable.+What are you doing standing around so suspiciously, little miss?
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:I-I... Transmission...!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7 is briefly at a loss for words, as though all the data in her neural cloud is jammed up.+"I must not get infected... I must not die..."+These are the only recognizable thoughts inside P7's head.+Standing in the corridor outside the command center, which is intermittently lit by red flashing lights, P7 speaks without thinking—
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:I need to get into the command center! Or else we'll all be scrapped!+That mysterious transmission...is destiny... That's right! God sent me here! Everything will be sorted out if I can get access to the data I need!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:After listening to P7's appeal, KSVK slowly puts her gun down and eyes P7 suspiciously.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:I'm sorry, are you talking in riddles?+Everyone's going to get scrapped? And God sent you here to...trigger the alarm?
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:No no, the transmission told me to break in... 
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Excuse me, but... +Would you happen to be referring to Mr. <color=#4EFEB3>God Jackstar, the Unfathomable Abyss, the Dancing Stardust of Sagittarius, the Blazing Inferno of the Frozen Hell, Second Principal Leader of the Incomplete Brigade"</color>?
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:Hah? What abyss? Jackstar? +Call him whatever you want, but I need to get inside the command center!+Urgh... Could you wait until I sort things out before you detain me... Although I'm truly not infected, uuu...
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:KSVK knits her brow and mutters to herself. 
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Hmm, this might have been ordained by fate... +I didn't expect to meet a fellow believer in Mr. <color=#4EFEB3>God Jackstar, the Unfathomable Abyss, the Dancing Stardust of Sagittarius, the Blazing Inferno of the Frozen Hell, Second Principal Leader of the Incomplete Brigade"</color> in a place like this... +Yes, this must have been planned by destiny. I see, I see, so this is the reason for my existence here...
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||:What the heck is she talking about? I feel like only Miss Welrod would understand her... And do these delusional Dolls even have a hearing module installed?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:Just as P7 is muttering to herself, KSVK suddenly walks toward her with a slight smile. +P7 promptly tenses up again.
KSVK(4)<Speaker>KSVK</Speaker>||:Little miss, I am truly happy to come across you here. When I was posted here for temporary patrols, I had the feeling that something would happen, and perhaps you are that something.+Leave this measly alarm to me. Once we finish here, we can take our time to discuss the teachings of Mr. God Jackstar!
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:P7's neural cloud is still jumbled up, and she did not anticipate the situation to turn out like this.+However...this development suits her just fine.
P7(2)<Speaker>P7</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Y-You're going to help me deactivate this alarm?+I... You... Ah, whatever, let me give you a hand!
