()||<黑屏2><BIN>99</BIN><Night>:...All combat has concluded.
()||:...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:The Griffin T-Doll signals we detected are just ahead, but there are many of them... +Could they be...reinforcements?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I never asked for them. +Stay here. I'll go and have a loo⁠k—
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Oh oh oh oh ohhhh! +Miss Thompson! We finally found you!
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Huh? T65...? +What are you all...doing here?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Miss Thompson... Let me explain...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It isn't safe here. Tell me everything as we make our way back to the safe house.
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>70</BIN>:Filming...with a fake Miss M16? +How puzzling... Isn't the search and rescue still going on?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:It's actually quite understandable. +Now I finally know what AK-47 was so hung up about even as she was being loaded onto the chopper. +Now, a Plan B... how very typical of you, Garand.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Many...uh...unexpected things...have happened tonight...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:<size=35>Yeah, even making it here in one piece was unexpected.</size>
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:I never thought you'd actually cross such a dangerous zone like this. +Is this really so important to you?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:... +Yes, this is something we must do no matter what. +But why are you still here...? Haven't AK-47 and her squad already been evacuated?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We all have things we must do - "no matter what". That's all there is to it.
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Garand... We really can't help you... +Captain here has to spend the whole night—
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:We can finish by daybreak, and I can dress up as M16. +What exactly do I have to do?
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Huh? But—
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M14(0)||:If we were back at the base, I'd probably refuse. +However, they wouldn't give up even though they had to take such a massive risk, then we have no reason not to help. That's one of the rules.
M1928A1(0);M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:But what if a signal with a matching identification appears while you're distracted by other things?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;M14(0)||:We'll do what the situation calls for. +In any case, our job is essentially "to sit and wait", so this extra task won't get in the way. +Garand, does what you plan on shooting involve loud noises?
M1928A1(0);m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Not at all. We only need to film a short and simple dialogue...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>;m1(0)||:Good, then let's begin ASAP. +But we must stop at once if anything happens out there, understood?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:S-sure, that's perfectly fine!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Oooooooh, Miss Thompson!!!
M3(0)<Speaker>M3</Speaker>||:Hush, please keep your voice down, Miss T65!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:What a surprise... +I can't believe we've made it this far...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||<黑点2><BGM>GF_Memorial</BGM>:Hmm...I've seen M9 playing with this kind of thing before... +But it's still pretty incredible how convincing the makeover looks even from such a short distance.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Yeah...it's almost like magic... +It can even turn me into Miss M4...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:Amazing! +With this, you can change your face all the time!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:<size=35>There are actually simpler ways to change a Doll's face, you know...</size>
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Now it's Miss Thompson's turn! +Hurry up, Garand!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Let me run through all the tools and materials I need first. I'm almost done...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:No rush, I'm not going anywhere. +... +Sigh... I didn't expect to see M16 again in a mirror...
M14(0)<Speaker>M14</Speaker>||:...
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Let me see...I have most of the things I need here. +Miss T65, do you still have the box I gave you before we set off?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Box? +Oh, that, of course I... +...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Miss T65? Why have you stopped moving?
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Oh boy...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>:This is strange, where did the little box go...? +Wait a minute, it should be in this pocket!
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:Maybe you dropped it in our last battle...?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:No way! +It's got to be with me; I just don't know which pocket it's in... Where is it...? Where is it...?
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:What's in the box?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Some small parts. +But they're part of Miss M16's gun as well as her case. +Now we've lost it...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker><Shake>||:No, we haven't! +I'll find it for sure! Maybe it's right outside the door...
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Isn't that what "lost" means?
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<震屏3>:Shut up, dumbo!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Calm down, Miss T65. +Even if the box is lost...it-it doesn't matter too much. +There's no need to be so nervous.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Arghhhhhh! +Garand...please tell me you have a Plan C...
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:... +Of course I do, so don't panic.
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Then what do we do now?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Let me...think... +Uh...
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:It's all my fault... It's all because I wasn't careful with the box...
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:You should just pick a random spot on the ground and dig a hole. +Who knows, you might find something you buried there in the past and it could come in useful.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>;T77(0)||:This isn't the hill near the base! +Who'd bury extra parts here?!
T65(0);T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:Then we're out of luck. Make do with some of the styrofoam and wooden boards lying around. +We're not as effective without T91, but we can probably still make something out of nothing.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:We don't even have black paint! There's no way we can pull this off!
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker><Shake>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Arghhh, it's lost... There really is no finding it... +What do we do...? We can't just go and steal some of Sangvis Ferri's parts now...
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Pervaded</BGM>:... +That's it!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...Are you for real?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>||:Those small parts are all of common specs – even Sangvis Ferri uses them. +There are so many Sangvis remains out there, I'm sure we can find something useful.
m1(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:... +In other words, you're all going outside?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:Just foraging for a few small things. It won't take too long.
m1(0);T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:No, I'll go! +You should stay here and handle the other filming stuff.
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>;T65(0)||:But the parts...
m1(0);T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||:Just tell me what we need. +I'm the one who lost them, so I'll fix this! I can't make any more trouble for you!
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>;T65(0)||:That's not the issue⁠—
m1(0);M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Is this really the time to argue? +Garand, is there nothing else for you to do apart from finding the parts?
m1(0)<Speaker>M1 Garand</Speaker>;M1928A1(0)||:No...there are still a few things to prepare...
M1928A1(0)<Speaker>Thompson</Speaker>||:Then what's the point in giving yourself even more work? Just tell T65 what parts to get. +T77, M3, you two go with her in case anything happens. Make it quick.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>Actually M3</Speaker>||:...Huh? +Oh, roger that!
T77(0)<Speaker>T77</Speaker>||:...Let's go, T65.
T65(0)<Speaker>T65</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:It's just dismantling some parts. How hard could that be?! +We'll be right back!

Thompson()||<黑屏1>:Garand, I need to have a word with you.
