()||<BIN>10</BIN>:【Click】+【Audio File #006】+【Decryption complete. Now playing.】+What...is this place? +The Ministry of National Security. +Looks like we've been temporarily assigned here for the operation... +Nervous? We're in an unfamiliar environment after all. +Hmm... everything feels so harsh and cold here, though it's not really that different from Griffin... +Haha, but then again this is so much more luxurious. Oh, hold on. I'm receiving new directives. +Ah, commander, here you are. +Connect to ports #3, #5 and #18 for identity authentication. +Roger. Identity authenticated. +HQ has ordered the two of you to delete all operation records from your time in Griffin. +Huh...? Is that really necessary? +Shush, 45... +That's an order. Do it at once. +Yes, sir. +Yes, sir... +Second directive, you are to install the confidentiality safeguard program issued by the Ministry. The file has just been sent to you via port #18. +Roger. Installing. +After all Griffin authorizations have been purged, redirect your command authorization to me. +Yes, sir. Applying for the security certificate from Griffin. ETA in 30 minutes. +Everything is so clunky with Griffin tech... Report to the training room after you're done. Unauthorized connections are prohibited here, and all communications must be made verbally. +Understood, Commander. See you later. +He's gone... Confidentiality safeguard program? I have a bad feeling about this... Have you ever heard of such a thing? +To prevent a leak, it can seal off and even delete a T-Doll's memory. Under extreme circumstances...it can also completely fry the neural cloud. +That...scary? +It's for the sake of keeping their intelligence safe... It can't be helped if the mission really does call for it. +By the way, only I have to redirect the command authorization to the new commander. We'll then share the authorization. +What do you mean? +You redirect yours to me, so you won't answer directly to the commander. We can then set up an internal link to communicate our orders. +Huh? But then...I'll be without a commander. +They probably won't be sending us on tough missions anyway. This will also save you some space. +I don't personally have a problem with this, but what about the commander? +Don't worry about it. This is to ensure better performance. I'll explain it to him. +Okay... I trust you.
