M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:RO, by "getting some help from this city"...you mean hacking into their surveillance cameras??? +That's just a common trick...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Common, which is another way of saying classic. +Cities in the Green Zone have a relatively high level of security. These cameras can significantly widen our search parameters. +I've synced with similar systems back in my law enforcement days. It wasn't exactly a city, but these systems are all more-or-less the same. I should be able to access some of their data with my new modules.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:That said...shouldn't we find somewhere more covert? This square probably isn't the best place for espionage.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:This place has the most Level access ports according to my scans. I can't keep up the breach for too long and I'll need a very stable connection. It has to be here. +From now on, my consciousness will have to remain on Level II. I'll be going through all the footages in the past week, watching out for every single detail. +Everything happening out here will be up to you. Remember – keep a low profile, stay away from the people around us, and don't cause any trouble, okay?
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;RO635-NoArmor(0)||:Alright, we're just two Dolls sitting on the square watching three electronic Persian cats brawling with a real Shiba Inu. Neither S.F. nor the white weirdos are around, so there are no fights for me to pick.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0);RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sigh...just be good. We'll get busy soon enough... +I wonder how my electronic warfare module is going to render the Belgrade database... 
M4 SOPMOD IIMod-Noarmor(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Resume your journey in Wonderland. I'll keep an eye on things out here.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<白屏1>0,0.5</白屏1><CGDelay>0.3</CGDelay>:...RO635 executes a command and her electronic warfare module starts generating the virtual environment.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<白屏2>0,0.5</白屏2><BIN>72</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:How long...will my consciousness be in this free fall...?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:...The world around her is changing constantly.
()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>0,6</黑屏1>:Will I fall to the other side of the world? +Oh...Alice, Alice, do you still remember who you are?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2>0,6</黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN>:...Thud! +RO's mental form suddenly reaches the ground.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:Great, safe landing. +However...things are gonna get dicey from here on out.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:?? +Warning. Warning.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>72</BIN>:...A chaotic electronic cognitive entity approaches with its weapon raised.
()<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:?? +This sector is in lockdown. Intruders are not welcome.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<SE2>MachineGunBurst</SE2>:...Bang! +RO shoots straight into its core.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Sure, why else would I be here?
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑点1>:She observes her surroundings carefully.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:These enemies are generated by my EW module after processing the data... In other words, this is how my neural cloud interprets the firewall system. +They look a bit too odd so I guess I'll just overlay their appearance with enemies I've encountered in the past. +To get inside, I must evade them whenever I can and eliminate them if it comes to that. Once I'm in, I'll have to trawl through the records as fast as I can.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||:As RO detects more incoming electronic guards, she wastes no time and camouflages her signal.
RO635-NoArmor(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Right... You've got this, RO. +This is no different than what I did in law enforcement, even though it's technically illegal this time. Still, it's for completing the mission...and for the sake of justice... +No matter where our informant is hiding, I must flush him out!
