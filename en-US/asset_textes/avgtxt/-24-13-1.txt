At this rate, the data specifications of this girl can probably be used as the template for the third generation of Dolls. +She will protect M4A1, not because she is ordered to, but because she admires and respects M4A1... +While this will all be the product of previous planning, aren't "emotions" basically playing things by ear anyway?

M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:She didn't do anything at all! +She was the only one seriously crying, and the loudest one as well. She kept saying, "It's my fault, it's my fault, I'm sorry!" +She was just like a bullied kid I once saw in a movie.

M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:Yeah... ■■, why do you think we have emotion modules?
RO635()<Speaker>■■</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:About that...
M4 SOPMOD II()<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<边框>2</边框>:I once posed this question to M16. She said perhaps it is to prove that we aren't simply killing machines. +We possess emotions, so we're different from those cold, emotionless Military Dolls... +But there are those who say that our emotions are what makes us defective and weak. +So what do you think? T-Dolls have emotions... Does that make us defective?
RO635()<Speaker>■■</Speaker>||<黑屏1><边框>2</边框>:I don't know... +But emotion modules are something that humans gave to us. No one would intentionally make their own products defective, right? +So...there must be some meaning to all of this.
