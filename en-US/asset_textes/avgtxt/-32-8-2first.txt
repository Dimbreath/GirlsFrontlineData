()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>m_va_reminiscence</BGM>:...Some time later.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:...+ She's gone... +Alright... +Let me think over...what the hell happened tonight... +A Doll from Griffin got drunk and then the entire bar and the entire world was thrown into chaos... +And I'm still stuck in this godforsaken place... +Who else is going to show up next? But still, no matter who it'll be, it can't possibly be any more confusing than what I've already encountered tonight. +Dammit...this is worse than the time I had to entertain those dogs...
()<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Good evening...
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Good evening, welcome to— +...+What the f...
Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hi, Jill.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>186</BIN>:...
Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:We...meet at last.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:...+ You've got to be kidding me, you have GOT to be kidding me!
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Can...you please calm down? +I know this appearance of mine is a little embarrassing.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Embarrassing? +I've been alive for 27 years. This is the first time that I have ever wanted to kill someone, and that someone is myself!
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>???</Speaker>||:Jill... +I'm not you, do you understand? You can call me Julianne. +And you're just looking at a 27 year-old woman who looks exactly like you, cosplaying the female lead of your favorite anime from when you were a kid. That's all.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Julianne... That's a word I only hear once in a blue moon during my calls back home. +In any case, seeing this is kind of...strange. +Perhaps I might really have done this in some other world, dressing up like this in order to have people take pictures of me at anime and manga conventions... +All I can say is...wow...who knows, I might have been happier that way. +So...you're me...from another world?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Not entirely. +I am Jill Stingray from another world, but during my journey...I travelled a long time while passing through the gate. +Long enough that...I've experienced many things, so I'm not really "Jill" anymore... +Perhaps right now, I'm closer to being your future.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:If I knew I would end up dressing like a Model Warrior in the future, I would find a time machine to kill myself.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:That's fine. Once I leave this room, you and I will forget everything, and anything that happened while I'm here will be wiped away.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Sounds like that means nothing will matter, but I'm already used to that. +So...how have you been, Julianne Stingray?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:I... I've been very well... +In my world, things have gone swimmingly. +I spent 15 years with a ghost and built a bar together, and I served many cool customers. +We've done many things over the past 15 years... I don't know whether it was right or wrong, but we just wanted to make the world slightly better.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Sounds like you had a very fulfilling life, Model Warrior. +Not like me...not like me at all... +So did you get married?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:No.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:God damn, thank heavens for that! +Even if you saved the world, you couldn't solve all the problems in your life, right?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:I don't consider that to be a problem. +Our world is about to end, and everything will be destroyed. I'm not going to feel depressed because I don't have someone that belongs to me... +I didn't even have the time to carefully count out what I've lost. I certainly won't care about something I never had.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Looks like your problem is way bigger than any of mine.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:We simply know the scope of our problem. +The problem you're facing is more challenging...because you don't know where the problem lies, or whether if it's even a problem in the first place. +Perhaps this is just a perfectly natural state of affairs? You should accept it.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:No, I shouldn't think that way... +I'm sorry, if I had been more decent, perhaps...I should have never encouraged that Doll to drink something she couldn't handle.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Then our world wouldn't have existed, Jill. +Even in the real universe, there must have been some tiny error that led to the Big Bang, right? +Errors, problems, accidents, those are the beginning of everything, and our encounters must surely be the same way...
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:So I can't...take it back a little? Make everything seem a little more orderly?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:...Can you give me a drink, Jill?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Certainly...what do you want?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:A Zen Star.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Are you serious?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Would I joke about a Zen Star?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Alright, here, you asked for it.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:...Have you tried one before? It's balanced, rich, and completely satisfactory in every way, but it tastes horrible. +You can't drink a cola while eating cotton candy. You won't taste anything that way. +Some things hurt no matter what choices you make. Sometimes, choosing isn't even important. The important thing is that you made a choice, and now you have to live with the consequences.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:...+ So we deserve this, right? Whose fault is it that we're still alive?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Do you want to be a better person, Jill?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:I do, of course I do. +At the very least, I don't want to run off the next time I run into trouble. +I want...to have enough courage to face the people I ought to face.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Even if you won't be you anymore? +Your memories will be taken over by a version of you from another world. Will you bear everything of ours and take them to begin your new life?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:I...don't know? +Perhaps that might be a good thing... At the very least, I wouldn't get the people around me involved any further, and I wouldn't have to avoid them with regret and resentment in my heart. +...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:But you won't agree to it, will you?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Everything we have...is just our memories, no? +The delicious things we've eaten, the vintage wines we've drank, the people we've met, the troublesome things we've encountered... + (Sigh)... +I may really be a selfish good-for-nothing, but I can't even bear to abandon my worst memories...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:You do know that if I really wanted to do this...there's no way you could refuse, right?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:I never said it was a bad idea, Julianne. +You're right, I have no idea whether or not this is a problem, but you'll take care of everything, right...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Let's hug, Jill Stingray.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Alright, Model Warrior Julianne Stingray. +...Good heavens, your outfit is really thin. +I really don't want my last memories to be of hugging the thing I fear the most...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Are you afraid of me, Jill?
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:If you could kill me, then why would I be afraid?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:I won't do that. +This is just a hug.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:What...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:Your life has been much worse than mine, Jill. +It isn't a sprawling conspiracy, or a series of adventures, but one built from tiny, troublesome things. +If I really took you over, then I might not even know how to clean up the mess that you left for me. +But...that implies you'll become even more different. +If you can hold your head up high and face it all, you will become better than me. You possess the potential to do that, and I can't just erase that along with you.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:And if I fail? If I run away again, or if...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:There are always surprises in this world. The choices you make may not always give you what you want. +But you have to hold on and never let go of the chances when you have to make a choice. +You cannot decide your fate, Jill. +You can only decide what kind of person you will become when faced with your destiny.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Whew... +I really need to tell Dorothy about this and give her some inspiration for her new T-shirt. +But you know that I'll forget everything you said after I wake up, right?
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:It'll be the same for me too, Jill. I will forget everything that happened inside the gate. +I will return to my world, face an unavoidable apocalypse, and regret not replacing you. I will cry, I will rage, I will be at a loss... +But I will face it all, even if I don't look brave at all while doing it.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Then what should I do? My encounter with you will be as if it never happened...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:It doesn't matter... +It's true that none of this has happened. Our world is nothing more than a dream in the mind of a Griffin Doll. +And I...am just an incomplete projection born from Anna's memories of you, Jill. +Anything I can do, you can surely do too.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:Are...you sure? You seem a lot more complete than me. You can even stand in front of me in clothes I would never dare to wear.
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:And you're brave enough to call yourself a shit-eating piece of shit. At the very least, I would never call myself that. +You see, courage expresses itself in different ways. You will always find the way that will help you deal with your problems.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>;Jillmagic(0)||:I... Alright.... +It looks like I'll still have to figure out a solution of my own... +Ah... this will be a big undertaking...
Jill(2);Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:That's right, no less than saving the world. +I should go. I think there are many people waiting for me to go back and celebrate with a end-of-the-world fireworks party. +Don't embarrass us, otherwise the Model Warrior will come and punish you—
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:Hey, don't you dare say that—
Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:In the name of beauty—!
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||:God dammit! You're even doing the pose!
Jillmagic(0)<Speaker>Julianne</Speaker>||:You'll look back fondly on this pose... +Farewell, Jill Stingray.
Jill(2)<Speaker>Jill</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Hahh... +I always have... +Farewell, Julianne Stingray.
