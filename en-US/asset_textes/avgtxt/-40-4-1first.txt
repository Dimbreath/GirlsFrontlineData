()||<黑屏2><BIN>162</BIN><BGM>event_summer_Title</BGM>:... +On the beach, Suomi gently turns over a rock. +A few tiny crabs hiding beneath the rock are startled and wave their pincers menacingly at her.
KP31(6)<Speaker>Suomi</Speaker>||:... +Excuse me, has the Commander been here?
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Stop wasting time! +Sheesh, where the hell has the Commander gone? Why is that idiot always making us worry?
NTW20(6)<Speaker>NTW-20</Speaker>||:It's okay, no amount of hiding can evade my keen vision.
MP7(2)<Speaker>Gr MP7</Speaker>||:May I remind you that the Caretaker was DROWNING, not playing hide-and-seek! +That's pretty serious, so shouldn't you be a bit more anxious?
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Says you while you're casually sucking on your lollipop! +Hmm, but we've been looking for the Commander for a while now. Is there no other way...?
()||<SE1>AVG_rifle_finalshot_3h</SE1>:Just as everyone is at a loss, the sound of a ferocious gunfight comes from deep within the forest.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:What's that?!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hello? Hello? Is Serdyukov there?</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Or anybody? Please respond if you copy. We found something incredible over here.</color>
FN57(6)<通讯框>;WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Five-seven? That noise is coming from the area you're searching, right?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><通讯框>;WA2000(6)||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, we've engaged the enemies. They look just like the ones who just disturbed our nice vacation.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Could they have captured the Commander?</color>
FN57(6)<通讯框>;WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:That...that's a possibility...
FN57(6)<通讯框>;WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:<color=#A9A9A9>Compared to drowning, this might actually not be so bad?</color>
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><通讯框>;WA2000(6)||:I bet you're thinking it isn't so bad compared to drowning.
FN57(6)<通讯框>;WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:If you read my neural cloud without my permission, I'm never going to forgive you!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker><通讯框>;WA2000(6)||:I didn't, I'm just about to set off to rescue the Commander. +After all, the Commander needs me now more than ever. Don't be jealous~
FN57(6)<通讯框>;WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:...
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Share your coordinates with everyone. We're coming too!
()||<黑屏2><BIN>1</BIN><BGM>BGM_stage1</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:... +WA2000 terminates the transmission angrily. +The forest is raging with gunfire, yet Five-seven is nonchalantly reveling in her success in razzing WA2000.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Heheheh, she IS jealous~
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Um, just to be safe, maybe we should still share our coordinates?
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:Shouldn't we charge over there and wipe them out valiantly?
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Right, I agree with SPAS-12.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Huh? O-okay then, you're probably right...
()||:Five-seven smirks at QJY-88 and points at her own neural cloud.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:You all got that right? R93 sent a distress call and her current location. There's no mistake – the Commander is in danger. +Right now, our job is to cut through the enemies and secure the Commander in what looks like a factory.
()||:Upon confirming their main objective, the group starts advancing towards the factory in an inverted triangle formation. +As they arrive at the main entrance, a swarm of autonomous units come pouring out of the door.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Whoa! Is-is this a trap?!
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:That doesn't matter! Watch me!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Slow down. Can you hear that?
()||:The trio fall silent. The scene is still in chaos, but they can just make out the sound of some very large machinery coming from within the factory, and it's getting closer. +A few panicky shouts can also be heard from time to time.
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:L-look over there!
()||:The Dolls turn towards the source of the noise. It's a safety exit connected to an external flight of stairs. +The door is soon kicked open and three flustered figures come crashing out.
SPAS12(2)<Speaker>SPAS-12</Speaker><Position>0,200</Position>||:It's R93, P38, and the Commander!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:Oooh, it seems the Commander is safe! +Heyyyy!
()||:Five-seven waves at the Commander, who also seems to be waving desperately at her.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:It hasn't been that long since we last saw each other, so why is the Commander so excited?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:No, I think there's something behind them…
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1>:Before QJY-88 could finish, something punches right through the safety exit with a loud boom, leaving a large, semi-circular hole on the wall. +Then the entire wall is knocked down, and amidst the flying dust and chunks of concrete is a massive mech unit.
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:(Pants) I...finally got here... +W-what the hell is that?!
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:It's here to take you somewhere far away~
WA2000(6)<Speaker>WA2000</Speaker>||:Enough already! Where's the Commander?
Type88(4)<Speaker>QJY-88</Speaker>||:Still in there, but...
()||:Detecting enemy units, the mech leaps up with tremendous force and lands right before the Dolls.
FN57(6)<Speaker>Five-seven</Speaker>||:But we'll have to take care of this before we can get to the Commander.
()||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN>:Now that all the Dolls have arrived, it's time to launch a general offensive against these old autonomous units.
