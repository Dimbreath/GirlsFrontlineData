AK12(0)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:Or find a chance to send a distress signal for the rescue party to get in touch.
AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:That is too dangerous right now. We are surrounded by military forces. +Not to mention the ELIDs, who are attracted by the slightest rustles. If reinforcements do not arrive on time, we will not be able to handle the situation with just the two of us.

AN94(0)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:When it is uncertain where the alternative will lead us, I prefer the current option.

NPC-AngeDamage(3)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker>||:(Pants) Goddammit! +Looks like we don't have much of a choice. AN-94, launch the signal flare!
AN94(2)<Speaker>AN-94</Speaker>||:Roger!
AK12(2)<Speaker>AK-12</Speaker>||:How did they find us so soon? We shouldn't have left any traces!
