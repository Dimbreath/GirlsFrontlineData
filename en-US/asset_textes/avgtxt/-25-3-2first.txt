()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>159</BIN><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM><黑屏2>:...Battle concludes. The enemy assault on the outpost is successfully repelled. +...Under the covering fire from the HOCs, the outpost soon settles down again. The Griffin T-Dolls begin inspecting the damage through the pervasive smoke and dust.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:I didn't think we'd actually survive. +We were just taking a one-sided beating, it feels so surreal now.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:The stuff that the Commander brought along is pretty powerful.
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>||:416, thanks to you, our coordination with the Commander was seamless.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Don't mention it. Rather, I wouldn't live up to the position of adjutant if I hadn't done that.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:We can relax for now with them protecting the base. +So what do we do now? Can we get on with rescuing the ones at the other strongpoints?
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Feeling restless again?
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:My friends are still waiting for help. Although... it might be too late now.
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Don't worry. According to our sources, the enemy blockade beyond the perimeter shows no sign of waning, which means they're still alive for the time being.</color>
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Miss Kalin, is the extraction point completely secured?
Python(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Yep, thanks for repelling the enemies! While their attention was diverted, a lot of our T-Dolls have been repaired. They're now standing by in multiple defensive positions.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Moreover, the first transport squadron has arrived!</color>
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:The withdraw is finally underway?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's right, but right now the priority is to evacuate the wounded and non-combat personnel. You may have to stay behind for now and fight.</color>
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:(Sighs) I wouldn't leave even if I could. 9A-91 is still waiting for me. +But now that reinforcements are here, we can go all out, right?
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Miss 416, your squad is a special case and has an injured member. Would you like to evacuate first?</color>
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:I'm staying.
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Pardon?</color>
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You don't have to consider us for the evacuation, we have our own arrangements. Besides, saving more T-Dolls is also more guarantee for our safety. +Instead of trusting this bunch of idiots on the base...I'd rather put my experience to good use.
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>||:Hey, we heard that.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>||:That was mean, but then again you're the adjutant, say what you want!
NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Thank you, 416. You've been immensely helpful.</color>
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:More like, how did you even manage before this...?
HK416(0);NPC-Kalin(4)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>The Commander's work will be over soon, you'll only have five more minutes to catch your breath, make the most of it.</color>
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(4)||:Miss Kalin, may I join the fireteam?
Python(0);NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? Are you going, too?</color>
Python(0)<Speaker>Python</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Since the base is safe for the time being, I'd rather be where I'm needed. +After all, the T-Dolls out there are in grave danger, every bit of  help increases our chance of victory.
Mk12(0)<Speaker>Mk 12</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:I'm going as well! I won't let a rookie look down on me!
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Uh, I told you she's not a rookie. You, on the other hand, are fresh out of IOP's factory, aren't you...?
A91(0)<Speaker>A-91</Speaker>;NPC-Kalin(2)||:Count me in, too. I really want to see for myself what you're made of.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>416, are you okay with leading these T-Dolls?</color>
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:A bunch of headstrong simpletons... +I have no objection as long as they follow my orders.
AK74U(0)<Speaker>AK-74U</Speaker>||:Haha... In any case, we're the only ones here to help. +Welcome to Griffin's Expendables, 416!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...What kind of dumb name is that? +It's even lamer than "404"...
