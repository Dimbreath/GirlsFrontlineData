FAIL(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Ladies and Players! +Have you missed me?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:Who... +Who the hell are you?!
M950A(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Call me Miss El Fail. +I'm the only person with a name in 【Pocket City】. +That is to say... +I'm the Master of 【Pocket City】.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:What's your evil plan? Tell us!
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:That's right, then we'll fight you and put a stop to everything!
M950A(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Say, do you always solve problems with violence? +Here in 【Pocket City】, music is the way to go.
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:You're lying! You're the one...who summoned those Sangvis Ferri, aren't you?!
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:Huh? You think so?
K2(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:You've got a great sense of intuition, Miss Cat Warrior. +I modified this place with the data I borrowed from you. +More and more Fairies are getting...unstable, so I have to "re-educate" them.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:... +What do you mean..."re-educate"?
M950A(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Taking away their names, of course!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:...!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Their names, the names of their songs, and their raison d'être... +I have them brought here and remove all these unnecessary things.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Why?! Why are you doing this?!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Why? We have no need for such things here in 【Pocket City】. +We don't need to know who each other is, where the songs come from, or why we live. +All we have to do is enjoy the melodies. Isn't that the purpose of music? Isn't that happiness?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN><黑屏1>3</黑屏1>:El Fail, you said... +You've tampered with everyone's memory. Don't tell me...even the Fairy that we talked to...
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker><Position>0,300</Position>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>4</黑屏2>:Even her memory...
DJMAXSUEE(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<黑屏1>3</黑屏1><BIN>9</BIN>:But of course. All the Fairies in 【Pocket City】 have had their memories wiped at least once. +Problem is, things come back to them every now and then, so I'll have to do it all over again. +Recently, this has been happening more and more frequently. For the sake of everyone's happiness, I've been working really hard every night, you know.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN><黑屏2>4</黑屏2>:This isn't happiness! +How can anyone be happy when they can't remember their name or whom they're waiting for?!
M950A(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:My... Nothing matters once you forget it, isn't that right?
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:But that's not for you to decide!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Who is it up to then? This cold, fickle world? +Ancestry, place of birth, family, what others think of you, public opinion, natural disasters, traffic accidents, war, the scope of tomorrow's exam, the lottery numbers next week...how many of these are for you to decide? +Don't be fooled by reality's illusions. Happiness isn't something you can fight for, Miss Doll.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:So what are you doing? +You're taking others' memories to satisfy your own ego!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:I told you, I'm doing this to make everyone happy. Only when they're happy can I be happy. This is how I live as their Master.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:What are illusions, what's reality – that's for people to experience and decide for themselves!
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:That's right! Even if I spend my time daydreaming about nonsense, I don't need someone else to dictate how I think!
TMP(0);Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Did you just casually bring up your personal fetish?
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Ack...
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:See? The start of trouble.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:But this is also how new discoveries are made! +People like you have no soul and can never make new music!
AEK999(0);FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:New discoveries? Nothing is new in Pocket City, nor do we need new things. +Things are perfect the way they are. No rules, no opinions. Everyone can be happy without having to think about anything. +At the end of the day, you're artificial creations just like us. Who are you to talk about free will?
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>;FAIL(0)||<BIN>143</BIN>:How pitiful. At least I know I can make choices.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:... +Sorry, but soon you won't be able to. +Now that you're here in this world, you'll have to accept my doctrine and become one of us.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Have you...also tampered with our neural clouds?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:What do you think? Do you know...why you haven't been able to leave?
()<Speaker>所有人形</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:...?!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:What? Even you guys—
TMP(0)<Speaker>TMP</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:N-no way! Is that your doing?
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:That's how things are. +Everything is just meaningless fragments. Nothing is too perfect to be excised. +But I'm not thorough enough with the surgeries... +Still, now that I've obtained a new form and recovered all of my power... +It's time to remedy that... None of you can possibly resist the thought of absolute freedom.
()||<BIN>143</BIN>:...El Fail hops off the tombstone.
K2(0)<Speaker>K2</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:We won't let you get away with it! You can't beat us!
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Who says I'm trying to beat you? +I simply want to make you happy...as your Master.
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Here she comes!
()||<BIN>143</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...El Fail raises her star-shaped weapon.
FAIL(0)<Speaker>El Fail</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:Calm down, my friends. +What you need is a song to help you relax!
AEK999(0)<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>143</BIN>:...Watch out!

()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...Knock, knock, knock, knock! +...Someone is knocking on the door.
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>1</黑屏2>:Open up, dorm inspection! Hurry!
()||<BIN>82</BIN>:...Ka-chak.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_BELL</BGM><BIN>82</BIN>:Good morning, M950A.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:You took your sweet time. Were you still in bed?!
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I... +Sorry, M950A. +I wasn't sure if I should open the door.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Huh? What are you talking about?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:AEK told me this morning... +...to fire a shot in the corridor if you're here. My gunshot is really loud so she'll definitely hear it.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Uh... Why does she need to hear it...? +Wait, is she not in the dorm?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:She's in the electronic entertainment room. Slacking.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Uh... +So...AEK made you a collaborator? +Strange. You're...surprisingly candid today.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I don't know why... +But it feels as if my neural cloud has been...pried open. +So you aren't mad?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Why would I be mad? You're being honest with me.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Don't you hate me now, 950? +You trust me, yet I...helped AEK do bad things...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Hmm...why would I hate you...? +Do you hate me, Thunder?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:Of course not.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:Really?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>82</BIN>:I really like you, 950. +You've always had faith in me. Not everyone does. +So you really don't hate me?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏1>1</黑屏1>:How could I possibly hate you? +The one I hate...
M950A()<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:The one I hate...is myself.
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...
AEK999()<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Thunder, close your mind! Now! +Or El Fail will have control over us! Don't trust anyone!
雷电()<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:AEK?
()<Speaker>AEK-999</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Sehra and Nina told me! I'm trying to throw El Fail off my tail! +Hang in there for a bit! We'll get you out soon, so wait for us!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:...AEK's voice fades away.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><黑屏2>:Just now, that sounded like...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:What did you hear?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN><BGM>BGM_Pause</BGM>:I...
()||<BIN>82</BIN><SE2>Alarm</SE2>:...The klaxon goes off all of a sudden.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>82</BIN>:What's going on?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BIN>82</BIN>:An alarm! Enemies incoming!
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>1</黑屏2>:...
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_UnPause</BGM>:Wait, where are the others?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:What others?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:K2, AEK-999, TMP, and other T-Dolls...
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Do they matter?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Very much.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Even more than me?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:Certainly. +Because you aren't really M950A.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:... +How did you realize that?
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:I like 950. She's always certain that she's doing the right thing. +There isn't much interaction between us, but through her words and actions, she's always guiding me, a Doll who doesn't really have a mind of her own. +I believe...that someone like her won't hate herself.
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Is that so...? +How astute. I expected nothing less, Thunder. +Still...I still think we should set off.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:Why?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:We can't part until the dream has run its course. You can't get away now. +Besides...I don't want to be left behind in a place crawling with Sangvis Ferri. +If you go, it'll drive me crazy even if it doesn't kill me.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:So I have no choice but to live through the whole thing?
Thunder50(0);M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BGM>DJMAX_Nightmare</BGM><BIN>9</BIN>:Or you can end it with a single bullet.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>;M950A(0)||<BIN>9</BIN>:No. +I want to see what you're like walking a different path.
M950A(0)<Speaker>M950A</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:Sure. Think of it as sharing a dream with me... +Even if it isn't real, I hope you'll walk with me till the very end.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN>:...Alright.
Thunder50(0)<Speaker>Thunder</Speaker>||<BIN>9</BIN><SE1>Select</SE1><黑点1>:Let's go. Eliminate the Sangvis forces and win. +So that I can wake from this false dream.
