UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, in the last two hours, unknown signals originating from Tallinn have been continuously trying to connect with M4. Other than that, there has been nothing out of the ordinary.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No other Griffin Dolls have come under electronic attacks. We will continue to provide defensive support.</color>
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's it for my routine report. We need to keep up with their pace and head further into Tallinn.</color>
Commander()||:Is that so...? I see. Keep in touch.
()<Speaker>Commander</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE1>:Hmm?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:Commander, do you have a moment?
NPC-Kalin(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:No problem on my end so far. Is it a transmission from the advance team? That's always a priority. Whenever they get in touch, just patch them through directly.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:No, it's from 16LAB... It's Miss Persica.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:(Here she comes... Exactly as Havier predicted.) +...Put her through.
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:...Click.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>Ah... Commander... Long time no see.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Well...um... I've actually got a lot to say, but now that we're finally talking face-to-face, for some reason...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:It's been months since we last spoke. I'm glad to hear from you.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Good heavens, has it really only been months? It hasn't even been a year, yet it feels like it's been ages.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Yes, I'm sure these last few months...have been really rough...for both of us.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Commander, I'm actually getting in touch to discuss...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4, am I right?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh...</color>
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:As far as I remember, you have never called me for any other reason, so it's an easy guess.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Then I'll cut right to the chase.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've been trying to get to the bottom of the Butterfly Incident this whole time. The place you're going to for your current mission is intimately related to both Lyco and the incident itself.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>However, ever since the last classified military operation, I've been under heavy surveillance and haven't been able to get in touch with my girls in the AR Team...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:A lot happened after that operation.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>(Snorts) I saw the news coverage on Belgrade. Looks like I've fallen really behind on the recent developments.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>So where is the AR Team?</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:They're away on a mission. +I was just about to contact the advance team that M4 is accompanying and check on their progress in Tallinn. Would you like to me to set up a channel for you?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>No! I think we should wait...</color>
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:To be completely honest, I don't really know how to deal with her. It always feels like she's avoiding me. +I think it might benefit M4's mental state to catch up with an old friend during this brief period of free time before the battle begins.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'd still rather not...</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:So, Miss Persica, you want to help M4, yet you don't want to face her. Why is that?
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...It's hard to explain.</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:If you have a job for me or are planning to ask me for a favor, then I'd like to know "why".
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Shouldn't you PMCs act like proper mercs...? Just take the money and don't ask any questions... I'll pay you in full.</color>
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I would've agreed to that in the past. +However, right now I must take the safety of all Griffin members, humans and Dolls, into consideration. You want to protect your beloved creation, while I also want to protect my important subordinates. +Do you honestly think you can buy our mutual trust with money, Persica?
()||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Persica falls silent when confronted with such a sharp question. +After a long time, she finally lowers her head in defeat.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Wake2</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>...I owe that girl...M4...too much.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>M4 is especially precious to me. I wanted to protect her to the best of my ability, and that was how the AR Team came to be...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I kept loading her with unnecessary burdens just to shape her into the perfect masterpiece in my vision. I didn't realize my mistake until she left. What on earth have I done?</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>To satisfy my own selfish desires, not only did I hurt her, I also kept letting her companions get taken away.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I even set her loose back into this cruel and hostile world. My dearest friend got seriously injured because of this...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:...Miss Persica, all birds must leave their nests eventually. +M4 never stopped growing; we are all witnesses to her achievements. You should have more faith in your child.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>That's...not what I meant, but yes, you are right.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:I have another question - how did you find out I'm going to Tallinn? If there's a security loophole in our intelligence system, I must find and seal it.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I've been trying to search for you and the AR Team for a long time, but to no avail.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But since the media have captured many traces of Doll activity in the Belgrade Incident, I was able to surmise that you and the Griffin Dolls were all safe.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Also, Havier seemed to be quite concerned and watchful about the series of events, so...I looked into the transaction records of his personal account.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Oh, so I suppose other than killing Mr. Havier, there is no other way to plug up the leak. Can't be helped then. +Right, now that my question was answered, let's return to the subject. What kind of services would you like me to provide?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I was going to ask you to call back the AR Team and have them return to 16LAB, or at least move them away from the frontlines to a safer location.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>But having listened to you, I think I might have almost made another wrong decision...</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:With the operation already under way, any random changes to my commands or the deployment of our forces would only cause unnecessary confusion. +Even if you had made that request, I wouldn't have agreed to it. +Besides...I have the feeling that M4 is seeking something. I believe even if I gave that order, she wouldn't be willing to leave just like that.
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:<color=#00CCFF>I suppose you're right... Sorry, I was being inconsiderate.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||<BGM>10065</BGM>:It's understandable... Kalin, could you give Miss Persica permission to access our command system as an observer?
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Huh? I certainly can, but giving an outsider direct access to our battle situation...? Are you sure about that?</color>
NPC-Kalin(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:Persica designed the drones we use to transmit our signals; she and 16LAB have been supporting Griffin this whole time, which makes her hardly an outsider. +We're going to face many unknown threats in this operation, so I hope Miss Persica can lend us her wisdom in helping us steer clear of danger.
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Alright, I trust your judgment.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Kalina</Speaker><通讯框>||<SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1>:<color=#00CCFF>Miss Persica, I have given you access clearance as an observer. From now on you'll be able to connect to our battlefield surveillance channel.</color>
NPC-Kalin(3)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:If you see anything suspcious or any potential threats, please notify me. +However, I'll still have the final say when it comes to making any decisions. Is that acceptable, Miss Persica?
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>...Thank you, Commander. I will do my best to repay you afterwards.</color>
NPC-Persica(0)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:How about treating me to a coffee?
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>What?</color>
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||:You said you would make me a coffee back when we first met.
NPC-Persica(3)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Oh... Jeez, what's wrong with me? I completely forgot about that after I moved.</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>By the way, I put lots of sugar in my coffee.</color> <c>Lovely, I'll look forward to it.<c>Oh, what a shame. I'm Team Black Coffee.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||<分支>1</分支>:Lovely, I'll look forward to it.
NPC-Persica(1)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<分支>1</分支>:<color=#00CCFF>You've also got a sweet tooth, haven't you? That's a great discovery. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Commander</Speaker><通讯框>||<分支>2</分支>:Oh, what a shame. I'm Team Black Coffee.
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<分支>2</分支>:<color=#00CCFF>When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Still, I suppose I can make an exception for you, Commander.</color>
NPC-Persica(2)<Speaker>Persica</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏1>:<color=#00CCFF>Anyway, it's decided then. When everything settles down, I'll invite you to my lab.</color>

()||<BGM>BGM_Boss2</BGM><SE2>Gunfight</SE2>:A gunshot breaks the silence that sits upon the ruins. More shots follow and grow increasingly frequent.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Phew, that was close! RO, you alright?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:I'm fine... Dammit, we haven't run into Paradeus, but there are automatic weapon platforms everywhere.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Our objective is to find a safe path for the train to proceed towards the base in Tallinn. +If we leave these defensive facilities be, there's no way the train can pass through the city without taking damage... We must eliminate the mortars along the railway tracks.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:That is true, but some of these turrets are even protected by force fields - very nasty.
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They're giving us a one-sided beatdown here. It's uncertain if we can even withdraw safely, let alone take them out! We need support from the HOC!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:But the HOC are still with the Commander; it'll take them a while to catch up. +RO, aren't you equipped for electronic warfare? Can't you hack into the operation system of those mortars and take control?
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:You make it sound so easy... The problem is that these old turret models switch to an entirely closed circuit once they've been set to auto mode. +In other words, I can only get in by plugging myself directly into their control panels, or connecting to their intranet node!
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What...? Why is it such a pain?!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What do you expect? These systems are ancient stuff from a bygone era. They're such a headache...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Actually, that isn't entirely impossible. We can draw the turrets' attention and cover RO so that she can head for their blind spot and hack them from there... +...What do you think? Does the plan sound plausible, M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(You can do it? Then I'll leave this to you.)
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...That won't be necessary.
AR15Mod(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:But won't that...
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Load your weapons and prepare to move. I'll try to connect to the defense system and deactivate it, but it won't stay off for too long. +After that, we'll have to run directly into Tallinn City Station. Is that clear?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:But how can you possibly do...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_weapon_reload</SE1>:Hush, RO. Trust M4. Get ready and wait for the signal.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<SE2>AVG_tele_disconnect</SE2>:Ready... Three, two, one... Now!
()||:The deafening sound of artillery fire that was resounding through the streets just a second ago comes to a sudden halt.
()||:ST AR-15 throws a rock outside and watches as it roll all the way down the street without triggering any attacks, then she walks out into the open.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||<黑点1><SE2>Runstep</SE2>:Start moving! Head for the station! Be snappy!
()||<BIN>197</BIN><黑点2><SE1>Runstep</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:The Griffin Dolls dash inside Tallinn City Station without a hitch.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:I can't believe it...! All those weapon platforms around the station...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:They don't retaliate even when we fire at them! They're completely paralyzed!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:They all got hacked in one go. How on earth did you do that, M4?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:...I've been given several new modules when I went through my neural upgrade that greatly augmented my electronic warfare capability. +As the leader of the AR Team, I can't afford to keep putting my teammates in danger.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Well done, M4. How's your neural cloud coping with the strain?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Hmm, thanks for your concern... I could use some rest. Gotta catch my breath and let my head cool down a bit.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Don't rely on it too much.
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Right...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What were you two whispering about?
M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Nothing. More importantly, RO, can you do me a favor? While I was trying to hack into the turrets, I detected a network node with very busy data traffic underneath the station. I believe it's the command center of the autonomous defense system... +Find that, and we'll be able to access the system mainframe of Tallinn's city defenses.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:A node, you say...? I'll set off right away then.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:I'll come and help too! Finding things is my forte!

RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<SE1>AVG_footsteps_cave</SE1>:Hmm... Node... Can you see any machine that looks like a computer or a terminal...?
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:What about that at the customer service counter?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Oh, a station control panel of the Intercontinental Railway... That would do.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:M4 was amazing! I can't believe she's that good at electronic warfare! You should learn a few tricks from her, RO.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||<BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:(Mutters) That wasn't electronic warfare at all.
RO635(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Brain</BGM>:Huh? What do you mean?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Hacking into two or three machines at the same time and controling them is achievable through electronic warfare.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:But the way she manipulated several dozen automated defenses was simply... +Infiltrating an internal system that doesn't operate on the Zener Protocol without any physical contact is utterly inconceivable.
RO635(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:...You think M4 lied to us? But why would she do that?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Maybe she did, maybe she didn't. I have a feeling even she herself isn't too sure how she did it... In any case, let's leave everything till the mission is over. +Alright, let me see... The switch should be...here.
()||<黑屏1><SE1>AVG_tele_connect</SE1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Click... Hummmmmm...
()|||<黑屏2><BIN>46</BIN>:The lights inside the station come on all of a sudden. The air conditioning system that hasn't been in use for years also whirs into action, blowing up a puff of dust.
()||:The originally silent underground section of the station is soon filled with mechanical sounds.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:Huh? So the power supply is still operational. That's helpful. +Begin connection. Accessing... Intercontinental Railway Defense System... Good, here it is. M4 do you copy?
RO635(3);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Loud and clear. The lights came on in the main concourse. Was that your doing?</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)<通讯框>||:Yes, the power grid in Tallinn is fully functional. The equipment is in such pristine condition... How should I say this... It's hard to believe all these generators in a contamination zone that's been abandoned for decades are still running normally. +It almost feels as if someone was still maintaining the basic infrastructure even after the city has been sealed off.
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Is that so...? Is the control center of the quarantine wall down there as well?</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)<通讯框>||:No...I haven't been able to access anything related to the quarantine wall. I suppose they wouldn't have put the city's defense system together with the quarantine wall control system.
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>You have a point... Then what about the defense system along the railway tracks? Can you shut it down?</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)<通讯框>||:I can only operate a small number of the turrets around the station from this control panel. A considerable amount of the defensive mechanisms are currently disconnected, but it's shown here that they're still consuming power. +This means they could already be activated and have entered auto mode by disconnecting from the central control room.
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>If you can't deactivate them directly... RO, locate the power generators for me.</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)<通讯框>||:I can do that. They're mostly concentrated around a power plant on the outskirts of Tallinn. Why do you ask?
RO635(0);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>I'm going to cut off those platforms' external power supply.</color>
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4A1Mod(0)<通讯框>||:But even so, the weapon platforms still have auxiliary batteries and won't be put out of action immediately. +It is the safest option to wait for their batteries to run out, but there's no telling how long that's going to take...
RO635(4);M4A1Mod(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Once their power supply is cut off, they won't be able to deploy their force fields as they consume a lot of energy.</color>

G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What? We literally just sat down! I thought I could at least take a nap...
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:And here I thought you were just going to stand by and watch them get wiped out.
