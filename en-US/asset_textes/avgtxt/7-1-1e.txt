RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：M16A1...+Is this the agreed time...?
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑点1>：Yeah...+I don't know what I expected.+Did I hope that I'd hear her voice the second before the call ended, telling me it was all a joke?+Fine... Maybe I really did...+In any case, it didn't happen...+Nothing happened at all...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Truth</BGM><黑点2><BIN>36</BIN>：After that incident, Griffin has withdrawn from Area S08 for good.+HQ could no longer afford to dispatch troops back into a wasteland crawling with Sangvis units in search of a single missing T-Doll.+Our scouts also reported nothing unusual during the 39 days when they monitored the borders from a distance.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>：...+Which means AR-15...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>37</BIN><黑点1>：As a special T-Doll produced clandestinely by 16LAB, AR-15 wasn't equipped with a complete neural cloud, so HQ doesn't have the means to reconstruct her identity.+In other words, AR-15 of the AR Team—the AR-15 who served with M4A1, SOP-II and me—has ceased to exist...+We must at least acknowledge this most terrible fact...
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>44</BIN>：Though actually...things DID get even more terrible than that.
RO635()<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>：M4A1 will be fine. She just needs time.+We must stay strong for now and prepare for vengeance.
M16A1()<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>：I know. Vengence is the greatest solace,+For them as well as for us...+Brief us on this mission, RO. I can hardly wait.
()||<BIN>10</BIN><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>：Area S05, a land of skirmish between Griffin and Sangvis Ferris...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：We are to track a Sangvis Ringleader. Griffin's No.1 most wanted criminal who perpetrated the assaults on many of our contracted areas.+Also...she seems to have returned to her original base after coming into contact with us a month ago.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Dreamer...+So what are we waiting for? Can't we just surround and destroy her?
M16(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：We can't ascertain whether that is her original body or just a dummy. Not to mention she is armed with powerful weapons that far exceed Sangvis Ferris' standard technology.+I've witnessed her destructiveness myself. Any rash attacks would be highly dangerous.+That's why I've enlisted the help of several friends. They have discovered a lot of information during their investigation...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：Friends?
M16(3);RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Before I joined the AR Team, I was the leader of a certain squad—an experience designed to train and test my command module.+They are my former squadmates. I'm pulling in favors asking them for help.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(0)||：You "asked"? ...Through official procedures?
M16(0);RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Grins) I have my ways. +In any case, we need to extract them, as well as their information.+To make this more efficient, you and SOP-II are to rendezvous with them at the pick-up point.
M16(0)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>;RO635(2)||：Got it. What about the Sangvis forces along the way? Area S05 isn't exactly safe these days.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：The commander will take care of them. Let's move once the coast is clear.
