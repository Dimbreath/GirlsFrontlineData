RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Stay here. I'll set up the channel.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Right. Let's rest up a bit...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Could you come with me, 45? I'll need you and M16 to report to Helian in a second.
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:... +Sure.
()||:Other team members are resting on the spot.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:...
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Uh... +Uh...Gr G11?
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:zzzzzz... +zzzZZZZZzzzzz...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:(Sighs)
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:How nice... Being able to fall asleep at will even at a time like this...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Haha... She's always been like that... +Why don't you catch a nap too, SOP II?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Nah, I'm not sleepy at all. +Come to think of it, I've heard a lot about you guys...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Oh? Us? Must be some really nasty rumors, right?
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Not really. I actually think you guys are really cool. +And now that I've met you in person, you don't seem all that strange...
UMP9(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Heheh, how different can T-Dolls be? Not to mention we're now all comrades-in-arms going through fire and water together, right?
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I'd rather not consider going through fire here... +Especially with HER..
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Umm...416...
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:I don't mind either way... +After all, if all hope is lost, I won't really care whom I'm gonna die next to.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Tsk...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:M16... +We're also very sorry...about what happened to AR-15.
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:(Chuckles) You know everything, don't you? As expected of 404... +But thanks. She fulfilled her purpose...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:And about M4... +I'm truly sorry. I hear she...
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:It's not that bad... +Or should I say, it's actually safer for her...
SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Yeah... At least we have RO with us. We don't have to worry too much about our operations.
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Where did she come from? +Why does everyone in your team have this ridiculous hero complex...?
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||:That's none of your business, 416.
HK416(2)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Humph, you're right... +It doesn't matter what I think... Matters to no one...
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:What are you thinking, 416...
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Huh? Gr G11...
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Give me back my blanket...zzzzZZZZ...
()||:UMP45 comes over and claps her hands.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ladies, the sun is coming up, and we need to get a move on. +I've contacted Helian and been told that HQ has dispatched a large rescue team. +However, the aircraft can only transport them to a large heliport on the border.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:So that heliport is going to be our rendezvous point as well as our final destination.
UMP45(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Ja, and let's hope...everyone makes it there safely. ♪
M16(2)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:... +Yeah, I sure hope so...
