TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>||:We're finally out of the lions' den. Thank you very much for your help, Commander.
AR(0)<Speaker>Galil</Speaker>||:But what about Negev? We can't just leave her in there alone.
M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:She's not alone. SOP-II from our team is also in there.+Two suicidal nuts sticking together should have a better chance of surviving, I guess...
TAR21(0)<Speaker>TAR-21</Speaker>;M16(3)||:Glad you're okay, M16.+So what should we do now?+Things aren't going well for Griffin, are they?
TAR21(0);M16(3)<Speaker>M16A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's an understatement... Sangvis forces of this size and that signal jam. Anyone who made it out should count herself lucky.+There simply are too many to rescue. Let's do what we can for now...+And leave whatever's in there to the battle maniacs.

BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker><通讯框>||:What's the matter, AR-15? Still as a statue, aren't you?+If you don't leave, many of your friends won't make it out either.+Well? Are you going to tell me where you've hidden M4?
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||:Alchemist, what...have you done...
AR15(2);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:Me? I merely provoked and misled a few of your squads.+They thought I was the one in charge of the entire attack and just made a beeline at me.+Now all I have to do is trap you here at this crucial pass...
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||:And their comms will be jammed, leaving them helplessly isolated...
AR15(2);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:It'll only take the blink of an eye to destroy these pathetic toys with my troops...+But I've given you all this time to weigh your options...+Give me M4A1's location, or watch me tear your friends to pieces, one by one.
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||<SE1>Battlefield</SE1>:...Don't try to guilt-trip me, Alchemist. Threats won't work either.+Protecting M4 is my order. I will never bow to my enemies!
AR15(2);BOSS-5(0)<Speaker>Alchemist</Speaker>||:Hahaha! I love idiots like you. Your existence is what makes my world so beautiful!+You think the execution is gonna be quick? You think I'll be satisfied with such a short feast?+While you're stubbornly standing by your beliefs, more and more Griffin T-Dolls are coming here to die in vain!
AR15(2)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>;BOSS-5(0)||:Do whatever you want, Alchemist. I don't care what form of cruelty you want to unleash...+Just remember. No matter what you do...+...Only one of us will walk out of this alive.
