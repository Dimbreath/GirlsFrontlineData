G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:45, I have a situation over here! +An encrypted signal of a large Sangvis unit has emerged 400m away from my scouting point! +The signal seems to originate from a small factory. That's probably...
UMP45(2);G11(2)||:
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:AHAHAHAHAHA! +My dear UMP45, are you ready to start running? +Sadly...you've already run out of time!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Destroyer... +Gr G11, keep your eyes on the target! 416, go support Gr G11.
UMP45(2);HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker><通讯框>||:Roger. On my way!
UMP45(2);HK416(3)||:
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Now… Now! Now is the time I make my new debut! +Behold, the body Dreamer designed especially for me, a form as beautiful and mighty as the Goddess of War!
UMP45(2);G11(2)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><通讯框>||:Hey, can't I retreat? What if this lunatic charges at me...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(2)||:Her target is me. You're actually safer where you are. +So make an effort, Gr G11.
UMP45(2);G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:...!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>;G11(0)||<黑屏1>:Keep your eyes peeled and acquire as much information about Destroyer for me before she disappears from your view. +This is our only hope of fighting her, Gr G11. Please!
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>9</BIN><黑屏1>:... +Now I can't very well ignore such fervent pleas...
()||<SE1>Explode</SE1><BIN>62</BIN><黑屏2>:BOOM!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Heheheheh... +AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! +Still struggling, UMP45? +It's no use! NO USE! +I am reborn! No amount of preparation can save you from my overwhelming firepower!
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>63</BIN>:45, the factory where the target is located just collapsed. +I think I caught a glimpse of Destroyer herself. +The smoke is a bit heavy in the area so give me a sec.
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Then keep looking and describe her appearance and weaponry to me when you can.
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:She looks huge. I'm afraid... +Wait a minute...that silhouette looks kinda familiar...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It won't be surprising if her new form is based on her old appearance.
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:No, it's not Destroyer's old model... Something else... +Okay the view is clearing up... +Let me see what the hell she...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Humph... Let me stand up and give this new body a proper stretch! +Now...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BIN>64</BIN><震屏><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:YOU! CAN! ALL! DIE!
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||<BIN>65</BIN><震屏>:PFFFFFFFFT!!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What, Gr G11?! What do you see?!
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:I...I... +I'm probably looking at a...uh...
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:A what?!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<BGM>BGM_Boss</BGM>:... +Huh? What's happening? +Why can't I stand up?
()||:Destroyer tries to lift her front legs off the ground and straighten up, but fails.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Why...why can I only stand on all fours... +Wait, are these my legs?!
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏><BIN>64</BIN>:S-S-S-S-Something's not right!!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:What are you cackling about, Gr G11?! What has Destroyer turned into??
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:S-She became a huge dinergate!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Dinergate? As in...the Sangvis canon fodder that looks like a small dog?
G11()<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:Well, technically, this is a large dog?
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:DREAMER!!! +Answer me! Why am I like this?!
()||:The giant dinergate speaking with Destroyer's voice starts hopping around.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:This is not what we agreed!! +Where's the body that you promised would be as perfect as a goddess's?! And the ultra long-ranged rocket launcher?! +Why...why have you turned me into this?!
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Oh dear I'm so sorry... +My hand must've slipped when selecting the refit order~
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:How could you mix them up?! This looks nothing like a goddess!
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:But the Cerberus model was right next to the Gaia model. +I must've clicked the wrong one and didn't double-check the order. My bad... +But don't be mad at me, okay? It's a bit embarrassing, especially in front of guests.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What am I gonna do?! +How am I supposed to meet the others like this?! How am I supposed to move around and fight?! Hmm?!
()||:The giant dinergate speaking with Destroyer's voice starts rolling on the floor.
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:My, don't be so upset. the Cerberus model is one of our newest projects and has outstanding performance. +Its firepower, armor and maneuverability all far surpass your previous form. +If we overlook the appearance, pffft...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<震屏>:You laughed, didn't you?! You totally laughed! You SO did this on purpose!
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:Nonsense. I'm not that mean, and you actually look pretty cute like this. +Besides, this isn't really the time for that... +UMP45 and her friends are about to escape. If you don't start chasing them, the drone will be gone.
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:What...? +I have to chase them? In this body?
梦想家()<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||:You can do it. I can vouch for the maneuverability of your new body. And now isn't the time for temper tantrums. If you fail the mission, you know what Agent will do to you...
破坏者()<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Tsk, fine...
()||<BIN>9</BIN><黑屏2>:Cerberus-Destroyer slowly gets on her feet.
BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:UMP45 hasn't moved yet. I should still be able to catch her... +W-Which leg should I move first...?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker><通讯框>;BossCerberus(0)||:Dogs run faster when they lunge with both forelegs.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Shut up! I get it! +L-Like this, right?
()||:Cerberus-Destroyer starts adapting to her new body. +Cerberus-Destroyer starts galloping.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Eh? I'm unexpectedly fast. I can easily catch UMP45 at this speed! +But Dreamer, why are you so obsessed with UMP45 rather than the drone?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:Do you believe me if I tell you it's a gut feeling?
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Yours? A Doll's? Why would a Doll have gut feeling...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:I just have a strong feeling...that UMP45 is more important than the drone. +Not to mention, it's obviously easier to capture UMP45. Even if we can't find the drone, it won't be a fool's errand as long as we have their team leader in our hands. +Besides, do you think she's still being truthful now that she knows we can hear her?
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You're right...but the UMP45 sure is a slippery one... +How did you even manage to plant the Parapluie virus on her?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:A year ago, we were just testing out the capabilities of Parapluie and our new potential allies... +So we installed the virus onto a signal jammer and wait for some Griffin T-Doll to take the bait. +To be honest...none of us expected it would be Squad 404.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:So you mean...it was a coincidence? +The virus was dormant for an entire year. Damn, you guys are patient...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:It's our adorable Mastermind who decides when to activate the virus. I'm merely a member of the audience. +Now that Parapluie's rewriting command has been perfected, taking control of UMP45 will be a piece of cake the moment Mastermind orders the hack.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:And that's why...you're asking me to stick close to UMP45... +You just want me to be the zombie computer that hacks into her neural cloud by force??
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:That's pretty much it. The signal should be strong enough at the current distance.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:Tsk. I don't like this at all... +Then you'll rewrite UMP45's neural cloud based on the sample Mastermind has issued...
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>;BossCerberus(0)||:Heheh, Mastermind should be about to make the call. We just have to wait patiently for the area-wide broadcast. +All that's left to do is to enjoy the moment when Squad 404 scrambles around frantically.
BOSS-11(0);BossCerberus(0)<Speaker>Destroyer</Speaker>||:You're rotten to the core, Dreamer... +You're even worse than Ouroboros, Alchemist and Agent combined. +Though I assume you won't place all your bets on me?
BOSS-11(0)<Speaker>Dreamer</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:You do have your clever moments, Destroyer. +There is more than one Cerberus Dummy, but you're the only one who can take care of UMP45. +So for all my hopes and dreams, run.
