M99()<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:M4A1? +Miss M4A1?
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:...Ah. +Sorry... What's the situation?
M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker><通讯框>||<黑屏2><BIN>3</BIN><Night><BGM>BGM_Sneak</BGM>:We have all made it safely through the battle zone. No sign of Hunter being in pursuit.
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M99(0)||:Is that so...? Thank goodness...
M4A1(2);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:P08 bought us this chance with her own life... +So now isn't the time to grieve...
M4A1(2)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M99(0)||:After everything... +I'm not entirely sure...if I even make a good commander...
M4A1(2);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:...If it hadn't been for you, we'd have all died here. +P08 once said that as long as a T-Doll can come out alive with her neural cloud, +Everyone's sacrifice would be worth it...
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:(Sighs)... +(Again with the "you're the only one who can do this"...) +(Why is it always me...)

M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>;M99(0)||:I know... +I don't want to lose anyone else, but I can only try my best...for this objective... +M99, seeing that P08 and Vikhr are both...gone, and Super SASS is engaging the enemy directly... +May I ask you to be my adjutant?
M4A1(0);M99(0)<Speaker>M99</Speaker>||:Oh, sure. +I'm not that experienced, but I'll do whatever I can to assist you.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Good. Please be ready to report any noteworthy Sangvis movements to me. +I'll focus on withdrawing our forces and searching for the transmission device.
M4A1()<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||<黑屏2><BIN>16</BIN><黑屏1>:(...) +(Dammit...) +(I can't let anything else distract me.) +(I have to concentrate and look at the bigger picture...)

M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Understood. I will adjust my tactics accordingly.
M1873(0)<Speaker>SAA</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4A1! I didn't find any Sangvis signal, but there are a bunch of explosives in the warehouse.
M4A1(0)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker><通讯框>||:Got it. Take them with you. They could come in handy later.
