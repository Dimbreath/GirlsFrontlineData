RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：(Panting) We've...lost them...right?
RO635(3);SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I think so... I'm not picking up any signals.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(3)||：(Panting) Chasing after Judge on foot... Not only did we fail to capture her, (panting)...we even got lured into a jamming area ourselves. All our communications are completely blocked and there are several hundred Sangvis troops out there looking to kill us...+(Panting) We're almost out of ammo and power...and the worst part is having to carry this big case around... (panting)+If I had known that I would be suffering like this... I would've...would've stayed with Team Palette. At least AAT's nagging isn't fatal...or at least not so soon... (Panting)...
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Pfft...hahahahaha!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：How...are you still...(panting) able to laugh...at a time like this...?
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sorry, sorry. It's just that you're rambling on and on! Aren't you supposed to be the shining beacon of excellence, RO635?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Tch...you got me...
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What? Are you drained of energy already?+You need to exercise more, RO, and do more logistics work.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Shush! It's because I'm a command-type T-Doll!+Yet, you... How is your stamina so good?
RO635(4);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Because this is my specialty.+Within the AR Team, I specialize in long-distance tracking! It's my role!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：(Sigh) And here I thought your role was supposed to be the interrogator after we track a target down, even though you can hardly call it interrogation...
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Sorry for making you suffer, but I didn't want to miss the chance at locating M16.+You always sounded so serious before, RO, and it always felt like there was something between us. This side of you is much cuter!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Cute? Is this the time to be calling me cute?!
RO635(4);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：This angry side of you is also very cute.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：Don't think that you can get through this one with flattery. I've repeatedly told you to follow instructions. Do you understand the consequences of your actions?
RO635(4);SOPII(2)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I know...but I had to do SOMETHING...+Aren't you the same as well, RO? You could have stayed behind, yet you still decided to come with me.
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(2)||：(Sigh) That's because I promised the Commander that I would bring all of you back. Both you and M16.
RO635(3);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Mhm...I believe in you, as you've proven that you honor your promises.+You're a true member of the AR Team now.
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：I'm very happy to hear you say that...but what should we do now?
RO635(2);SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：I don't know... I'm feeling very sleepy...
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;SOPII(0)||：You must be approaching your limits... You haven't rested for an entire day, after all.+Get some rest now. I'll keep watch.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：I need to think of a way to restore communications... But how...
