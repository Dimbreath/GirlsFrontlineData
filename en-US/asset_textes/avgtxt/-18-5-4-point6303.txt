M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:We're ready to move, 45!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:416! Gr G11! Listen up! +Their electromagnetic cannons take 20 seconds to charge! Hit them as hard as you can to draw the attention of their fire control and leave 10 seconds to reposition! +Got that? Fire everything you've got!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||<SE1>Gunfight</SE1>:On it!

HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That was enough to cut the lifespan of all my parts in half...
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:No time to complain! One more time! 9, get ready to follow me!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:I didn't think we'd actually manage to get through... +45! What's your status?!
UMP45(2)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We're holding on, but just barely! 9, keep close! +416, again!
HK416(3)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:You're all insane! I'M insane!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:My barrel...my gun's barrel is overheating...

UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Coughs heavily) That really hurts!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:AR-15! Cover me! I'm bringing her back!
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:On it!
UMP45()<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It...it hurts so much... So that's how much it hurts to be shot...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Keep quiet! I've dragged her back!
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:45!
HK416(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Are you really insane?! Or are you an imposter?! +You actually did that for us...!
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:(Coughs) You and Gr G11 still owe me... +I can't...let you off so easily...
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Six pieces of shrapnel! Help me cut off signal transmission to the parts where she was hit!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Good thing they're not fatal. Got any Dummies to back up to?
UMP9(4)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:They're all used up!
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Then we'll just have to see how tough she is. +Ange, 45 is injured! +The rest of 404's running low on ammo! Do you have a plan?!
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:45?! Hey, 45!
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:...I'm still hanging in there somehow, but we can't keep up the offensive. Ange, please tell me you have a trump card you haven't used yet.
NPC-Ange(0)<Speaker>Angelia</Speaker><通讯框>||:M4, hold position. We're close to you now. Wait for me and the Griffin forces to come get you!
AR15Mod(5)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Even with the Commander's assistance, our chances of victory are still...
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Got it... 45! Not dead yet?
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:All thanks to you... +But this is what you really want, right?
UMP9(2)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:The detonator?
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Heh... At first I didn't want you to touch such a dangerous thing, but things being what they are now, we don't have any other choice.
M4A1Mod(4)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Thank you. Someone needs to carry out the last resort.
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Think carefully before pushing the button. We'll all be within the contamination radius if you trigger it now. +While Dolls can still move around inside the contaminated zone for a while as long as they avoid ground zero, humans will be severely affected by the radiation...
M4A1Mod(3)<Speaker>M4A1</Speaker>||:Ange and the Commander...
UMP45(1)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:That's right... I've told you the price of pushing the button. What you do next is entirely up to you.
