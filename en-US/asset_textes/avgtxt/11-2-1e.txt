RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you sure it's alright to sneak in here like this...?
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:It's fine. The Fairy has scouted the route out carefully. +Although the route is all sorted, there are a lot of floodgates in the sewers. If the white trash-cans aren't too stupid, they'll have assumed control over them. +If they lock the gates, won't we be caught red-handed?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:You have a point, but we've burrowed in way too deep... It'll be bad news if we get surrounded...
RO635(3);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:We'll leave right away once we finish helping the Commander. Everything will be alright!
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:Are you sure...? +Huh? Is this...a Griffin comms request?
Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker><通讯框>||:<color=#00CCFF>Evening. Miss RO635, right?</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;Mk46(0)||:Uh, hello, and you are...?
RO635(0);Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Mk46. Just sent you my ID. I'm the Commander's temporary adjutant for this operation.</color>
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>;Mk46(0)||:This new girl seems pretty unmotivated...
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0);Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Hey, I heard that...</color> +<color=#00CCFF>Anyways...my assault echelon is prepping their gear right now. They'll reach the entrance of the sewers in ten minutes.</color>
RO635(2)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;Mk46(0)||:Thanks, Mk46. I hope you have enough manpower with you. +Please standby at the designated location and stay put until you're ordered to attack.
RO635(2);Mk46(0)<Speaker>Mk46</Speaker>||:<color=#00CCFF>Right. I'll be waiting for you then.</color> +<color=#00CCFF>The Commander has sent me the mission plan. Once the echelon is in place, we'll be ready to begin the operation.</color>
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:Roger that.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点2><BIN>10</BIN><BGM>BGM_stage11</BGM>:Commander, thank you for your support. I can see the location of the echelon you dispatched. +While we were waiting for you, SOP-II and I have found the control center without alerting the enemies. +I know the location is pretty dangerous, but our echelon can provide more assistance from this side. +Here's my plan – the echelon will block access to the sewers at the entrance while I access the terminal connected to the platform network in the control center. +I'm guessing that the enemies will close the floodgate to cut off our informant's escape route, so I'm going to enter Level II and tamper with their control access to the sewers gate. +After that, SOP-II will head in to find the informant and bring him out, then regroup with our echelon at the entrance.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Can't you simply seize control over the floodgate yourself and lock up the white trash-cans?
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Breaking into the system like that takes a lot more time, but our window of finding the informant is getting smaller and smaller.
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Ugh...fine...
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:I need to devote most of my processing power to hacking into the gate control system, so please take care of the echelon, Commander. +SOP-II, can you mark the gates and nodes on the map for me?
RO635(0);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Sure!
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:I have to boot the enemies out from Level II before they notice me... Right, then let's get started!
RO635(0)<Speaker>??</Speaker>||:Do n— enter th— con— system.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||:What's that...?
RO635(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? What's what?
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>;M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)||:Was that you talking just now...?
RO635(4);M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:No, I didn't say anything at all?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑点1>:Might be my imagination then... +Never mind that, time is short so let's start the operation!
