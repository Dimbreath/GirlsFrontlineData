()||<BIN>2</BIN><BGM>BGM_Danger</BGM>：The battle with Judge continues.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：What...power... We can't even scratch her... She's on a completely different level from the other Sangvis Dolls we've faced before!
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：The Commander's echelons have eliminated the Sangvis troops. We can buy some time for the cavalry to arrive...
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：I'll admit that you're not completely worthless to be able to put up such an attack with just the two of you.+I will ask for the last time before I decide to annihilate you. Where is the Doll named M4A1?
SOPII(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：About that...+I think she's fixing her makeup in the outpost behind me. Ladies need to take their time, you know? Why don't you wait a little while longer?
RO635(3)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Or perhaps you could discard your weapon to show your sincerity. Who knows, M4 might even brew some tea for you!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：......+...So M4A1 is not with you.
RO635(0)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：...And how are you so sure?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：I do not need your assistance, Dreamer. I'll express my gratitude, however, for providing me with information.+Goodness... And here I thought that she must've been in command for you two Dolls to so brazenly trespass into our territory.+...It seems like I came for nothing.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Hey! Are you chickening out?
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：What? Do you think you are a match against me? I would tear your big mouth apart right now if the Mastermind hadn't prohibited me from unleashing my power on you.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Where's M16? Tell me now!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：M16?+That decrepit model? Wasn't she taken away by Dreamer?
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Dreamer? Where is she?!
BossJustice(0)<Speaker>Judge</Speaker>||：How would I know? I've always hated her guts.+However, I'd advise you against provoking her. She's not someone whom you half-baked T-Dolls would be able to go up against.+Treasure your own lives, and think of it as for M4A1's sake. My Master would also be very happy.
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：You still haven't answered my question yet! Don't you dare leave!
()||：...Judge leaves with her jet propulsion system.
RO635(4)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||：Damn it, she's fast! (Cough cough) SOP II?!
SOPII(3)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||：Get back here!
RO635(5)<Speaker>RO635</Speaker>||<黑屏1>：Don't go chasing her by yourself, SOP II! At least wait until the Commander's forces get here...+Damn it! She's not listening at all! I need to follow her!
