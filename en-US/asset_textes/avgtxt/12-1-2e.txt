()<Speaker></Speaker>||<BIN>202</BIN><黑屏2><BGM>BGM_Room</BGM>:...On the armored train.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:The HOC should've taken out all the autonomous units in pursuit. +Is everyone onboard?
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That was too close for comfort. I almost didn't make the jump in time.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||:Huh? It wasn't so bad though – it's just a ten-meter jump.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:I doubt any Doll other than you could jump ten meters on a single bound.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||<黑屏1><BGM>BGM_Empty</BGM>:...Hmm, I think we've got everyone. +Let's head to the equipment room to get some ammo refilled.
()<Speaker></Speaker>||<黑屏2><BGM>m_avg_casual</BGM>:After they replenish their ammunition...
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:You're back! Thanks for the hard work.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:It was hard work, alright. 404 hasn't been asked to fight enemies head-on since god knows when.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Stop complaining. At least we're getting paid.
G11(0)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker>||:This stupid train is finally running... The explosions were getting closer and closer... +I almost thought this train would be my final resting place.
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:Haven't you been staying on the train the whole time? +You make it sound as if you were fighting for your life out there with us!
G11(3)<Speaker>Gr G11</Speaker><Shake>||:Ow, ow, ow, ow... 416, stop pinching my cheeks! I worked very hard to cheer on our maintenance crew!
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:Thank goodness you managed to get the train patched up, or we'd have to travel the remaining distance on foot. +9, you did a pretty great job.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker></Speaker>||:UMP9 scratches the back of her neck sheepishly.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Haha, it was all thanks to Fräulein Kalina and the Dolls that helped.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:I see. But if you ever drag a task past the deadline again, I'll have you and Gr G11 switch neural cores during your next maintenance.
UMP9Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP9</Speaker>||:Ack...!
HK416Mod(0)<Speaker>416</Speaker>||:That would be very interesting. I'll look forward to it.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Incoming transmission from the Commander. +Copy that. +The Commander wants us to assemble in the command center.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:By "us", you mean ALL of us?
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Of course. The Commander wants everyone on Squad 404 to be present as well. It's about the upcoming operation. +Mission briefing is in ten minutes.
UMP45Mod(0)<Speaker>UMP45</Speaker>||:We'll be there once we finish repairing our damaged Dummies.
AR15Mod(0)<Speaker>ST AR-15</Speaker>||:Then the rest of you come with me first.
M4 SOPMOD IIMod(0)<Speaker>M4 SOPMOD II</Speaker>||<黑屏1>:Okay! See ya later!
