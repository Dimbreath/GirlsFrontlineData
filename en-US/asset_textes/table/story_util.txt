story_util-10000002,M4A1's Report: The AR Team has located the data in Safe House 3//c but fell into a trap laid by Sangvis Ringleader "Agent".
story_util-20000002,Dark Information
story_util-10000003,M4A1's Report: We managed to stay until the data transfer was complete//c but were chased into a blind alley before we could evacuate from the safe house.
story_util-20000003,Defend the Base
story_util-10000004,M4A1's Report: We were separated as we fled the battlefield with the assistance of a local Grifon squad//c and were only reunited today…
story_util-20000004,Final Challenge
story_util-10000005,Today//c our commander officially reported for duty and started our first drill with my assistance.
story_util-20000005,Drill
story_util-10000006,We received our first mission from HQ - scouting S.F. movements in the area.
story_util-20000006,Transport the Injured
story_util-10000007,A few T-Dolls survived the Sangvis ambush. We escorted them back to base.
story_util-20000007,Investigate Anomalies
story_util-10000008,With the commander providing cover//c the surviving T-Dolls rescued their captured companion.
story_util-20000008,Missing Party
story_util-10000009,We found the Sangvis Ringleader lurking in the area thanks to information provided by the T-Doll. It seems to be looking for someone...
story_util-20000009,Rescue Signal
story_util-10000010,We defeated Scarecrow but couldn't stop it from transmitting key information to its associate.
story_util-20000010,Operation Uproot
story_util-10000011,The commander was invited by Miss Helian to participate in a special operation drill.
story_util-20000011,Advanced Training I
story_util-10000012,This drill seems to have something to do with talent scouting. Looks like Grifon has very high hopes for our commander.
story_util-20000012,Advanced Training II
story_util-10000013,The commander asked me about Sangvis Ferri//c but I was more concerned about Miss Helian's missing an appointment again...
story_util-20000013,Advanced Training III
story_util-10000014,So Helian is the very "Mixer Underdog" in Grifon gossips. This doesn't bode well... Should I help?
story_util-20000014,Advanced Training IV
story_util-10000015,MP5 is conveying intelligence under the commander's guidance. Her first stop was WA2000. It went well...sorta.
story_util-20000015,Petite Courrier I
story_util-10000016,MP5 got it touch with P7 and gave her some kind of..."education" (?) on behalf of many other T-Dolls. Whatever that means.
story_util-20000016,Petite Courrier II
story_util-10000017,MP5 ran into a bit of trouble but managed to get out of danger thanks to MG5's threats and G36's bribe. All was well.
story_util-20000017,Petite Courrier III
story_util-10000018,With the Commander's help//c MP5 successfully conveyed the intelligence to Miss Helian. But to us//c this is where our work truly begins.
story_util-20000018,Petite Courrier IV
story_util-10000019,We tried to look for ways to make amends//c but to no avail. And so we've been ordered to drop all investigations...
story_util-20000019,Record Trace
story_util-10000020,HQ keeps sending us trivial missions. Guess that means we're back to our daily routine...
story_util-20000020,Emergency Reinforcement
story_util-10000021,We repulsed yet another Sangvis guerilla attack. But it's all for naught if HQ doesn't order us to go on the offensive.
story_util-20000021,Enemy Investigation
story_util-10000022,Persica from 16LAB sent a sudden request for us to collect data under heavy crossfire. Does everyone just let her do as she pleases...?
story_util-20000022,Data Collection
story_util-10000023,Persica still wanted to boss us around. Thank goodness HQ finally ordered us to resume our operation. We can finally return to the battlefield!
story_util-20000023,Additional Commission
story_util-10000024,We defeated Executioner and rendezvoused with Elite T-Doll M4A1 of the AR Team. So she's...the one Sangvis Ferri is after?
story_util-20000024,Termination
story_util-10000025,The Commander has accepted Persica's request to collect parts of Sangvis units as samples for experiment.
story_util-20000025,Field Samples I
story_util-10000026,Persica doesn't seem keen on contacting M4A1//c even though she'd given us all sorts of aid off the record in finding her...
story_util-20000026,Field Samples II
story_util-10000027,M4A1 got in touch with Persica her and dispelled Persica's sense of guilt for issuing her previous request. It's nice that she no longer feels burdened.
story_util-20000027,Field Samples III
story_util-10000028,We've fulfilled Persica's request//c but initial analysis reveals great differences between the technologies behind Sangvis and Grifon T-Dolls. How on earth did Sangvis Ferri come to be?
story_util-20000028,Field Samples IV
story_util-10000029,We provided cover for Thompson's squad to reach their bases. They're gonna assist the military in suppressing rioting armored machines.
story_util-20000029,Professional Help I
story_util-10000030,Thompson managed to put every unruly T-Doll demurely in their place - such tact!
story_util-20000030,Professional Help II
story_util-10000031,The military messed up our plan by advancing the operation//c but we always have an ace up our sleeve...
story_util-20000031,Professional Help III
story_util-10000032,We snatched the data from the control room//c and the military could say nothing about that... Mission accomplished - small revenge also accomplished.
story_util-20000032,Professional Help IV
story_util-10000033,The commander's performance so far has been acknowledged by HQ. We've been ordered to press ahead and recover all lost territories in Area S09.
story_util-20000033,Clearing a Path
story_util-10000034,As we move//c M4A1 has been contacting other members of the AR Team//c from whom she was separated during a certain mission.
story_util-20000034,Intercepted Intelligence
story_util-10000035,The commander successfully recovered SOP-II from the AR Team//c but learned that AR-15//c who had stayed behind to bring up the rear//c was still missing.
story_util-20000035,Covert Reinforcement
story_util-10000036,The Command Post was ambushed. We managed to return just in time to defend it thanks to intelligence provided by SOP-II.
story_util-20000036,Defensive Operation
story_util-10000037,HQ ordered us to search for the local Sangvis Ringleader's base. It's pretty eyecatching//c all right//c but we just can't get in...
story_util-20000037,Swift Counterattack
story_util-10000038,Hunter's base fell into disarray all of a sudden//c then AR-15 emerged from within//c covered in injuries. What on earth happened in there...?
story_util-20000038,No Hunting
story_util-10000039,I applied for this mission without consulting the commander//c but the commander still decided to accept the challenge even though it was much harder than I expected. All the best!
story_util-20000039,Data Retrieval I
story_util-10000040,We have recovered a few military hard disks but can't read the content... I'm dying to know what's inside... 
story_util-20000040,Data Retrieval II
story_util-10000041,Sangvis forces came after the hard disks//c which means they're a big deal to them. They must contain some kind of important data!
story_util-20000041,Data Retrieval III
story_util-10000042,The commander listened to some of the recordings on the hard disks after the mission and looked a bit grave... Does S.F. still have many aces up their sleeve? 
story_util-20000042,Data Retrieval IV
story_util-10000043,Makarov requested the commander to assist her in infiltrating Sangvis territory to rescue the trapped Nagant M1895.
story_util-20000043,Anonymous Rescue I
story_util-10000044,Despite Makarov's misgivings toward her aids//c the operation has been going smoothly so far.
story_util-20000044,Anonymous Rescue II
story_util-10000045,We rescued Nagant M1895//c but Makarov's squad ran into danger. I hope her escape plan wouldn't be too outrageous...
story_util-20000045,Anonymous Rescue III
story_util-10000046,Mission accomplished. We have recovered the important item in Nagant M1895's hands. Hopefully it'll prove useful to subsequent operations//c otherwise...
story_util-20000046,Anonymous Rescue IV
story_util-10000047,We provided support and cover for an elite squad in regaining full control over Area S09. Sadly we still never found out who they were in the end.
story_util-20000047,Assist the Mercenaries
story_util-10000048,We received prior information about the local Ringleader for this operation//c and we finally got in touch with M16A1//c the last member of the AR Team. All is going well.
story_util-20000048,Cut Off Reinforcement
story_util-10000049,"Intruder" showed itself and taunted us//c but we had already fought our way into its territory.
story_util-20000049,Break Through Enemy Lines
story_util-10000050,As we were heading deeper into enemy territory//c we suddenly received an order to search for that elite squad from before. We seem to have lost track of them...
story_util-20000050,Search for Companions
story_util-10000051,That elusive squad seemes to be out of danger and has even left us coordinates denoting the weak spots in the Sangvis base's defense. That's how we managed to get in.
story_util-20000051,Locate the Coordinates
story_util-10000052,Control over Area S09 is fully restored//c and M16A1 is also back with us. But she has brought unsettling news... What exactly is Plan "Parapluie"?
story_util-20000052,Eradicate the Disturbance
story_util-10000053,While carrying out an investigation suggested by M4A1//c we stumbled across a cryptic audio file that seems to have come from a T-Doll's neural cloud.
story_util-20000053,Reminiscing I
story_util-10000054,SOP-II joined us in the investigation and confirmed the rumors about her... Innocence doesn't necessarily have to be cute//c though she's still pretty cute as she is.
story_util-20000054,Reminiscing II
story_util-10000055,AR-15 also helped//c then gave M4A1 a lecture. She's always so oblique...but nonetheless very reliable.
story_util-20000055,Reminiscing III
story_util-10000056,The AR Team listened to the combined audio recordings and decrypted them with my help. The file they ended up getting was...
story_util-20000056,Reminiscing IV
story_util-10000057,The commander was invited to attend a clandestine meeting to discuss measures of countering Plan "Parapluie"//c but lost contact with us five minutes ago. What on earth is going on?
story_util-20000057,Drill Attendance
story_util-10000058,Sangvis Ferri caught wind of the location of the base and surrounded it. Thank goodness the commander is safe//c and is now entrusted with the counterstrike by Mr. Kryuger.
story_util-20000058,Raid Resistance
story_util-10000059,Miss Helian found the local Sangvis command post//c but "Destroyer" somehow learned of this and managed to give us the slip.
story_util-20000059,Counterstrike
story_util-10000060,HQ believes AR-15 is the source of the leak and has taken her away... This is ridiculous! How could it be AR-15... This can't be right...
story_util-20000060,Safeguard Retreat
story_util-10000061,AR-15 has gone AWOL. Without even a single word...
story_util-20000061,Internal Phenomenon
story_util-10000062,AR-15 deserted us//c but we fought off Sangvis Ferri... Does that make it a victory or a loss? Though compared to the mystery we're faced with//c this is actually nothing...
story_util-20000062,Order to Pursue
story_util-10000063,The AR Team had previously encountered a baffling and terrifying airstrike while in pursuit of Destroyer. They had no choice but to make a hasty retreat...
story_util-20000063,Solving the Mystery I
story_util-10000064,We ran into Mr. Kryuger during the search for AR-15. What is he investigating...or reflecting on here?
story_util-20000064,Solving the Mystery II
story_util-10000065,Everyone on the AR Team is in a terrible state//c but they all know where their duties lie. The commander and I should probably try to console them a bit later on...
story_util-20000065,Solving the Mystery III
story_util-10000066,We were just notified by HQ that a new operation is about the commence... I hope we can prepare in time for whatever that's coming our way...
story_util-20000066,Solving the Mystery IV
story_util-10000067,A few days later//c Squad Negev of Grifon was ordered to search for AR-15 in Area S08//c but they've gone missing there. Their comms modules are also jammed.
story_util-20000067,Squad Negev
story_util-10000068,The AR Team went in to investigate//c and successfully rendezvoused with the squad member dispatched by Negev to send the distress signal. We then lanched the rescue mission.
story_util-20000068,Double Rescue
story_util-10000069,We fended off "Alchemist". Squad Negev got out of danger//c but we've lost track of M4A1 and SOP-II when their signal got blocked again…
story_util-20000069,Reunion
story_util-10000070,M16A1 found SOP-II unconscious//c but a large amount of Sangvis forces have suddenly swarmed into Area S08 so we must move out immediately!
story_util-20000070,Prisoner
story_util-10000071,The commander has rebuffed the Sangvis vanguard for the time being//c but Negev made a spine-chilling conjecture - AR-15 is the source of the jam...
story_util-20000071,Resolve
story_util-10000072,After a long and brutal fight//c all T-Dolls have withdrawn from Area S08...except...AR-15...
story_util-20000072,Late Farewell
story_util-10000073,AR-15 was trapped by Alchemist during the withdrawal. Meanwhile//c Grifon's troops were also in grave danger...
story_util-20000073,Final Wish I
story_util-10000074,SOP-II took the risk of heading onto the battlefiled and created an opening for AR-15 just in time. She also bought time for the rest of our troops to retreat safely.
story_util-20000074,Final Wish II
story_util-10000075,M16A1 returned with a message from AR-15. As the host of "Parapluie"//c there's no coming back for her. The only thing she can do is…
story_util-20000075,Final Wish III
story_util-10000076,AR-15... The commander and I have no idea what you did in the end... All we know is that...you saved all of us...

story_util-10000080,RO's Report: Mission accomplished. I hope we will have all the fun we can tonight...as I shall be heading over to the AR Team tomorrow to take over from HER.
story_util-20000080,One-Week Teammates IV

story_util-20000083,Daily Patrols
story_util-10000084,The signal is blocked in the detention center. Meanwhile//c a large number of Sangvis units have suddenly appeared within Area S05...
story_util-20000084,Ambush

story_util-20000085,Cat and Mouse
story_util-10000086,We have no way of knowing the situation inside the detention center. All we can do is to prepare for the final battle. I hope the assistants sent by Persica will be of use to us...
