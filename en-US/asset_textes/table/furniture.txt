furniture-10003109,Never-ending Night Wine Rack
furniture-20003109,The champagne rack seems to be a staple at all anniversary parties. Every guest would take a flute in their hand//c then hand it back to the waiter//c completely untouched.

furniture-10040504,Chameleon
furniture-20040504,If you're very confident in your reflexes and concentration//c raising a chameleon might be a good choice. After all//c they're visible for only a moment when they flee//c after which they vanish into your house and their corpses can't even be found.
furniture-10040505,Innocent Seal
furniture-20040505,It's just an ordinary seal. It doesn't jump around in front of humans//c and it doesn't follow its observers with a penguin in its mouth. All it does is quietly waiting in the base's imitated Antarctic sector in the hope that it won't be bullied.
