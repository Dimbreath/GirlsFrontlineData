bondage_lines-10000001,Miss Desert Eagle//c will you also come and watch the next performance? There's a bunch of new things I still want to try!|What kind of new things? |Ever since I got the right feel//c my performances have been going a lot more smoothly. But I don't want to stay within my comfort zone of singing relaxing songs. I also want to branch out into more technically challenging songs and even rock music.|You have talent//c P38. Don't be in such a hurry to leave your comfort zone. Perfect what you're good at first.|Oh...I shouldn't aim TOO high. You're right//c I should focus on honing my skills for now. Heheh... Will you come and listen to my songs again?|I've always been listening.|Always?|The music in "Apprentice Witch" is pretty awesome. What's the matter?|...Sorry//c please let me lean on your shoulder for a bit. I'm so happy I'm overheating...
bondage_lines-10000002,It's all thanks to Gr HK45's support that I could muster my courage//c understand my strengths and show them off appropriately!|Yep//c this is what a star should do - keep shining and lighting up everyone's heart!|As the lead singer//c I'd better work even harder! Light up both the stage and the battlefield with my songs!|Singing on the battlefield would expose us to our targets?|You're right. But if we ever get to work together//c I'm happy to write a duet.|I look forward to working with you on stage again! As for the battlefield//c that depends entirely on the Commander~|I'll do my best!|Alright! Let's set off to a brilliant future!
bondage_lines-10000003,We did it//c Spectre M4! Now we must step into a wider world!|Ugh...|Huh//c what's wrong?|Someone actually commented//c "Who's this girl? She's so pretty. Never seen her at the base before~" on Griff-chan...|Oh//c well... At least you were noticed. You'll have even more fans in the future!|I know//c but that's really mean! I've been working here since a long time ago!|Everyone is very busy//c after all... By the way//c may I ask you a question?|Go ahead... (Sobs)|Where were you standing that day at the concert? I didn't see you.|... (Bawls)
bondage_lines-10000004,Spectre M4 worked very hard this time. Sweat and toil are key to making it to the stage!|My effort has been noticed! That makes me so happy! My popularity is rising...|Now the next goal is...|To improve my skills as an accompanist and memorize the music score!|Those are important//c but first you should work on making people remember your name.|Does no one remember my name at all? Huh?!!
bondage_lines-10000005,I can't believe I received pointers from someone as experienced as Desert Eagle... This is such an honor!|You flatter me. I'm just a retired performer.|Are you never returning to the stage? You were so famous//c you still have fans all over the world!|I will never return to the stage//c but I'm always keeping an eye on it.|Wow//c having her attention on me is both stressful and gratifying...|I'll watch you//c as well as all the actors who make frequent appearances on the big screen//c whenever you perform. There are always people who wish to brighten up the world with their own brilliance.|What about you? Are you happy with your present life?|I suppose I am. If we put our heart into it//c we're always playing different roles. A protector//c a guide//c or simply a friend whom you can talk to.|Oh! Do you mean I can also...I'm also...?!|Before you get too excited//c practice the sequence one more time.
bondage_lines-10000006,Heheh//c I made quite a fortune this time. It was neither embezzlement nor usury//c it was completely legal. I'm such a genius! Who should I target next?|Stechkin//c isn't there something you should say to me?|Why do you look so disapproving?|You know very well what you did//c and you think I would approve?|Alright//c alright//c don't be angry. I did use your name... How about we split this 80/20?|...|...70/30? 60/40//c I won't go any lower! Alright//c 50/50! Still no?|You don't seem to have grasped the severity of what you've done...|What are you doing? Wait//c stay away! HELP!
