<color=#ffb400>Heliports</color> will not only increase your Action Points, but will also provide a resupply point for your Echelons.
<color=#ffb400>Common</color> T-Dolls are easier to <color=#ffb400>Dummy Link</color> and will gain greater battle capabilities from doing so.
Echelons who've <color=#ffb400>exhausted</color> their rations can move, but they become extremely weak and must resupply at a <color=#ffb400>Heliport</color>.
The maximum number of Echelons that can be sent to Logistic Support is <color=#ffb400>4</color>.
Investing more enhancement materials will increase the enhancement effect.
The enhancement effects provided by each gun type is <color=#ffb400>different</color>. ARs are the most balanced.
Completing the battle, production, and enhancement <color=#ffb400>daily missions</color> will reward <color=#ffb400>three</color> Dummy Cores in total.
The gun type abbreviations are: <color=#ffb400>HG</color>=Handgun, <color=#ffb400>SMG</color>=Submachine gun, <color=#ffb400>AR</color>=Assault rifle, <color=#ffb400>RF</color>=Rifle, <color=#ffb400>MG</color>=Machine gun, <color=#ffb400>SG</color>=Shotgun.

In non-Night battle stages, an Echelon must be <color=#ffb400>deployed</color> on the <color=#ffb400>Command Post</color> before battle can begin.
Machine guns (<color=#ffb400>MG</color>) have exceptional firepower, but ammo consumption is high and are unable to attack while reloading.
Submachine guns (<color=#ffb400>SMG</color>) have excellent evasion and health and are suitable for the frontline.
Assault rifles (<color=#ffb400>AR</color>) are generalists and have balanced attributes.
The <color=#ffb400>same T-Doll models</color> or <color=#ffb400>Dummy Cores</color> can be used for <color=#ffb400>Dummy Linking</color>.
<color=#ffb400>Heavily damaged</color> T-Dolls will have greatly increased repair costs. Please <color=#ffb400>repair</color> damaged T-Dolls regularly.
While in battle, tapping on a T-Doll and selecting <color=#ffb400>retreat</color> on the top left corner can prevent individual T-Dolls from being completely defeated.
Total defeat can be avoided in battle by tapping <color=#ffb400>pause</color> on the top of the screen and selecting <color=#ffb400>retreat</color>.
Echelons can <color=#ffb400>withdraw</color> from the battlefield at any time. However, withdrawing on <color=#ffb400>normal nodes</color> will <color=#ffb400>forfeit</color> all the ammo and rations held by the Echelon!
Withdrawing from the battlefield at <color=#ffb400>Heliports</color> and the <color=#ffb400>Command Post</color> will <color=#ffb400>not consume</color> any Action Points, and the Echelon's ammo and rations <color=#ffb400>will not</color> be forfeited.
Withdrawing an Echelon will be counted as a <color=#ffb400>loss</color>. This may affect your chances of obtaining a <color=#ffb400>S rank victory</color>.
Rifles (<color=#ffb400>RF</color>) will prioritize targeting the enemy back row, reducing pressure on the front row allies.
Deploying an Echelon will consume <color=#ffb400>manpower</color>. The manpower consumption will increase along with the number of T-Dolls and Dummy Links in the Echelon.
An Echelon will consume <color=#ffb400>10% rations</color> each turn. Each battle will consume <color=#ffb400>20% ammo</color> and <color=#ffb400>10% rations</color>.
<color=#ffb400>Without resupplying</color> midway, fully supplied Echelons can only enter battle <color=#ffb400>5 times</color> and will be <color=#ffb400>exhausted of ammo</color> thereafter.
A <color=#ffb400>resupply</color> can be carried out by remaining at allied <color=#ffb400>Heliports</color> or <color=#ffb400>Command Post</color> for a turn.
Combat Simulation - <color=#ffb400>Data Mode's</color> completion time will directly affect the amount of <color=#ffb400>Training Data</color> gained. The shorter the time the higher the amount.
Combat Simulation - <color=#ffb400>EXP Mode</color> involves defeating <color=#ffb400>a map full of enemies</color>. Further Echelons <color=#ffb400>cannot</color> be deployed once the simulation begins.
The <color=#ffb400>Training Data</color> used for leveling up skills can be obtained in Combat Simulation - <color=#ffb400>Data Mode</color>.
Skill Training can <color=#ffb400>increase the levels</color> of T-Dolls' <color=#ffb400>skills</color>.

<color=#ffb400>Limited drops</color> in event stages <color=#ffb400>can drop</color> from nodes other than the BOSS nodes.
<color=#ffb400>Battles</color> and <color=#ffb400>Auto-Battles</color> can <color=#ffb400>increase</color> T-Dolls' Affection. If they or an ally <color=#ffb400>dies</color> in battle, Affection will be <color=#ffb400>decreased</color>(except in Boss battles).
Combat Simulation will not affect Affection.
When affection reaches <color=#ffb400>100</color>, <color=#ffb400>Oath</color> becomes available.
The <color=#ffb400>higher</color> the amount of contracts, cores, and resources invested in Equipment Heavy Production, the easier it is to produce <color=#ffb400>Fairies</color>.
Logistics Great Success will guarantee an item drop from the rewards list.
The chance for logistics Great Success is related to the average level of the Echelon.

The order of <color=#ffb400>calibrating</color> and <color=#ffb400>enhancing</color> an equipment does not matter.
T-Dolls added into an Echelon will enter the corresponding dorm. T-Dolls in dorms will gain <color=#ffb400>Affection</color> according to the <color=#ffb400>level of Comfort</color> over time.
When a certain number of <color=#ffb400>furniture within a set</color> is reached, <color=#ffb400>additional Comfort</color> will be gained.
Furniture and costumes can be obtained using <color=#ffb400>Tokens</color> through <color=#ffb400>procurement</color>.
Commanders can <color=#ffb400>give gifts</color> to T-Dolls in the <color=#ffb400>dorm</color> to increase their <color=#ffb400>Affection</color>.
<color=#ffb400>Tokens</color> can be obtained through completing <color=#ffb400>daily quests</color>, <color=#ffb400>weekly quests</color> and <color=#ffb400>Logistic Support</color>.
