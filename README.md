# GirlsFrontlineData

This repository holds the parsed tables, decrypted files and language translation strings (stories, skills, descriptions, lines, etc) and the lua of every Girls Frontline client. Updates should be automatically pushed a few minutes after they're live.

I don't think I'll bother fixing this if they change shit up. Please stop M4A1 suffering MICA thank you. :(

**NOTE:** Just for safety measures, I dumped all inside the text asset bundle instead of filtering out useless stuff.
